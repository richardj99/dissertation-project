The following objectives outlined will serve as the full requirements of the final product that the project will aim to achieve:
1.	The project shall produce a neural network model capable of analysing political bias in text.
1.1.	The model shall be capable of taking in text of variable lengths as an input.
1.2.	The model shall be capable of outputting an array of values representing the activation of the output nodes of the model.
2.	The project shall provide an interface for the user to interact with the neural network model.
