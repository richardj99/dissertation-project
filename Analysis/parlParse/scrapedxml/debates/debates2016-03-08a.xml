Further action is being taken. As the Prime Minister announced on <phrase class="date" code="2016-02-08">8 February</phrase>, we have introduced in the Policing and Crime Bill a new clause that requires defendants appearing in court to provide their name, date of birth and nationality. That is an important tool, backed up by a criminal offence for failure to respond that will help us to remove even more FNOs. That is vital for public protection and vital to saving precious taxpayers&#8217; money.</p>

It provides a significantly improved level of care, compared with the mean level offered by many other custodial establishments. I think that the spirit of the SIB lives on, both in Transforming Rehabilitation and in the way in which Peterborough prison operates, but I am open to other ideas about how social investment can help to improve the justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require applicants for full driving licences to have received first aid training before undertaking the practical driving test; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/3">Britain has some of the safest roads in Europe, but there is still more we can do to reduce the death rate. In the last 12 months, 1,780 people were killed on British roads, and 23,700 were killed or seriously injured. Land transport accidents are one of the top five biggest killers of both males and females between the ages of five and 34. In such situations, where someone is seriously injured or fighting for their lives, every second counts. A review of road traffic in Europe cited by the World Health Organisation claimed that 50% of deaths from road collisions occurred within a few minutes of the crash, so there is often not time for an ambulance to arrive. Knowledge of first aid can be absolutely critical. The immediate initiation of CPR, for example, can double or even quadruple survival from cardiac arrest.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/4">The sad reality is that in Britain, knowledge of first aid is patchy. Through no fault of their own, many people do not feel confident enough to intervene and provide first aid in crash and accident situations. A survey for St John Ambulance found that 59% of people would not feel confident enough to save a life. At the scene of an accident, 24% would do nothing until an ambulance arrived or a passer-by who knew first aid appeared. Those are troubling statistics, but I hope that they set the scene for the Bill that I am introducing to require first aid training as a requirement of the driving licence application.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/5">Many other European nations already require driving licence applicants to undertake such training. In order to qualify for a driving theory test in Switzerland, applicants must prove that they have undertaken 10 hours of first aid instruction from a company approved by the Swiss Government. Since 2016 in Germany, there has been a single first aid course for applicants for all categories of driving licence. That course takes seven hours and consists of nine 45-minute lessons. In the Czech Republic, learners must take obligatory lessons in a driving school, including four 45-minute first aid lessons. Other countries that require first aid as a condition of receiving a driving licence include Austria, Slovenia, Hungary and the Baltic states.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/6">Introducing such a requirement would make a huge difference to our population&#8217;s knowledge of first aid. Around 63% of the population aged between 21 and 29 have a driving licence. If that figure remained steady, in about 13 years the proposal would have helped to ensure that nearly two thirds of those aged under 30 in Britain were potential life savers. Far more drivers would feel confident enough to step forward in the event of a crash or any other emergency situation. First aid knowledge and skills would also make new drivers more aware of the potential dangers on the road, and of the perils of speeding and reckless driving.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/7">The Bill is a great opportunity to boost the ability of a substantial proportion of the British population in an important skill. Every year, as more young drivers receive their licence, the number of British people who have first aid training will rise. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the change has the potential to save hundreds of lives. Indeed, it reinforces the Government&#8217;s strategy to improve road safety and reduce the number of people killed on our roads by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/8">A Conservative Government first introduced the stand-alone theory test in 1996. It is a tough test, and so it should be. The pass mark is 86%. It helps to ensure that applicants for a full driving licence have a good knowledge of the Highway Code and can spot potential dangers through the hazard perception test. At the time, some claimed that the stand-alone theory test was unnecessary, but since it was introduced, road fatalities in this country have more than halved. The theory test may have played a role in that reduction. Since 2007, the theory test has contained a number of first aid questions, and that was a good development, but I believe that it is time to introduce a requirement for stand-alone practical first aid training as another condition to obtaining a licence. This reform is supported by both the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance. Those two groups recognise the transformative effect that first aid can have in accident situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/9">Last year, I supported the private Member&#8217;s Bill to make first aid lessons compulsory in schools. Some opponents of that Bill claimed that it would put too much pressure on school timetables and undermine the discretion of teachers, and I understand such concerns. That is why I think my Bill is a good compromise. British people should have the opportunity to learn such skills through their lives. It would help to boost the first aid skills of many more British people. Surely we want to foster an environment in which people are more willing to step forward and help in an emergency. The Government&#8217;s Social Action, Responsibility and Heroism Act 2015 aims to do that by removing the fear of liability for those who help out, but how can we expect people to act if they do not have the skills and confidence to do so?</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/10">I propose that attendance at a four-hour practical first aid course, run by an approved first aid provider, should be a minimum requirement for receiving a full driving licence. Evidence of the training would have to be produced before allowing an applicant to take a practical test, as with the current theory test. The change would be made by amending the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.2/11">I hope that I have done this proposal justice in such the short period available. I truly believe that introducing the change will have a transformative impact on the British public&#8217;s knowledge of simple, but life-saving techniques. So many of the British public lead busy lives. The introduction of this reform would ensure that the majority of young people were required to take the time to learn these skills. Indeed, I believe that many would welcome the opportunity provided by this reform. Moreover, I am encouraged by the fact that Members from six separate parties have agreed to sponsor the Bill, which shows a degree of cross-party support for the proposals. Put simply, this change will give many more British people the chance to learn life-saving skills and, potentially, to save a life. I urge colleagues to support the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.2/1">New clause 4 might be referred to as the &#8220;hokey-cokey clause&#8221; because it has been in, out, and shaken all about during the passage of the Bill. I am not exaggerating when I say that, because this new clause should still be in the Bill. You may not be aware of this, Mr Speaker, so I will read briefly from the record about what happened with this clause in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/2">In Committee the Chair put the question that clause 32 stand part of the Bill, and hon. Members responded &#8220;Aye&#8221;. The Chair asked for votes to the contrary, and said, &#8220;I think the Ayes have it.&#8221; The Minister then moved that the clause should not stand part of the Bill, and I raised a point of order to the Chair to point out that the Committee had just voted that the clause should stand part of the Bill, and that the Minister could not then move that it should not. The Chair then said:</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/3">&#8220;For clarity, I will put the question again.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Enterprise Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2016-02-23">23 February 2016</phrase>; c. 201.]</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/4">The clause was accepted in Committee, but the vote was taken a second time because the Chair, in a spirit of extraordinary generosity and to save the Minister&#8217;s blushes, allowed a second vote. First the clause was in, then it was out, and today we are suggesting that new clause 4 should again be included in the Bill. It is not really a new clause; it was clause 32 when we considered the Bill in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/5">The Government are wary of new clause 4, or old clause 32, because they fear that the Green Investment Bank&#8217;s borrowing would, because of the position taken by the Office for National Statistics, remain on the Government&#8217;s books and be classed as public sector debt after privatisation. If there were any suggestion of statutory control of the Green Investment Bank&#8217;s purpose, the ONS would insist that it stayed on the books.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/6">There is currently statutory control of the Green Investment Bank&#8217;s purpose, to ensure that it is green and not just like any other investment bank. The Green Investment Bank is supposed to be a different kind of entity; it is not supposed to be like the bank that the Secretary of State worked for when he earned &#163;3 million a year, and which was fined &#163;600,000 by the European Union for fiddling interest rates. It is not supposed to be that kind of institution; it is supposed to be completely different and focused on sustainable investment in green projects, not based on the unsustainable culture of greed that brought the world economy to its knees in 2008, with millions of hard-working families still suffering the consequences of that. If the Green Investment Bank is meant to be a new kind of institution, how do we ensure that it remains so if the Government strip it of its statutory purpose, which is to invest in green projects?</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/7">In Committee we asked whether the Government should allow that potential ruling by the ONS to drive completely policy in this important area of sustainable public policy, but the ONS point is a technical matter. If the Green Investment Bank remains on the books after privatisation, that does not reflect any problematic public debt. It may cosmetically spoil the look of the Chancellor&#8217;s forecasts on public debt, but it would not change the fundamental underlying substance of public finances. In other words, statutory protection for the Green Investment Bank&#8217;s purposes is to be removed by the Government because of an accounting convention that is inconvenient to their political narrative. It is spin over substance on stilts.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/8">As we discussed in Committee, the Green Investment Bank is not getting the same treatment as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The Treasury is all too ready to allow UK borrowing to be part of financing that bank, and it was not worried at all that public debt will be part of its financing. However, it is extremely reluctant to allow the same treatment for the Green Investment Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.2/9">You will not be surprised to hear, Mr Speaker, that I praised the former coalition Government for introducing the Green Investment Bank. Policy in that area can be difficult to implement, because by its very nature it is new and innovative&#8212;in Committee I quoted the wise words, as ever, of Kermit the Frog who said, or sang or croaked, &#8220;It&#8217;s not easy being green&#8221;. That is true. It is not easy, and this is an innovative and effective piece of public policy, and I praise the former coalition Government for introducing it.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.0/1">Is one benefit of the Green Investment Bank that in large part it addressed some of the market failure that had gone before? We risk losing some of the benefits that it brought in terms of securing green investment. All that will happen&#8212;an unforeseen consequence, perhaps&#8212;is that taxpayers will have to pay more through a larger subsidy.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.2/1">I praise my hon. Friend for tabling this new clause, and for the way that he scrutinised the Bill in Committee. Does he agree that things have moved on substantially since we met in Committee, with the Government&#8217;s publication last Thursday of the prospectus and the announcement that the sale was to proceed and will be a two-stage auction? It certainly looks as though the bank will be fully privatised, so all the debate and discussion that we had in Committee about whether the Government would keep a minority share in the bank, as recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee, seems to have been pretty much for the birds. The Minister probably knew that in Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on her election to the Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee. I am sure she will be as assiduous in scrutinising this proposal and other areas of Government policy as she was in Committee and on the Back Benches, along with my other hon. Friends. She is right to say that the publication of the Government&#8217;s intentions last week was interesting, and I hope that the Minister will answer her point about the Government&#8217;s intentions, and clarify whether they intend to maintain a stake in the Green Investment Bank after privatisation. When we probed the Minister on that in Committee, answer came there none. From the way that the proposals have been published, it would appear that the Government intend to fully privatise the bank, even though&#8212;as we discussed in Committee&#8212;it must be the worst possible time, given the current state of the market, to consider privatising this important public asset, if part of the purpose is to get good value for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.146.2/1">My hon. Friend will understand that I am not going to speculate on that, given that it is not current party policy or under discussion. What I will say is that the Government have a duty, if they go ahead with a privatisation that we do not support, to be absolutely sure they get value for money for the taxpayer, as well as to give an absolute guarantee that they will protect the bank&#8217;s green purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/2">I have praised the Government for the introduction of the Green Investment Bank, but why would they do anything to place its central green mission in grave doubt? I remind the House that the bank was first proposed under the previous Labour Government. It was first mentioned as a proposal for development by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, in one of his Budgets. It was developed in the Cabinet Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills when I was a Minister in those Departments. It was introduced under the coalition Government, and it has made a good start. It has been able to participate in the financing of projects that would otherwise not have taken place and that make a real contribution to meeting our commitments under the Climate Change Act 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/3">I think we all agree, throughout the House, that the creation of the bank is a good news story. I do not see any dissent from that proposition from anyone in the Chamber. We have therefore come to a strange pass when even something we all agree is a good thing&#8212;good borrowing for sustainable purposes&#8212;is classified as bad for no other reason than that it appears on the Government&#8217;s books.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/4">During the difficult years following the banking crash, in which we were sometimes in recession, a significant part of the UK economy&#8217;s growth came from the green economy. By some estimates, it accounts for 1 million jobs in the low-carbon sector and is worth more than &#163;100 billion. It is disappointing that the Government are in danger, if they are not careful, of undermining one of the key drivers of that sector. If we could tap into our country&#8217;s wind, wave and tidal power, we could create thousands more high-quality, sustainable jobs for our economy as well as doing the right thing for the environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/5">When the Government announced their privatisation plans last June, the Secretary of State assured the House in a written statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/6">&#8220;This should bring a number of important benefits, giving GIB greater freedom to operate across a wider range of green sectors in accordance with its green purposes, which are enshrined in legislation.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2015-06-25.27"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2015; Vol. 597, c. 27WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/7">He emphasised that the green purposes of the GIB were protected by the legislation in which its duty to pursue them are enshrined. After that, something obviously went wrong with the Government&#8217;s proposals. They received advice from the ONS that led them to say instead that they intended to repeal the very legislative protection that the Secretary of State had prayed in aid on <phrase class="date" code="2015-06-25">25 June 2015</phrase> when he announced the decision to privatise the bank. By October, they were effectively saying that it did not really matter whether they repealed the statutory protection, as long as they made sure the bank did not appear on their books. In his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2016-10-15">15 October</phrase>, when he announced his intention to repeal the relevant measures in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, the Secretary of State offered no assurance that the bank&#8217;s green purposes would definitely be maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/8">We have been demanding assurances on how we can ensure that the bank maintains its green purpose when it is privatised and does not simply become yet another bank&#8212;albeit a very small bank, but one that could easily be gobbled up by somebody else in the marketplace. That is why Labour and other parties defeated the Government on this issue in the other place and introduced the special share that we are trying to reintroduce in new clause 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/9">The Government say that the GIB can create the special share itself. In Committee, the Minister quoted a letter from the chairman of the bank, Lord Smith, to Lord Mandelson and Lord Teverson. She may well quote it again today; we will find out in a moment. In Committee, she said that she was confident that that approach would satisfy the ONS, but could not give us a guarantee. As I said then, we need an absolute assurance on that before we relinquish the legislative opportunity to future-proof the purposes of the GIB.</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/10">Since Committee stage, the bank has written to hon. Members, as is its right, outlining its plan to issue the special share envisaged in new clause 4 itself, rather than through the Bill, which is what we are proposing. Its reason for doing that is its belief that the ONS will then allow it to be classified as off the Government&#8217;s books. I asked the GIB whether it could guarantee that. Colin Faulkner, its director of government affairs, responded to me by email, writing:</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/11">&#8220;You&#8217;ll likely be aware that ONS doesn&#8217;t engage directly with arms length bodies like GIB. At the same time, however, we have been engaging closely with the Government over all matters relating to the sales process, and this is an issue where we&#8217;ve been as close as we can to Government throughout. We understand that Government has been engaging closely with ONS on this whole issue, including the special share structure which GIB is putting in place, and we understand that on the basis of those discussions the Government were sufficiently satisfied to allow the sales process to proceed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.146.2/12">On that basis, if the Government say they are satisfied, they should be able to guarantee categorically, here on the Floor of the House, that their special share proposal will definitely be acceptable to the ONS. I hope the Minister will say that. If she wants to intervene and say that now, she can, but I hope she will at least be able to say it in her response. She is not indicating that she wishes to intervene.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.3/1">I agree. My hon. Friend has been dogged in her pursuit of that both in Committee and in tabling her amendments on Report, and I look forward to her contribution on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/2">Will the Minister guarantee that privatisation will not dilute the bank&#8217;s green purposes, or must we just keep our fingers crossed? The Government still need to adequately answer questions that were not answered properly in Committee. Am I right that the legislative lock on the green purposes is being repealed purely to get the bank off the Government&#8217;s books? If that is the principal reason, is it a good enough reason to give up the statutory guarantee, given what I said about the technical nature of the accounting issue that the ONS raised?</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/3">Will the Minister indicate the Government&#8217;s view of the stake they expect to retain in the bank, if any, following privatisation? I understand that it is a market transaction, but we need an idea of the kind of return they expect from the sale. As was mentioned earlier, market conditions are so poor that the Chancellor had to abandon the sell-off of Lloyds shares, but we need to know whether they really expect a significant return from the privatisation, given all the pain associated with the process and the record of poor value for money for the taxpayer in previous privatisations. I do not expect her to be able to be precise, but she will want to avoid the criticism the Government encountered over the lack of value achieved previously, so will she gives us an idea of what she expects the Government to get from privatisation?</p>
	<p pid="a.148.3/4">Is the Minister concerned that these matters will provide further uncertainty for low-carbon investors, at a time of real concern about the Government&#8217;s retreat from investment in wind power? We have learned over many years that making policy in haste is not wise&#8212;it is certainly not wise to privatise in haste&#8212;and we might well repent at leisure if this innovative and effective piece of public policy is lost as a result of a lack of care and a rush to privatise. That is no way to make sustainable policy, particularly in an area where we are trying to create a sustainable future for the country, which is why we have tabled new clause 4.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.0/4">&#8220;Whilst we recognise there are potential benefits resulting from an injection of capital, we found that the Government has taken the decision to privatise GIB without due transparency, publication of relevant evidence, consultation, or proper consideration of alternatives. The absence of these steps is likely to lead to the suspicion that the move and its timing are not evidence-based policy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/5">Nothing has changed my view since December. The Government are again acting without looking at the evidence. My new clause is therefore intended to ensure that the bank is maintained as a single functioning institution that can continue to invest in the UK&#8217;s low-carbon economy at the level planned prior to this deeply regrettable privatisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/6">As well as being regrettable, the privatisation will not be easy. The Government say they aim to sell 75% of the bank, which equates to roughly &#163;1.5 billion up front, which is a considerable sum. Indeed, it is huge, even by the standards of the behemoth investment funds. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, one of the largest successful green energy sales in 2015 was worth just $688 million. Given that few notable deals even touched the &#163;1 billion mark in 2015, how can the Government be sure of making a sale of &#163;1.5 billion in one round? There is a risk that it will turn out to be fanciful.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/7">In addition, investor confidence in the UK&#8217;s green economy is at an all-time low. One need only look at last week&#8217;s Energy and Climate Change Committee investor confidence report to see that. In that context, it is even more unlikely that the Government will sell a majority stake in the bank in one round or that the taxpayer will get value for money on any sale. Furthermore, any equity stake bought would require the buyer to follow through on their equity annually&#8212;in other words, to bankroll the bank&#8217;s annual business plan&#8212;which would mean another &#163;500 million to &#163;600 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/8">The huge sums involved make it highly likely that come October, the desired 75% will not have been sold. Given the Government&#8217;s determination to hold on to only a 25% stake, if that, there is a good chance of the Government saying that they have done what they can but not been able to make the sale, and therefore proceeding to dismantle the bank and sell off its assets. In other words, we could essentially face a fire sale. That is even more likely given that the most attractive parts of the bank are ripe for asset sell-off, particularly the &#163;1 billion offshore wind fund and the &#163;500 million waste to energy fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/9">Furthermore, there is a risk of the bank&#8217;s owners&#8212;the new ones and the Government&#8212;not committing to fully funding the bank&#8217;s business plan for new investments in the UK&#8217;s green economy. It would then become little more than a fund manager, as opposed to a bank driving additional investment in the UK&#8217;s green economy. It is really important that the Government do not just sell to any investor. New investors must be committed to maintaining the bank as a going concern, fully funding its business plan, driving the expansion of the UK&#8217;s low-carbon economy, addressing market failure to crowd in additional private investment, implementing best-in-class governance, transparency and public accountability standards and facilitating and scaling up citizen investment in the UK&#8217;s low-carbon economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.0/10">Quite simply, my new clause is intended to inoculate the bank against the risks that I have described by committing the Government to maintaining its integrity as a single functioning institution with a fully funded business plan, not simply selling off its assets.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.1/1">Unfortunately, the special share has no legal underpinning, so we cannot have reassurance about that. In addition, the Government&#8217;s overestimation of the ease with which they will sell the bank is a real problem, as I am demonstrating. They have massively overestimated the speed at which they can sell, which I fear will lead to a temptation to asset-strip. My new clause is a simple way of ensuring that that does not happen. I suggest we ensure that anyone buying the bank commits to the full five-year life of round one.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention and kind words, and I congratulate her on her chairmanship of the Environmental Audit Committee. I do indeed share her concern that we have no real legal guarantee that this special share mechanism will be safe over time. We need a guarantee that it will protect not just the bank&#8217;s green purposes but the focus on complex and novel investments that a public green investment bank is uniquely fitted to be able to fulfil.</p>

If the Government are so sure that that is possible, I hope they will accept the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.151.1/1">I shall speak to amendment 17, which stands in my name and that of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10202" name="Caroline Flint">the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>. Before I come on to the substance, I would like to congratulate previous speakers in the debate. The fact that the Government have moved substantially on some of these issues is a testament to the scrutiny provided by the Environmental Audit Committee and the Labour party as the Bill has passed through the House. I put on record my anxiety about the fact that this asset sale was rushed out last Thursday, before the Bill had had a chance to pass through the House, which suggests that we are moving on the basis of a timetable not dictated by the Minister or the market conditions that would achieve the best possible value for a Government asset of this kind, but driven by the Chancellor, who is going to have make some difficult announcements in his Budget on <phrase class="date" code="2016-03-16">16 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/2">To meet the climate change targets that were agreed at Paris, we will need billions of pounds of green investment to upgrade the energy and transport infrastructure of the UK. So far, the Green Investment Bank has done a really sterling job in attracting capital to low-carbon infrastructure projects in the UK that might otherwise have struggled to find funding. The Bill allows the Government to sell off the bank. I stress that I am pretty certain that this bank is going to be sold in one piece at one time, with the risk that it will not achieve best value for the taxpayer. I am not opposed to privatisation, if it can be shown that it is the right policy tool to get the job done, but this decision seems to have been rushed through just to get the bank off the Government&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/3">The Environmental Audit Committee, on which <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24910" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> and I both sit, produced a report before Christmas that concluded that the Government took</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/4">&#8220;the decision to privatise GIB without due transparency &#8230;consultation, or proper consideration of alternatives.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/5">Ministers have simply not yet proven to Parliament that the bank will achieve its aims better in the private sector. The Government have relied heavily on assurances from potential shareholders and executives who stand to benefit personally from the sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/6">Amendment 17 would ensure that, if the sale goes ahead, the Green Investment Bank would remain accountable to Parliament and taxpayers by reporting annually on the pay of its top team. The Environmental Audit Committee recommended that the Government undertake proper consultation and evidence gathering before any sale and that protecting the GIB&#8217;s green identity should be paramount. While I welcome the Secretary of State&#8217;s pledge to protect the bank&#8217;s green status with a special share, as the Committee recommended, I am concerned that without locking that in legislation, it may not be secure. I am concerned that the special share will not be worth the paper it is written on in any future sale of the bank and that it will be forgotten because, of course, the bank&#8217;s onward sale value is depressed if we are limiting the nature of the activities in which it can invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/7">When the bank was established, it was intended by the Government to be an exemplar of transparency in the financial services sector in reporting executive pay. That particularly important point was accepted on a cross-party basis, given the recent banking scandal and the low levels of public trust in bankers and their bonus culture, which rewarded recklessness and persists to this day. It is therefore disappointing that that welcome clarity will not continue under the Minister&#8217;s proposals to privatise the bank. Ministers are happy for the bank and its executives to revert to the status of any other bank or fund with minimal reporting of remuneration that is limited to the highest paid member of staff and the chairman of the board. My amendment would commit the Government to providing full disclosure to Parliament of the remuneration of the Green Investment Bank&#8217;s senior management and board after privatisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/8">This point was hotly disputed and argued by the Minister in Committee, but it is fair to say that the Committee saw a certain irony in her stout defence of allowing Green Investment Bank executives to have the freedoms to increase their pay under the Bill and privatisation, although the Bill simultaneously caps the pay of people working in private sector companies such as Magnox with salaries of around &#163;25,000. That stands in sharp contrast to the salaries of the executive team at the Green Investment Bank, which range&#8212;we know this because of the transparency&#8212;from &#163;125,000 to &#163;325,000, plus bonuses and benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.1/9">The bank began in 2012 to invest in green infrastructure projects. It has invested in 58 projects with a total value of more than &#163;10 billion. Last June, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10753" name="Kevin Brennan">the Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> said, the Government announced their decision to privatise the Green Investment Bank. The Bill provides the means to do so by reclassifying it as a private sector organisation so that its finance will not contribute to public sector net debt, and by removing reference to the GIB&#8217;s green purposes and identity from the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.1/1">That has indeed been the argument from Ministers. We want the bank to be able to fund more projects, and the hon. Gentleman might say that the Government have called this privatisation a &#8220;natural next step&#8221;. However, who else supports the move? The Green Investment Bank certainly supports it, and the Government have drawn on that support as a primary motivation for their plans to proceed, but we have not had the same transparency and consultation that accompanied the bank&#8217;s establishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/2">The Environmental Audit Committee heard in evidence to our inquiry that the Government&#8217;s decision was taken</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/3">&#8220;without due transparency, publication of relevant evidence, consultation, and proper consideration of alternatives.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/4">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there are many different ways to raise money. When the GIB was established in 2013, the idea of privatisation so soon after its creation was not discussed. Our Committee also heard that the Government have not presented enough evidence for privatisation, or considered a wide enough range of alternatives to a sell-off.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/5">In their response to the EAC report, the Government claimed that they had undertaken unpublished market testing over the course of two years. In Committee, I asked the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise whether she would be willing to publish that market testing. She declined, and said that she would not publish the impact assessment either, because there were no regulatory or significant cost impacts of the GIB sale or changes to its pre-existing policy goals. Our Committee disputes that because of the risk to the green purposes of the bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.1/6">What concerns us is that a bank that was set up to invest in green projects is being privatised without consultation or transparency, and that, although it might have more money, it may not retain its laser focus on green purposes following any future sale. We know that when assets are sold&#8212;transport assets, for instance&#8212;they tend to be sold on by the pension fund or the other establishment that ends up holding them, hence my question to the Minister.</p>

Any change to the bank&#8217;s original purposes will have to come back to Parliament one way or another.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.1/1">The Minister has said that a report will be presented to Parliament before the bank is finally sold. In Committee, I asked her how the report would be considered by Parliament. I asked if it would it be considered on the Committee corridor as part of statutory instrument proceedings and if it would be subject to the affirmative or negative procedure. Will we have a chance to vote on this issue again? The Minister is nodding, so I am sure that she will clarify the position when she responds to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/2">The Committee had a series of concerns, and I still worry that the bank might be sold on at some future stage as the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Investment Bank. Investment banks are going through a very tricky time, and things are not at all well in their sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/3">Any purchaser of the GIB will be looking for maximum freedoms so that potential future sale capital receipts can be maximised.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/4">The only robust consultation that the Government can point to, given that they will not publish the market testing and have not carried out an impact assessment, is consultation with the bank itself. They relied heavily on the bank and its executives in evidence and their response in Committee and, of course, those executives stand to benefit from the sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.1/5">Amendment 17 invites the Government to commit themselves to providing Parliament with information on the remuneration of the bank&#8217;s senior management and board after privatisation. That information is currently provided in the bank&#8217;s annual report. For instance, how much will the executive team who are in charge of the bank stand to gain personally from the privatisation? How objective can their views be if they are to gain personally from the bank&#8217;s privatisation?</p>

The pay of my constituents and those of the hon. Gentleman has been eroded and depressed over the past year as a direct result of the actions of reckless bankers. Given that, and given the journey on which we have travelled in the past 10 years, it would be negligent of us to privatise a fully owned state bank without introducing protections to prevent the huge increase in remuneration that tends to take place when state assets are privatised.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.2/1">May I develop my arguments? I shall be happy to take further questions a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/2">Following a discussion with my colleagues in the Environmental Audit Committee last week, I wrote to Lord Smith of Kelvin, the chair of the Green Investment Bank, asking for clarification of the proposed remuneration for the bank&#8217;s senior executives. Our shareholders&#8212;taxpayers&#8212;could potentially remain as minority shareholders in the enterprise. I think that as long as the UK taxpayer has even a 1% shareholding in the bank, that should be carried forward. Taxpayers have committed &#163;3.8 billion to the bank, and rather than talking about what a future owner will put into it, let us wait until we see the colour of that future owner&#8217;s money.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/3">In that letter, I made it clear that the Environmental Audit Committee could see no reason for increasing remuneration as a result of a change in the bank&#8217;s status. We were particularly interested to know the proposed structure both of the management fee that the privatised bank would charge investors, and of any form of profit share or participation rights for management proposed in the offering to new shareholders. We wanted to know the board&#8217;s view regarding the quantum and structure of executive profit share incentives. We also sought an assurance from the board and management of their commitment to maintaining the staffing levels that the public purse has funded, to ensure that the bank continues fully and effectively to serve the UK&#8217;s needs for investment in green infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/4">Lord Smith&#8217;s reply to me reassured the Committee that the proposed business plan</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/5">&#8220;will require the current staff complement with possibly a small number of additions.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/6">That was reassuring, but less welcome was his response that the information memorandum for investors, which includes projected revenues and costs, including staff costs&#8212;this therefore has already been decided and written at board level, and had probably been decided and written when the Minister was in Committee with us&#8212;is commercially confidential and cannot be shared.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.3/1">The hon. Lady has special knowledge in this regard, so may I tease out some information from her? She mentioned the &#163;3.8 billion of public money that had been invested at a time of public expenditure reductions in certain areas. What consideration did her Committee give to what valuation would be appropriate when the Government sold the bank? She rightly said that it had constituted an inspiring start by the coalition Government, and that she wanted it to be an exemplar. Do the Government not have a special responsibility to ensure that they let it go into the private sector at the right time?</p>

	<p pid="a.155.4/1">The Committee&#8217;s remit was not to second-guess what the Government could or could not get for the bank. I am sure that there are people in the City who are much better able to do that than I am, and I am sure that some Members, certainly Conservative Members, could make a good stab at it.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.4/2">When I worked with small businesses, it was possible to get multiples of income, but that depends on what is being bought. In this case, what is being bought is an asset book with, it is to be hoped, future revenues from the investments that have been made&#8212;as well as what might be described as senior bank management intellectual capital&#8212;but what is also being bought is &#163;3.8 billion of Government investment in green projects from which the purchaser will hope to gain revenue and capital streams as, at some point, they are sold off. The situation will also depend on what the purchaser will put into capital projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">May I make a point about the issue of longevity? There is plainly a public interest in the bank&#8217;s remaining a green investment bank because of the amount of public money that has already been invested, and because of public interest in the development of green fuels and energy. That, together with the work that the Committee will do in scrutinising the bank&#8217;s future, surely provides enough protection to ensure that it will indeed remain a green investment bank.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.3/1">Once the bank is sold, my Committee will have no locus in scrutinising what it does. We could look into it only as a matter of interest. This is the final legislative opportunity that we have collectively as parliamentarians to say what we want to happen to the bank. We might have a chance to discuss it further if the matter is debated upstairs in Committee, but the process is now at its penultimate stage. The starting gun has been fired; the first round of the bidding process has already started. If the Government decide that they want to sell 100% of the bank by, say, September or Christmas, the Environmental Audit Committee could look into whether best value had been achieved, but only as a matter of interest. However, we want to test the proposals on the special share today to ensure that the public interest is protected, as the hon. Gentleman says, and that the green vehicle can continue to move forward. The Green Investment Bank is a really important financial institution for enabling us to meet our climate change targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.3/2">The Chancellor said in January that the sale of shares in Lloyds would be postponed because of market turbulence. The sell-off was scheduled for the spring, but he has now said that it will come after Easter. We shall wait and see when that happens. Since the start of the year, we have seen a bear market, great turbulence in the financial markets, panic selling of crude oil, and oil prices at a 13-year low. These are worrying times for the global economy and the market is hugely volatile. All bank shares are currently falling in price, whether they are UK bank shares, European bank shares or US bank shares. Just this morning, we have heard that the Bank of England has announced it will give commercial banks three exceptional opportunities just before and after the EU referendum to borrow as much as they like to offset any threat of a run on banks and to prevent a repeat of the chaos of the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. In the light of that bleak, turbulent and choppy financial picture, we have to ask whether the Government&#8217;s decision to launch the sale of the bank last Thursday was the right one. Whatever one&#8217;s views on privatisation, this hardly seems to be the most auspicious time to sell off a state asset, let alone a state-owned bank.</p>

	<p pid="a.157.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11898" name="Mary Creagh">the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)</phrase>, who chairs the Environmental Audit Committee, on her speech. I wholly agree with what she has said. I also congratulate her and her Committee on all the work that they have done to tease out the details of this sale.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/2">In 2012, the Green Investment Bank was set up for a purpose. It was stated quite clearly that its purpose was to address specific market failures and investment barriers in a way that would achieve emission reductions at the lowest cost to taxpayers and consumers. It was going to achieve that by working within the framework of the Climate Change Act 2008 and by risk-sharing between the public and private sectors, identifying and addressing market failures and limiting private investment in low carbon infrastructure, thereby accelerating and delivering green investment on a large scale and with significantly lower capital costs. That was the whole point. The bank was set up precisely because there was a market failure. The private sector was not able to achieve this. It is not just me, an Opposition Member of Parliament, who is saying that. Labour supported the bank. Indeed, it was our idea in the first place when we were in government, and we were delighted when the coalition put it into place.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/3">The coalition Government also set up the Green Investment Bank commission. It was an independent, non-partisan advisory group brought together by the Chancellor himself. It took three years and two official rounds of rigorous market testing and evidence gathering to establish that a green investment bank was needed. The commission collected evidence to inform the bank&#8217;s aims, its design and the operating model under which it would function. Let us compare the three years and two official rounds of market testing it took to set the bank up with the sudden shock decision to sell it off, which was taken with a complete lack of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/4">What did the commission find? It found that without a way of directly addressing market failure and risk-sharing between the public and private sectors through a green investment bank, higher levels of direct subsidy would be required to facilitate low carbon investment. That would mean higher costs to the consumer and the taxpayer. That is what the Chancellor&#8217;s own commission, with the hand-picked people he put on it, agreed. That rationale is now being undermined by this sale. Let us be absolutely clear that, according to the Government&#8217;s own commission, this sale will result in an increased cost to the consumer and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/5">The Chancellor has given himself something of a problem. By committing to achieve a public finance surplus every year in normal economic times, the Government have ruled out borrowing to fund public infrastructure. The exception is investments through the private finance initiative, which do not affect the headline public finance numbers. Since the financial crisis, there has been less private finance available to invest in either public-private or private infrastructure projects. At the same time, direct public investment has also decreased.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/6">One of the concerns expressed by investors relates to the political risks that have manifested themselves as a result of potential changes in Government policies. Those changes have already been criticised and I will not go into them again today. However, the way in which the Government have chopped and changed the regulatory framework for low carbon investment has resulted in a decline in the UK&#8217;s attractiveness for investment, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24910" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> has commented from the Green Benches. According to the Ernst and Young rubric, we fell out of the top 10 best places for investment for the first time last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/7">The way in which this issue has been tackled by the Chancellor has been twofold. The Pensions Infrastructure Platform has sourced less than &#163;1 billion in total over its first four years of operation, despite its aim being &#163;20 billion. Furthermore, instead of the projected &#163;40 billion from the UK guarantees scheme, only &#163;1.7 billion in guarantees was actually issued in the first two years. Let us contrast that dire financial performance with the performance of the Green Investment Bank. Having been set up with just &#163;2.3 billion of public money, it has mobilised more than &#163;10 billion of investment in British infrastructure in the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/8">Actually, I wish the bank had had a few more failures. It adopted a very specific policy at the beginning, which was to go for safe projects. It went for those projects because it wanted to build up a track record of successful investment so that, at about this point, it could attract much more private sector capital and take on riskier projects. That is the point of a green investment bank. The point is not to do what the market is going to do anyway by investing in areas that will obviously attract a return on capital. The whole point of the Green Investment Bank was to take on those much more difficult technical projects that the market would not finance.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/9">Three years in, we have reached precisely the point at which we should be thinking, &#8220;Great! The bank has a successful track record behind it. Now it needs to move into slightly riskier projects.&#8221; Some of those projects might have failed&#8212;that is the nature of banking and investment&#8212;but the overall balance of investment flowing into UK infrastructure would have been hugely enhanced. So what do the Government decide to do just at the point of lift-off of the Chancellor&#8217;s only successful lever to get money into infrastructure projects in this country, the performance of the other two having been quite dismal? They pull the plug. They throw it away&#8212;send it off into the private sector, the very place that could not manage this market failure in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24907" name="Bob Stewart">The hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> said earlier that the bank is a success so why can it not go on being a success in the private sector? That was the question that had to be posed by the Green Investment</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/11">Bank commission in the first place and the question that the bank was set up to answer. The former chair of the bank, Bob Wigley, pithily provided the best response to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question when he said that there was an &#8220;inherent tension&#8221; between the GIB&#8217;s continuing to invest in novel, more complex projects that are profitable over the long term and shareholder pressure to maximise short-term returns on high-value investments, given the focus on quarterly performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.157.0/12">There you have it. There is a tension in the private sector. It is one that we all recognise. It is well-known. It is one that the Governor of the Bank of England has spoken about at great length over the past year. He called it the &#8220;tragedy of the horizon.&#8221; The investment horizon is so short that investors cannot see the payback in these sorts of projects. It is tragic that Government are privatising&#8212;neutering&#8212;one of the best things that they have established.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">It has been an interesting debate, but I must confess that I do not agree with many of the arguments advanced by the Opposition, so I hope that hon. Members will not support any of the new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">If I may deal with things in reverse order, I will first address new clause 8, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24910" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase>, which seeks to ensure that the Green Investment Bank continues its green investments plans post-privatisation. We agree on what we want the bank to continue to do. We are seeking bidders who can fund the GIB&#8217;s legally binding commitments and who have the deep pockets to fund its ambitious green business plan. The bank&#8217;s management is clear that it needs access to private capital to fund its green business plan. That could be equity capital raised as part of the sale process, debt capital, which the GIB can raise when it is in the private sector, or private capital raised as part of a fund structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">Business plans change and evolve as new opportunities arise, and we will not bind new owners into the current plan, so I cannot accept the hon. Lady&#8217;s new clause. The new owners of the GIB will have views on the future strategy and business plan. They will assess it as part of their due diligence and make it a part of their offers. Whoever the new owner or owners are, the special share ensures that the business plan, like the GIB, will continue to be green.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">It must be said in response to many of the points and arguments that it is almost impossible to understand why anybody would want to buy the Green Investment Bank&#8212;the clue is in the name&#8212;unless they wanted to ensure that it continued to invest in green projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.5/1">I disagree with the hon. Lady, because the privatisation and sale of the Green Investment Bank is about ensuring that more money is available from the private sector to carry out that particular sort of investment. Forgive me, but it really is not the role of Government to gamble and make investments with taxpayers&#8217; money. That was right in 2012 when, as mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10220" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase>, the Green Investment Bank was set up because of an accepted market failure. However, the idea that the Government are throwing it away, as he put it, could not be further from the truth. The Green Investment Bank is a real success story. No one is seeking to pretend that it is anything else. We want its success to continue, but in the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his excellent intervention, which I wholeheartedly endorse. We have always said the Green Investment Bank would stay green after privatisation. Green investment is what it does, as its management have made clear. We have explained that the only reason we are repealing the green protections from legislation is to allow the GIB to move to the private sector, by removing state control over the bank. However, we understand the concerns raised by hon Members and noble Lords, and we have found a device to protect the GIB&#8217;s green purposes without legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.2/2">I am very grateful to Lord Smith of Kelvin, who, as has been mentioned, has written to Opposition Members in the other place explaining the view of those currently in charge&#8212;I shall put it in that way&#8212;of the GIB about this special measure and why they absolutely have all confidence in it actually achieving what we all want to achieve. This is the device that cures the mischief.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24880" name="Mark Pawsey">the Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey)</phrase>, to all Members of this House. I hope all hon. Members, on both sides, have had the opportunity to read it, because it could not be clearer about why what the Government have proposed will ensure and protect those green purposes, and why legislation in this area is absolutely not necessary. One reason why we do not want the Opposition&#8217;s new clause 4 to be successful and to put this provision into legislation is that we feel the Office for National Statistics will take the view that what we seek to do will not be achieved in this way&#8212;the bank will not be off the books&#8212;and that is why it is so important that this is done in the way we propose.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.1/1">This is a short answer&#8212;yes. The hon. Lady will have seen this letter and I hope she will have read it&#8212;upside down, inside out, backwards and everything else. It is well over two pages long and it could not be clearer as to the way the special share is going to be set up. I shall rely on the fact that it talks about the special shareholder and how difficult it would be to undo this device. That could be done only with the permission, in effect, of the special shareholder. This House can therefore be sure that this is the right way to achieve what we all want to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/2">That is why it is important to pay tribute&#8212;some may say that this is a first, and indeed it may not be the last&#8212;to the Scottish Government and to the Scottish National party. I have seen the letter John Swinney has written on behalf of the Scottish Government, quite properly as he is the Deputy First Minister and has responsibility in Scotland for finance, the constitution and the economy. He, too, rightly and understandably, has raised his concerns about how we best protect the green credentials of the GIB. As a result, he, too, has contacted Lord Smith, and letters have been sent back and forth. In short, to the credit of the SNP, it takes the view&#8212;I will be corrected if I am wrong&#8212;that this device, which is up and running, with the work already having been started by the GIB to secure this special shareholding, means that everybody can be confident that this is the way to secure what we all want, but without the need for legislation, which could completely scupper this privatisation and selling off of the GIB.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">The Minister has said on many occasions that she is confident that introducing the special share in this way will work. Our case all along has been that we would like to hear her say to the House that she can guarantee, rather than just be &#8220;confident&#8221;, that the ONS will approve this approach. Can she now say, in terms, on the Floor of the House and on the record, that she can guarantee that?</p>

	<p pid="a.162.3/1">I hope I am being parliamentary when I say that the hon. Gentleman is being a bit of a minx&#8212;I mean that in the nicest way.<i> [Interruption.]</i> He quite likes that, which is good, although I do not think he will like the next bit. I have already explained in Committee that we cannot give that guarantee, and he was a bit naughty, calling the ONS a bunch of boffins. I think he rather regretted it because the people in the ONS are not that; they are absolutely independent of government and will rightly come to their own conclusions. We are confident that if the measure goes into legislation, the ONS will not take this bank off the books, because it will not be properly in the private sector. If, however, we do it in the way that we are all suggesting&#8212;I include the chairman of the GIB in that&#8212;there is every chance in the world that this will then become a successful privatisation. It is confusing to work out what people&#8217;s real views are; <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11898" name="Mary Creagh">the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)</phrase> says that she does not object to the GIB being sold off, although she has raised her concerns. She is in favour of it in principle, but it is not certain whether others are.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/2">Let me now deal with amendment 17, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10202" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Wakefield and the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>. Again, we firmly believe it is not required. The GIB is currently required to report to higher standards&#8212;the standards for quoted companies&#8212;which include the level of detail required by this amendment. That is appropriate because it is currently entirely publicly owned. Post-privatisation, there is no reason why the GIB should be singled out to report on its remuneration to Parliament, especially if it is not spending any public money. It is a matter for the board of a company and its shareholders to agree remuneration policy. I note that there was an exchange of letters between the hon. Lady and the GIB&#8217;s chair, Lord Smith, where she asked about future remuneration policy, and I am sure her Committee will publish the letter in full. If the Government retain a minority stake in the GIB&#8212;we have made it clear that our intention is to sell a majority of it&#8212;we could express views on this and other aspects of corporate policy. We could agree with other shareholders what level of reporting might be appropriate on this and other matters, but we do not consider that this matter should reside within legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/3">As I said, the GIB has been a terrifically successful venture. It is important to understand that it was set up in 2012 because of a market failure. Opposition Members certainly do not like to reminded of the perilous financial situation our country faced in 2010, and it certainly was not all the fault of the banks&#8212;it was also a pitiful failing of Government policy at the time. What the GIB has done is help investors in the market to better understand the risks of green investment, and this comes back to the point being advanced by the hon. Member for Brent North. We know that, since 2012, long-term debt markets have significantly improved, which suggests an improvement in market conditions. Frankly, we would not set up the Green Investment Bank today, because those market failures no longer exist. The Green Investment Bank has proved that an organisation can be green and profitable, and its success demonstrates that the market can deliver green, which must be a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/4">I have dealt with the point about the Office for National Statistics, so I will not repeat myself. The hon. Members for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan) and for Wakefield asked whether the Government will retain a minority stake in the Green Investment Bank. I have to say that our position has not changed since the Committee stage. I explained then that we intend to sell a majority of the Green Investment Bank. We may retain a minority, but we cannot commit to that. Our report to Parliament makes it clear that decisions on the size of stake in the Green Investment Bank to be sold will depend on the outcome of confidential commercial discussions with investors.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/5">I pay tribute to the Secretary of State for his announcement last week that the Green Investment Bank is now available to be sold. Unfortunately, I can say no more than that, other than that we are confident that this sale will be successful and will be done at the time when the market is in the right place. Having said that, we will not sell the bank unless of course we know that we will get the right price. For some time now, we have had strong market interest in the Green Investment Bank, which has strong underlying assets that are less exposed to market volatility. The large infrastructure sales that have recently been made, such as that of City airport, have also been very successful, and that gives us confidence in this part of the markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/6">Nobody&#8212;not even Scottish National party Members&#8212;has asked this question, but if they were to, it would be a good question, so I will pre-empt it and say that one reason why the Green Investment Bank has been so successful is that it has been primarily based in Edinburgh, which is an excellent place in which to do business, especially as it is still within a United Kingdom. I can see no good reason&#8212;again, this is something that we explored in Committee&#8212;why the Green Investment Bank would want to move away from Edinburgh. Why on earth would it? <i>[Interruption.] </i>If <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25400" name="Callum McCaig">the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Callum McCaig)</phrase> wants to intervene, I am happy to give way. <i>[Interruption.] </i>No, he has changed his mind. That is probably because I reminded him about the price of oil, so we will move swiftly on.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/7">The hon. Member for Cardiff West asked me whether the Government can guarantee that the Green Investment Bank will be off the balance sheet. I think that I have dealt with that. I said that we cannot give a cast iron guarantee about the ONS, but we have confidence, and I hope that that confidence will be shared by the whole House.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/8">We do not need this new clause, because of the assurances that have been given by the noble Lord Smith in his extensive letter to all Members of the House. In that letter, he goes into quite considerable detail about the mechanisms that he is already putting in place to ensure the future green credentials of the Green Investment Bank. That is why we say that this new clause, which will be tested, should be resisted.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/9"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10202" name="Caroline Flint">The hon. Member for Wakefield and the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> have quite rightly raised their concerns about the Green Investment Bank and tabled amendment 17. When the bank is sold, it will be a private sector company&#8212;this is an important point to put on the record&#8212;and, as such, it will be subject to normal company law. For a company the size of the Green Investment Bank, which is unquoted&#8212;that means that it is not listed on the stock exchange&#8212;the minimum requirement will be to report aggregate information in relation to total remuneration and specific information relating to the highest paid director. As I have said, it is currently required to report to higher standards&#8212;the standards for quoted companies&#8212;which include the level of detail required by this amendment. That is appropriate because it is currently entirely publicly owned.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/10">I have given considerable praise to the Green Investment Bank<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i> I have just been handed a note, which will doubtless be a blessing to everybody who, in due course, has the great good fortune either to read this in <i>Hansard </i>or to be following these proceedings. I will, if I may, pay tribute again to the bank and to all those who work for it, especially the chairman, the noble Lord Smith.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/11">In conclusion&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Cut it out<i>.</i> I certainly shall not forget the heckling of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10354" name="Chris Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/12">The Government have listened&#8212;that is the most important point&#8212;to the concerns of hon. Members and noble Lords of all parties. We have been open and transparent about our intentions for the Green Investment Bank not only since June of this year, but as far back as the autumn statement in 2013 when we made our position clear. We want what is best for the Green Investment Bank, which is to increase its green impact with greater access to private sector capital. As Lord Smith said in his letter, he wants us to do it our way, and not the Opposition&#8217;s way, so that it has the access to equity that it so badly needs. We need to give it the freedom to continue doing what it does best, so I hope that all hon. Members will join me in the No Lobby to resist the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.4/1">I am happy to confirm that the Opposition will be supporting amendment 18, tabled by the Scottish National party, which we discussed in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/2">This is the bit of the Enterprise Bill that has nothing to do with enterprise; it is largely about spin, to be perfectly honest. Let me make it clear, as I did in Committee, that Her Majesty&#8217;s official Opposition agree that excessive exit payments in the public sector should not be paid, and that any abuses in that regard should be ended. The problem with the Government&#8217;s approach is that they are attempting to govern by headline in a very complex area, and in so doing they are creating the sorts of anomalies and unfairnesses that I am sure we will hear about during this debate. Including a headline-grabbing figure&#8212;in this case &#163;95,000&#8212;on the face of the Bill is, frankly, the worst kind of utterly vacuous government, and it is exactly the sort of rigid legislating that good civil servants advise against, and that bad Ministers promote.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/3">The inclusion of that figure in the Bill is really about allowing the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills to have his tabloid headline about fat cats, which was one of the odious remarks he made on Second Reading. That was an insult to thousands of decent, hard-working people across this country, many of whom have never been paid anywhere near &#163;30,000 a year, let alone the &#163;3 million a year that the Secretary of State used to get when he worked for an investment bank. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> That has a lot to do with it, because of the language he used.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/4">If I was to accuse the Secretary of State of being a fat cat&#8212;I am not going to do that, Madam Deputy Speaker&#8212;the Minister would be huffing and puffing in her usual way, muttering &#8220;Outrageous&#8221; and &#8220;Disgraceful&#8221; from a sedentary position. She and the Secretary of State like to dish it out, but they do not like to take it when it comes back their way. She was quite content to sit there on Second Reading and cheer the Secretary of State on as he traduced public servants, including long-serving local librarians and even privatised nuclear decommissioning workers, and described them as fat cats. I wonder how they felt about the Secretary of State using that language. Actually, I know exactly how they felt, because they wrote to us in their droves to express their anger at his insulting rhetoric, and that evidence&#8212;there was a lot of it&#8212;was officially submitted to the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.4/5">Amendment 15, tabled by the Opposition, seeks to protect those workers who earn less than &#163;27,000 a year from the proposed exit payments cap&#8212;yes, those who earn less than &#163;27,000 a year are the Secretary of State&#8217;s so-called fat cats.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.0/1">I was present on Second Reading when the Secretary of State described long-serving public servants on low and average pay as fat cats. At the end of that debate, the Minister said at the Dispatch Box that the exit payments cap would not apply to civil servants earning less than &#163;27,000. I hope that she will forgive us if we do not take her word for it, and that she will therefore accept our amendment today to ensure that the promise is in law.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.1/1">There was a time when what Ministers said on the Floor of the House could be accepted, and I am prepared to accept that the Minister is sincere in what she has said. In fact, I am not sure that she said quite what my hon. Friend says she said. I think that she actually said that it could affect a small number of people on &#163;25,000. However, I think that my hon. Friend is echoing what one of the Minister&#8217;s Treasury colleagues had said earlier. If I am not mistaken, the current Minister for Employment, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24778" name="Priti Patel">the right hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase>, when referring to what would be in the Conservative party&#8217;s manifesto, said that the proposal would not affect anybody earning less than &#163;27,000 a year. We have therefore taken her words, given as a promise from a Minister of the Crown, and put them into an amendment in order to hold the Government to their word. The fact that this Minister was not prepared to repeat that in those terms when she spoke on Second Reading can perhaps be explained by the Government&#8217;s refusal to support our very reasonable amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.171.0/1">Following the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s deliberations in Committee, and from his own analysis&#8212;obviously we are looking in the round at public expenditure on exit payments&#8212;can he advise the House on what proportion of that expenditure in, say, the last five years was for people earning less than &#163;27,000, and what proportion was for people earning over &#163;100,000?</p>

I am afraid we have not been able to elicit a great deal of information from them on that subject, other than that they think it would be rare for those people to be affected.

	<p pid="a.171.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. In the absence of data, he has his good judgment and his reasonableness, following his many years in Government before 2010.

	<p pid="a.171.3/1">That is what the Government say the target is. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I respect him greatly for his independence of mind and thought, and for his intellect on these matters. As I said at the outset, if abuses are going on in relation to public sector exit payments, we are perfectly willing to say they should be stopped, but we need to look at what the clause actually does. It picks the figure of &#163;95,000 to generate a headline saying that the Bill will stop fat-cat public sector exit payments of more than &#163;100,000. However, what it does not elucidate very well is that that &#163;95,000 is not just a cash lump sum, but includes the so-called strain payments that are paid into workers&#8217; pension funds when they are forced into redundancy before retirement age. That is money they will never get in their pockets&#8212;they are not walking away with &#163;95,000. They are not fat cats earning more than &#163;100,000, and some are on relatively modest incomes. The Bill will also capture many people in the private sector, which the Government were also not keen to elucidate on.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Clearly, large numbers of public sector workers, who have often given long service, might have to take redundancy&#8212;not surprisingly at a time of severe cuts in, for example, local government. The provisions in the local government pension fund require those strain payments to be made, and those will count towards the &#163;95,000 exit payment.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.3/1">Did the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise not take the Committee through a number of worked examples demonstrating that the Bill would not have the adverse effect on pensions that is suggested? For example, a prison officer earning &#163;28,000 a year with 34 years&#8217; experience could still retire at as young as 52 without being affected. Does that not illustrate that the hon.

	<p pid="a.172.4/1">I recommend that the hon. Gentleman read more deeply into the report of the Committee stage. I commend to him the worked example I gave of somebody on a salary of &#163;25,000 who had given long service in local government and who would be affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.4/2">Obviously, the right hon. Member for Witham did not think at the time that these people were fat cats; she thought they should be protected, and we need to understand why that is not happening in the Bill. Why was a lower earnings floor not included, given that the Conservatives promised they would pursue only&#8212;again, I quote from their manifesto&#8212;the &#8220;best paid&#8221; workers? Of course, once the election was over, the Government ignored that.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.4/3">Problems emerged because the consultation was so poorly conducted, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24818" name="Catherine McKinnell">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> said. Usually, a full consultation takes 12 weeks; the Government did this consultation over four weeks in the summer&#8212;it began on <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-31">31 July 2015</phrase> and concluded on <phrase class="date" code="2016-08-27">27 August</phrase>. If the Government were serious in their rhetoric that the Bill would affect only the best paid, it would be very straightforward to include a provision to exclude those on &#163;27,000 or less. In fact, what the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise said on Second Reading, which was alluded to earlier, was:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.4/4">&#8220;What we do know is that there is a very small number of workers&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.4/5">that is the figure she gave&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.172.4/6">&#8220;in the public sector on about &#163;25,000 who could be caught by this&#8230;But those are extremely rare conditions.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2016-02-02.886"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 February 2016; Vol. 605, c. 886</phrase>.]</p>

The rhetoric used by the Government is shameful; the contemptuous, short nature of the consultation is shameful; and the way in which the policy has been introduced overall can only be described as shameful.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/2">We are concerned about the Government&#8217;s reluctance to make the necessary exemptions to ensure that the unfortunate few&#8212;that is what the Government tell us they are: a few&#8212;are not disproportionately affected. If the low paid and average paid are affected only in rare circumstances, excluding them from the cap will not result in the Government losing a great deal of money, so what is the problem in exempting them?</p>

	<p pid="a.173.2/1">I am listening intently to the hon. Gentleman. I was in the Committee, and I am wondering whether there may be a flaw in his argument&#8212;no pun intended. If we put the floor in at &#163;27,000, what about the person at &#163;28,000? How would we distinguish between the different groups? Is it not better to set a limit to the payment that is made and to be blind on the income that someone gets up to that limit?</p>

	<p pid="a.173.3/1">I understand the point the hon. Gentleman is making. That would be all right if it was truly a payment that people were going to get in their pocket. The reason these people are captured, however, is that the figure includes the so-called strain payments that are made into the pension fund if they are made redundant before their normal retirement age. That is the unfairness, and that is the reason why, I presume, that the former Treasury Minister said that no one on under &#163;27,000 should be affected. The Opposition have simply taken what the Government originally said their intention was, as elucidated by a Minister of Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury, and put it in our amendment to test why the Government are not acting on what was said.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">On Report in the Lords, Baroness Neville-Rolfe indicated that a drop of &#163;500 would not be disproportionate for someone previously entitled to a pension of &#163;12,500&#8212;the implication is that there could be a fall in the pension paid ultimately. All I would say is that a 4% drop in income for somebody on a relatively small income&#8212;it is lower, after all, than what one would receive on the minimum wage&#8212;would be highly significant on that low income. To say that a 4% cut is not significant is hugely out of touch with the reality of many people&#8217;s lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/3">The Government&#8217;s case is that a leaving payment of &#163;95,000 or above is a large amount for any employee, but they are perpetrating the myth that people will actually receive that money. Employees on low to average incomes will never see a large amount, because the payment includes compensation paid to the pension scheme. In fact, some of them will never even receive their pension, so they will never see that money in any way, shape or form.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/4">The cap includes strain payments, and the pension shortfall is adjusted at the time of redundancy. Strain payments could make up a considerable amount of the &#163;95,000. If so, long-serving, loyal workers could finish work with a significant shortfall in the amount that should have been allocated to them to deal with redundancy, unemployment and uncertainty. They will be left with little in their redundancy payment to pay for annuities to provide long-term security. I do not think that was the Government&#8217;s original intention, but the fact that they have refused to respond to the concern makes me wonder whether I am right about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/5">We have been told that the Chancellor has withdrawn his pensions proposals, which would have raised &#163;10 billion to pay down the deficit. In other words, he has moved swiftly so as not to offend better-off pensioners who might have been hit by the proposals. Why, then, will the Government not turn their hand to those who earn less than &#163;27,000 a year, whose redundancy and access to a pension are threatened by the exit payment cap? The Chancellor has famously said that we are all in this together and that those with the broadest shoulders should bear the biggest burden, so the Government have a chance to prove that by supporting our amendment 15, which is, after all, based on their own words.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/6">Amendment 16 would exclude from the provision employees of the companies listed in new schedule 1, which are operated by the private sector. Those who would be affected are principally employees of companies across the nuclear estate and elsewhere in the private sector, such as Magnox. Why are they affected by a measure that the Secretary of State told us on Second Reading is designed to hit &#8220;public sector fat cats&#8221;? According to the Secretary of State, Magnox workers who work in the private sector are &#8220;public sector fat cats&#8221;.</p>

She is absolutely right. The employees of these companies would never have imagined for one second that they would be hit by the Government&#8217;s proposals and the Conservative manifesto commitment to cap public sector exit payments. We raised the issue in Committee, but the Minister refused to guarantee that they would be excluded from the exit payment cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.0/2">The companies listed are in a unique position. They are mostly engaged in managing the safe closure of nuclear facilities, which is a task of huge national importance. By its very nature, it involves working towards a specific end date, at which point the employees will effectively make themselves redundant, provided that they have done a good job. That is what they are doing: they are working to make themselves redundant.</p>

	<p pid="a.175.3/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s argument is powerful, and I am genuinely at a loss as to why the Government do not take heed of it. The proposal will not only cost individuals in the long term; it is also a betrayal of trust and will only benefit, to a small degree, the company involved. It will not actually benefit the Government, so I do not understand why they do not take action to right what is clearly a wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">Exactly. The Treasury&#8217;s justification is that, even though the companies have been privatised, the workers are still deemed by the Office for National Statistics to be on the Treasury books, because of the nature of their work. It is understandable that their work needs to be underwritten by Government, because they are decommissioning nuclear sites and no one can get an insurance policy for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2">That technical, statistical designation, however, does not mean that applying the cap to those workers is fair or that it necessarily represents value for money for taxpayers in the long term. There is no proof that taxpayers will receive any benefit, as the private operators of the companies often receive higher incentive payments in their contracts as a result of this kind of change. Unless the Government decide to act, employees in the sector will note that the Treasury has excluded them from the public sector when it comes to pension provision and other issues, but considers them within the scope of the capped exit payments.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.6/1">What the hon. Gentleman may not realise is that the workers of the banks that have been taken into public ownership will be specifically excluded from the exit payments cap under the Government&#8217;s plans. That might change his mind, so he might like to join us in the Lobby later. Yet again, it seems to be &#8220;Up with the bankers and down with the workers&#8221;. What a shocking value-free zone this policy is, if the Government stick to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/2">We have received strong representations on the matter from Magnox workers, from trade unions including Unite and Prospect, and directly from the workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/3">The bodies that we have included in new schedule 1, which are affected by the &#8220;public sector fat cat&#8221; policy, are Sellafield Ltd, Westinghouse Springfields Fuels Ltd, Magnox Ltd, the National Nuclear Laboratory, International Nuclear Services, Atomic Weapons Establishment Ltd, Low Level Waste Repository Ltd, Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd, RSRL Winfrith and RSRL Harwell. I note that none of the companies in that list is called &#8220;Fat Cats Ltd&#8221;, but they are all included on the list of companies with workers that the Government are, by their own admission, treating as fat cats.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/4">The Public Bill Committee received dozens of letters from Magnox workers, and I congratulate them on the quality of the representations that they made. I quoted in Committee from a letter from one of the workers, and I will quote it briefly again. Ian Milligan, who works at Bradwell as a waste engineer, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/5">&#8220;I should like to start with a definition quoted from the Oxford English Dictionary, the dictionary that has sat on my desk for the duration of my career within the Nuclear Industry which has spanned over 20 years. The question I had was, what does the term a fat cat infer? The answer: A Fat Cat&#8212;a wealthy person, a highly paid executive or official.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/6">He goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.176.6/7">&#8220;I, and many of my work colleagues employed by Magnox Ltd, are likely to be &#8216;caught&#8217; in the proposed Exit Payment Cap of the Enterprise Bill, to which I, and my work mates across the board were shocked to discover, as we are ordinary working class people and do not consider ourselves to be Fat Cats by any stretch of the imagination.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.177.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I know that it is difficult to believe&#8212;presumably, that is why the hon. Gentleman had to check before making his intervention&#8212;but the Secretary of State actually said that the measure was intended to hit fat cats in the public sector, which therefore includes everybody affected by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/2">This confirms the understandable anger that is out there. My hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n might add examples of workers from his constituency. Agreements have been made and guarantees have been given. We were told that the provision was to hit public sector fat cats, not employees in the private sector. We have tabled the new schedule, which would exempt the companies listed from the Bill. If the Minister has another way of doing it, as I said to her in Committee, I would be interested to hear it. In Committee she was not able to offer any comfort whatever to the workers of the companies listed in new schedule 1. Her response was disappointing, given the weight of evidence submitted to the Committee and the strength of feeling among hon. Members and their constituents. Workers have made their plans and taken life decisions on the basis of promises that were made to them. As far as we can surmise from the limited information that the Minister is prepared to provide about the Government&#8217;s intentions, the Government are going to take action that will affect those workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/3">In Committee, the Minister rehearsed arguments about all sorts of scares that may have been put about by mythical people whom she was not prepared to name, but going by the evidence submitted to us, the workers in question will be affected to quite a large extent. We represented the workers&#8217; arguments in Committee and made their case on their behalf, but all we got from the Minister was a response to issues that had not been raised in the workers&#8217; letters or, indeed, by us, and a vague reference to secondary legislation at some later date that will name some as yet unknown entities that may be excluded from the cap. In other words, all we got was an empty sheet of paper. I am afraid that that is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/4">We in the House need to know what the Government&#8217;s intentions are, and we need to be able to tell constituents who have written to us, and who are directly affected, whether they will be hit by the exit payment cap. Those hard-working people are the definition of strivers. They are the beating heart of this country. Their letters reveal that they are not swivel-eyed lefty loonies or fat cats but ordinary working people, many whom live in the constituencies of Conservative Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/5">Ministers have put things in the Bill that are meant to get them a headline in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Sun</i>. That is fundamentally why the proposal is so flawed. The reality, when we lift the stone and look underneath, is that it will affect all sorts of people whom the Government did not indicate that they intended to hit. Hard-working people are being betrayed by their Government. They would have made very different assumptions about what this policy meant when they read the <i>Daily Mail</i> headline or even the Conservative party manifesto. That is why, if the Government will not stand up for those workers, we will.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.0/1">I am pleased to follow the shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10753" name="Kevin Brennan">the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase>. I have constituents who work at the Atomic Weapons Establishment in Aldermaston, at the Defence Science Technology Laboratories in Porton Down and elsewhere, so I have an enormously high regard for those extraordinary public servants who contribute so much to the security of our country. I therefore have some sympathy with new schedule 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/2">It is easy for the newspapers to produce graphic headlines such as &#8220;Civil service pen-pushers get massive pay-offs&#8221;, but I am talking about slightly different people. They are not ordinary people in the sense the shadow Minister was talking about; they are really rather special. They work at the forefront of technology to ensure that the nation remains safe and that our realm remains secure. I know from talking to my constituents that people at the AWE, which has been privatised, are very unhappy indeed. The AWE is a unique and important facility. It is the only place capable of designing and producing the successor to our Trident nuclear missile system, and indeed of maintaining Trident until its successor comes into force. I am told that morale at the AWE is at rock bottom. To remove the last major benefit of working there&#8212;pay has been historically low because of the decent benefits&#8212;risks the nuclear deterrent, in some people&#8217;s opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/3">These people are not the only ones to be affected. A constituent of mine who works at DSTL came to see me at my surgery on Saturday. He is a leading scientist, and he brought with him examples of ceramic armour that he had personally developed for the protection of our troops. I do not know how many Members in the Chamber have been to see any of our defence science laboratories. I represent Farnborough, the home of the former Royal Aircraft Establishment, which is now the headquarters of QinetiQ. I have met some of its employees, who used to work in some pretty shabby conditions&#8212;no wall-to-wall carpeting, rubber plants or anything of the sort&#8212;although they have rather fine offices now in Farnborough, and I have been struck by the fact that they could get a lot more money in the private sector. When I asked them, &#8220;Why do you work here?&#8221; they replied, &#8220;Because we want to give something back to our country.&#8221; Those scientists show an extraordinary sense of patriotism, dedication and loyal commitment to our country; in my view, they contribute disproportionately to the defence of the realm.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/4">My constituent told me on Saturday that for decades he had been</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/5">&#8220;Paying my taxes&#8230;Saving hard&#8230;Avoiding debt&#8230;Obeying the law&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/6">and, of course, &#8220;Working hard&#8221; to develop these life-saving technologies for members of our armed forces. He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/7">&#8220;in spite of this&#8230;I have received below inflation pay rises since 2004&#8230;My pension contributions have doubled&#8230;My retirement age has increased from 60 to 67...My redundancy terms &amp; conditions have been degraded significantly&#8230;My pay is now 20% lower than MOD colleagues outside of Dstl&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/8">He drew my attention to the 2015 review of the MOD&#8217;s science and technology capability by Sir Mark Walport, the Government&#8217;s chief scientific adviser, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/9">&#8220;We understand that staff retention is difficult in the mid-career stage. We were surprised that Dstl are able to retain staff (let alone good staff) given the comparative low-pay offered.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/10">Conditions have not improved owing to the austerity measures that we have had to take, which I understand, but that did not stop the chief executive of DSTL receiving a 30% remuneration increase. In those circumstances, it is understandable that these people do not feel that they have been treated as well as they should have been. The other point about them is that, as Crown servants and the kind of people they are, they do not go around protesting; they come to our surgeries or write us a private letter. They will not write to the national newspapers or stand outside with a placard, because they just want to get on with their jobs. I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that there is a risk that we may be taking for granted people whose contribution to our national security is, as I said, rather significant.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Instinctively, I am entirely sympathetic to his argument, which applies to not just Crown employees, but those in the security services. However, could not his argument about such concerns easily be made about everyone working in the public sector? That is why the Government&#8217;s instinctive view is against drawing the distinction that he would like to make.</p>

Friend and I understand his point, but the place I represent is the home of the British Army, as well as the birthplace of British aviation, and it is steeped in technology. I know these people&#8212;I did so when I was a Defence Minister, as I have throughout my constituency experience in Aldershot&#8212;and I value them. I am afraid that I think they are rather special and that they have been neglected. I have specifically pointed out that their grades have not been made up to MOD grades, because they are busy in their laboratories doing what they like doing&#8212;inventing and helping to protect us all&#8212;so I will not resile from singling them out. My hon. Friend is entirely right to say that I am doing so, but I hope he will accept my apology for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.4/2">Earlier today, I had a meeting with officials from Prospect. They acknowledge that one of our manifesto commitments was to</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/3">&#8220;end taxpayer-funded six-figure payoffs for the best paid public sector workers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/4">They accept that the Government have a mandate for that, but it is worth putting what they say on record&#8212;forgive me for doing so, Mr Deputy Speaker&#8212;because they feel that the Government did backtrack on the agreement signed in 2010. They use the word &#8220;renege&#8221;, but let me say &#8220;backtrack&#8221;. They say:</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/5">&#8220;The current civil service redundancy terms were agreed by Prospect and other civil service unions and the last Minister for the Cabinet Office&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/6">our noble Friend Lord Maude&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/7">&#8220;just four years before the Conservative party&#8217;s announcement that it would seek to renege on that agreement. The minister stated at the time: &#8216;what the new scheme shows is that constructive negotiations with the unions can work and the result is a package that is fair for civil servants and fair for other taxpayers&#8217;. He also said: &#8216;I believe we now have a scheme which is fair, protects those who need the most support, addresses the inequities in the current system and is right for the long term.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/8">I put it to my right hon. Friend the Minister that, despite the use of the phrase</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/9">&#8220;right for the long term&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.180.4/10">the scheme has not lasted more than six years. I will not vote against the Government today, but I urge her to have a discussion with the Treasury to determine whether this matter can be looked at again, because it is not fair on some of our most dedicated scientists who, as I say, are working to keep us secure.</p>

	<p pid="a.181.0/1">I rise to speak to amendment 18, which is in my name and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25409" name="Hannah Bardell">the Member for Livingston (Hannah Bardell)</phrase>. The amendment perfectly complements amendment 15, which would add specific protections to part 9. As <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10753" name="Kevin Brennan">the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> said, as it stands, and given the rhetoric accompanying it, part 9 is a classic populist move by the Tory Government. They are playing up to the perception of fat cats, saying that people get huge pay-outs that are not comparable with private industry pay-outs, but they are not taking account of long-serving, lower-paid workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/2">As I have implied, there is a lot of smoke and mirrors behind this scheme. The &#163;95,000 cap includes pension payments that go not to the workers, but to the pension funds, including in the form of strain contributions for those on ill-health retirement. It is absolutely amoral that somebody who has to retire on the grounds of ill health, having worked hard, perhaps in a manual job, will have their pension capped because of this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/3">I really do not understand how the Government cannot recognise the impact of the scheme. It was interesting that the House of Lords asked for an impact assessment, but it was not forthcoming. Back Benchers have asked the shadow Minister about the impact, but it is not for Opposition Members to provide that; it is the Government&#8217;s responsibility to do so at the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/4">The Government have admitted that this provision could affect workers who earn less than &#163;25,000, which includes librarians, midwives, NHS workers and other long-serving employees. Those people are worlds away from the horror stories that we sometimes read about failed chief executives who walk away with massive lump sums. I understand a curb on pay-outs for those people. Even worse, some people receive a massive pay-out and then pop up in another council as a highly paid consultant. Again, I agree that there should be cap on that. I also suggest that the situation I have outlined is more of a problem in England, given that Scotland has only 32 local authorities, but I understand the concept of trying to control that.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/5">The sum of &#163;95,000 is a lot of money but, to put it in perspective, it is only three and a half years of an average salary, and a pay-out potentially puts someone out of the marketplace for good. We already know that many women who have previously taken early retirement are now suffering financially because they were not informed about the increase in the state pension age.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/6">Those women are now being forced into work programmes, but they are struggling to get back into work, which illustrates how difficult it can be to get back into work at a certain age. We should not be imposing exit caps that affect life choices for lower-paid workers who are trying to weigh up their options, given their realisation that they will have to work much longer than they had planned or been notified about by the DWP.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/7">This provision will also hit middle-income earners, who are not meant to be the target. The local authority that I belonged to periodically operated a teacher refresh scheme to allow older, more experienced teachers to be considered for early retirement and replaced by younger teachers. That represents a virtuous circle of creating vacancies for young teachers, protecting the pensions of retiring teachers, and saving the taxpayer money overall due to the lower wages that are paid to new starts. Good governance is needed, not an exit cap that, in its current format, is too much of a blunt instrument.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.0/8">Given the forced austerity that has been imposed on us, the Scottish Government have implemented a policy of no compulsory redundancies. In Scotland there have been zero compulsory redundancies in the NHS, but in England there have been more than 17,000 since 2010. If the Government really want to play the popularity game, as the hon. Member for Cardiff West said, they should extend this measure to other publicly supported companies, such as those banks with public money behind them. It beggars belief that we have a Chancellor who will stick up for annual bankers&#8217; bonuses against the rest of Europe, but is happy to stand back on important matters such as exit payments and to let lower-paid workers suffer.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.0/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the Scottish Government&#8217;s record on avoiding compulsory redundancies. In my previous experience as the leader of one of Scotland&#8217;s biggest councils, we could not have managed the substantial reduction in our workforce without compulsory redundancies if we had not had the flexibility to offer severance packages that were proportionate to the service that people had delivered. Without that ability, councils in Scotland would have faced large numbers of compulsory redundancies that would have been inhumane in our workforce.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.1/1">I agree with that fine point completely. I went through the same experience as a local councillor on East Ayrshire Council. Although some of the payments made would be caught up by this payment cap, they were demonstrated to be value for money because of the payback period of two years. We were able to show good value for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/2">The Minister for Employment originally pledged to protect workers earning less than &#163;27,000. Amendment 15 would allow that protection to be put in place, while amendment 18 would allow the cap to reviewed and increased in line with inflation. As the Bill stands, that cap is another part of the ongoing erosion of terms and conditions, given that inflation levels and the cost of living is clearly going to rise. The measures allow the Government to maintain a charade of being a party for workers. That is why we will push amendment 18 to a vote, and hopefully the party of workers on the Government Benches will support us.</p>

	<p pid="a.184.3/1">It is very confusing.

That is what is being said by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituents and my constituents who have been writing in.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.3/2">The Minister could end the confusion today.

	<p pid="a.184.4/1">Government amendments 3 to 9 will enable Welsh Ministers to make regulations on exit payments that they feel are suitable and devolved to them through the Government of Wales Act 2006. That has been agreed with Welsh Ministers through the Welsh Assembly, and I am grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.4/2">The Conservative manifesto was very clear that we would introduce the cap and that we would set it at &#163;95,000. It is extremely important to remember that this relates to redundancy pay. The cap will curb only the top end of exit payments&#8212;just the top 5% in value of all exit packages across the public sector. Amendment 15 is merely a device based on an article in <i>The</i><i>Daily Telegraph</i> written by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24778" name="Priti Patel">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase> back in January 2015. It was not part of the manifesto promise that was made. There is no honour, if I may say, in putting that forward as anything other than a junior Treasury Minister praying it in aid in an article she wrote in <i>The</i><i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.4/3">I want to make it absolutely clear that the cap will not affect a classroom teacher earning the maximum of the upper pay range of &#163;38,000 with a normal pension age of 60. It will not affect anyone working in the NHS earning below &#163;47,500 or firefighters. I am told that police officers cannot be made redundant, and in any event no police officer earning below &#163;54,000 would be caught by the cap. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that no civil servant earning below &#163;25,000 will be captured. Some earning around &#163;25,000 may be captured, but we can find no such example. A librarian earning &#163;25,000 with 34 years&#8217; experience could still retire on an unreduced pension at the age of 55.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.4/4">We also think it unlikely that anyone earning less than &#163;27,000 would be hit by the cap. It is important that we remember that it is extremely rare in the private sector for anyone on a wage of &#163;25,000 to expect, on redundancy, a payment of &#163;95,000&#8212;nearly four times their annual earnings. Having said all that, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24787" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, made one of the most important points: it is right that we look at the value of the cap, as opposed to the salary or income someone is earning when they leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.4/5">Finally, I want to address the important points about new schedule 1 and ask hon. Members not to support it. I listened with great care to the excellent points made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10293" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth)</phrase>&#8212;I pay tribute to the workers he mentioned&#8212;and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11148" name="Albert Owen">the hon. Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen)</phrase>. I must make it absolutely clear, however, that we oppose the new schedule because we think it wrong to put the exemptions in the Bill. The relaxation provisions allow for special circumstances but only after proper ministerial scrutiny. I can assure them that I will continue to speak to right hon. and hon. Friends in the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.4/6">I agree with the helpful and wise interventions from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10884" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase>, and I hear the points hon.

	<p pid="a.197.6/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/2">I thank the Leader of the House for the time allocated for this debate, which I hope will be as full as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/3">There are many areas in which inequality still exists for women. This debate will range, I hope, across complex and varied parts of our society and across the world. In the run-up to International Women&#8217;s Day, I have engaged with many colleagues across the House and in the other place, talking about the importance of this day and the issues facing women at home and abroad, and I have discussed with many gentlemen the importance of International Men&#8217;s Day. Today&#8217;s debate will perhaps boil down to this question: in the age in which we cherish equality of opportunity, why do women not actually get the same chances as men, and what is this Parliament doing to see that happen here and around this wonderful planet of ours?</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/4">Women have the chance to run or lead a business, to contribute properly to their community, to influence the world around them, to be paid the same, to be treated the same, to speak in this cherished Chamber and to be heard. Women do not want to be under threat or in danger just from walking home alone, or because of the dangerous or threatening nature of our personal relationships, or because of our religion or perceived position in our community or society.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/5">On this day we have the opportunity to talk about and celebrate the achievements of women across the world, but also on this day we must highlight all the inequalities that still exist. I have two daughters and I want to see them grow up in a society where their gender has no relevance to their opportunities and what they can achieve. Today is my second daughter&#8217;s birthday. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Happy birthday!&#8221;] She is six, and International Women&#8217;s Day has real meaning in my house. I hope she is a truly international woman in the making.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/6">There are invisible barriers to my daughters&#8217; futures and to those of other girls. Today I hope we will go some way to confronting them. Equality is about choice. It makes me very proud to know that here, in the mother of Parliaments, we can act as a beacon of equality for women across the world. Today sixth-form girls from across the country are joining us. They have taken part in a series of events throughout the day and I know that some are watching us now from the Public Gallery.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/7">As the chair of the all-party women in Parliament group, it fell to me and my team to make sure that we mark this day appropriately. We open Parliament today to students from across the UK. I want to thank my team and all those supporting me, including other MPs, for their help in making this important event happen, because almost 70 girls, from Aberavon to Ayrshire, and from Eastleigh to Ealing, have come here to be part of this day, to take this opportunity to contribute and to hear our democracy in action. I want to welcome two local students, in particular, from Barton Peveril Sixth-Form College and Eastleigh College.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/8">Yet it was only in this parliamentary Session that we finally got a Women and Equalities Select Committee, which looks at the key issues that this Parliament is involved in. I am very proud to serve on the Committee, under the brilliant chairmanship of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase>&#8212;her son also has a birthday today, so many happy returns to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/9">It is very easy today to think that the challenges of equality are in the past, but it took until 1995 for us to have the first woman chief constable, until 2009 for us to have the first woman poet laureate, and until 2011 for us to have the first woman commander of a Royal Navy warship. Of course, this country has been led by only one mighty female Prime Minister, and this House has been led by only one female Speaker. Rapid progress for women is absolutely not a subject for historical study; it is an urgent, continuing and pressing need now.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/10">In our panel debate earlier today we listened to students discussing whether successful women are still seen as pushy, bossy or tokens, and indeed whether we do not actually get the opportunities we want because it is just about confidence. Thinking about successful women, it is worth noting that one in seven chefs hired in Michelin-starred restaurants in London are women&#8212; I wonder what Mary Berry has to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/11">Are stay-at-home mums currently given the opportunity to make the choices that are right for them, or are they still being judged? I chose to stay at home and be with my children when they were very little, but I wonder whether I would still feel that that was a safe decision to make. Are we still judging our women? Are we really offering them answers to all these questions and allowing them to be part of the community in any way they choose? In order to get true parity, that is what we need to strive for.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/12">All too often it is these set-piece debates in the Chamber that draw the focus of political commentators, so we perhaps see women in only one way. The press will focus on the high politics of our nation, rather than the huge contribution that many people make every day. We need more women councillors, school governors, magistrates, mayors, MEPs, Assembly Members and police and crime commissioners. Often women step forward for those roles but move on too quickly. Why is that? Is it because women take on those roles to deal with single issues, or do they still see barriers to the top?</p>
	<p pid="a.197.6/13">In business, we need more women on boards and in senior roles. Of course, this Government have taken action to get more women into science, technology, engineering and maths and to get the next generation into leadership roles, but progress remains too slow. In 2013, 33% of local councillors in England were women, compared with 28% in 1997. We need to step up the pace.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">Exactly that issue was highlighted in our panel debate this afternoon. I absolutely agree that we need to encourage more women into this area. There are 40,000 jobs available in the construction industry, and 45,000 in the agricultural industry. We are perhaps barring women from future opportunities. It absolutely worries me that we have not changed since the 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">We in this House must be reminded that women&#8217;s power is at the ballot box. Women should be registered to vote, and we should make sure that all women feel it is important for them to make their own decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate from the Backbench Business Committee. Does she also welcome the Government&#8217;s action on outlawing revenge pornography, which for too long has blighted the lives of many women in this country?</p>

	<p pid="a.200.1/1">I absolutely concur. Just on Thursday, we had action on people posing behind aliases&#8212;the Crown Prosecution Service is carrying out a consultation on the issue&#8212;and using bullying and threatening behaviour on social media. It is absolutely right that the Government continue to lead the way in dealing with bullying, stalking and using personal relationships to affect people&#8217;s futures. We will be in a dangerous place if we do not tackle that.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/2">The Government&#8217;s recent announcement on the gender pay gap should continue to shine a light on those companies that do not do enough to ensure parity in their workforces. We need more women on company boards, and work on that continues. There has been a huge leap forward, but we can expect to wait for 70 years for full parity at executive level, and that is not right.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.3/1">On the Women and Equalities Committee, we are shining a light on that issue. On part-time work&#8212;I will touch on this shortly in my speech, which the right hon. Lady may have been reading&#8212;it is interesting that, when it comes to men, we talk about agile working, while women appear, sadly, to be the downtrodden part-timers in some places. That needs to be corrected.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.3/2">We need to put a better structure in place for our carers. I was a carer to my mother, and I am a mother myself. For many people in my shoes, there continue to be too many obstacles to being at home and a part-time worker. This country needs a true carers revolution that does not penalise women or, indeed, men who choose to stay at home with their children or to look after their loved ones. I spent time with my parents at that age, and I would never, ever change that, but I had the choice.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.1/1">I absolutely agree that flexible working is really important for people to be able to attend doctor&#8217;s appointments and to know what is going on at home without being worried about work. Many people who work part-time open their laptops of an evening to make sure that they are up to date, because they have had to go home to care for their children or loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/2">Part-time work is valuable. It is important and useful both to workers and to employers, yet part-timers are often seen as a stopgap. They are not taken seriously enough and are viewed as expendable employees. It is time to view part-timers as agile, capable multi-skillers who are flexible and come in and make a real difference. They look after families, homes and communities, and hold down equally important part-time roles. I challenge anyone in business who does not believe such workers to be as valuable and helpful and just as useful as their full-time members of staff. Perhaps it is time for such employers to reassess and listen harder to those vital and often more nimble workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/3">I want to make it clear that it is not my intention to exclude men from this debate. Many male colleagues will want to contribute their own ideas about how men, as fathers, grandfathers and proud dads of daughters, can make a more just and equal society. International Men&#8217;s Day on <phrase class="date" code="2016-11-19">19 November</phrase> highlighted some serious concerns about men&#8217;s mental health, male suicide and the modern pressures on men. This changing society will have a bigger impact if we do not bring men fully on this equality journey with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/4">I am the 380th women to be elected to Parliament. Women have not played anywhere near an equal role in the history of this House, but we are getting there. I welcome the fact that we are moving towards better representation both in this Chamber and in all the issues on which we focus. However, there is much left to be done. Madeleine Albright, the former US Secretary of State, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/5">&#8220;There&#8217;s a special place in hell for women who don&#8217;t help each other&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/6">Many hon. Ladies and hon. Gentlemen have come to the Chamber to mark this important day. There is a unified view in this House that our work can bring true equality on International Women&#8217;s Day. I am delighted to have wide and broad support from men.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.2/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for securing this debate. As well as women&#8217;s representation in this Parliament, we should also consider what happens around the world. For example, Benazir Bhutto was the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan&#8212;indeed, she was the first female Prime Minister is the Islamic world&#8212;and she lost her life to an act of terror as she returned democracy to her country. We should pay tribute to women around the world. By way of declaration, I served as an adviser to Benazir Bhutto from 1999 to 2007.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.1/5">I want to thank Karen Ingala Smith and the Counting Dead Women project. She does not allow these women to be forgotten; she shouts their names so we can do better. I want to note that as I read each and every woman&#8217;s story, the variety of the women struck me. These were not all poor women. They were women of every age. They were teachers, dinner ladies, doctors, dancers and daughters. Their perpetrators were not feckless drunks, but respected fathers, City bankers and eminent lawyers. Violence against women has no one face. We must do better. These women are gone. Here, in this place, we must not let them die in vain. We owe them that much. We owe them much more than what they got. <i>[Applause.]</i></p>

Friend because we are fellow members of the Women and Equalities Committee, and we have a shared passion for making sure that the voices of women are heard loud and clear in this House.

Everybody in this House who was involved, and those no longer in the House, should be congratulated on the work they did to establish the Committee, which I have the privilege of chairing. Today, we have turned the tables in the Committee: young women have taken evidence from Members of Parliament. I particularly welcome my constituent, Aheng Negargar. She has been able to be with me today, and I know she has enjoyed it immeasurably.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/3">Congratulations must go to my fellow Hampshire MP, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase>, and to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11447" name="Dawn Butler">the hon. Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler)</phrase>. Both ladies were a formidable force in front of the Backbench Business Committee. I had no doubt that they would secure a debate on the Floor of the House, and they did so at once. I should add that we thought about adding an extra criterion for being a member of the Women and Equalities Committee&#8212;having a child born on International Women&#8217;s Day. However, looking at the hon. Member for Hampstead and Kilburn</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/4">(Tulip Siddiq), who was a member of our Committee, I hope that she does not feel that it is necessary to give birth today, although I am sure many people would be on hand to help out.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/5">I will make two very brief points in my contribution today. As you know, Mr Speaker, there are more men in the House of Commons today than there are women who have ever been elected to Parliament. I was elected in 2005, as the 265th woman to be elected to this House, which is a shocking fact. I was not aware of that when I was elected. Since women were given the vote in this country in February 1918, 34 million women have been born, but just 450 have ever sat on the green Benches. No other position has been worse at attracting women than that of MP. How can we hope to change ingrained prejudice in our society if we fail to hold a mirror up to ourselves and realise that, as an institution, we are not making the progress that we need to make to encourage more women to take their position on the green Benches?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/6">It is not rocket science. Working in two places, a lack of certainty, a culture of long hours and presenteeism are not conditions that will encourage more women to join us on the green Benches. I ask Members to think long and hard when they consider the way that we organise the business of the House, and I ask them to make us more representative in the future and a place of work that people want to join.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/7">My second point is about leadership. I have no doubt about the Government&#8217;s commitment to putting equality at the heart of their policy, or their desire to see more women in leadership positions. The symbolic importance of Lord Davies&#8217;s work in getting 25% of women in non-executive positions is important, but we must go further than that. We have no shortfall in talent in this country; we have an underperformance of that talent because of ingrained prejudice.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/2">This debate takes place against the background of the recent murder of Berta C&#225;ceres, a feminist activist who was shot in her home in western Honduras because of her defence of the rights of indigenous people. I hope that many women will continue her work. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has said that when he took office there were nine Parliaments in the world without women. That figure is now down to four, but that is four too many, and there has still been no female UN Secretary-General. Hon. Members are right to mention the percentage of women in this Parliament, which now stands at 29%. Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition, the Labour party, has 43% female MPs, which is nearing equality.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.2/1">I will, and I am delighted that she was selected. However, the statistics are still damning. In law, one Supreme Court judge is a woman, and only 13% of QCs are women; in science, women make up only 14.4% of the science, technology, engineering and maths workforce in the UK; in business, only 5.5% of chief executive officers in FTSE 100 companies are women. What about the gender pay gap? In 2014, according to the Office for National Statistics, it was 14.2%, which means that in effect, women work from about <phrase class="date" code="2016-11-09">9 November</phrase> to the end of the year without any pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.2/2">I want to raise two issues about women in my constituency. Locally, there was an equal pay judgment in 2008, and the poor women who worked for Birmingham City Council are still waiting for a pay-out. The men who did the same sort of work picked up extra pay through routine overtime and other bonuses. Mary Ashby and Josephine Haynes are retired, and they have a right to their pay-out. The Government can find &#163;375 billion for quantitative easing, so will they please find the money to make sure that all the women get their pay-out?</p>

	<p pid="a.205.3/1">The hon. Lady makes a powerful point about women&#8217;s pay. According to the OECD, the Scandinavian countries of Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland score rank in where women are most equal. Those countries also lead the UN human development index and a number of other indicators. When women are doing well in a society, everybody does well. That helps the hon. Lady&#8217;s argument.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.4/1">I absolutely agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.4/2">The second issue I want to raise is the closure of Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs offices in Walsall South. Some 90% of the 60 jobs that will be lost are done by women. They have been offered jobs in Birmingham, but they have caring responsibilities, so they need to stay local. There is also the issue of higher travel costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.4/3">The Public and Commercial Services Union has worked out that when 50 jobs are lost, it costs a local economy &#163;1.5 million. That is too much for Walsall to take. If the Government are serious about tax evasion and tax avoidance, they need local staff who have the institutional memory to help people with their tax affairs. The staff build up the skills over the years, which helps them to get promotion through the civil service.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.1/1">Would my hon. Friend mind if I do not? I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/2">On Saturday morning, more than 500 people in Walsall town centre signed a petition to ask the Minister to look again at this dislocation of women&#8217;s lives and stop the relocation to Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/3">Internationally, there may have been a fantastic victory in Burma for the National League for Democracy, but the Burmese army has used rape and sexual violence against women for decades as part of its warfare against ethnic minority groups in the country. Many victims were gang-raped and many were killed, and United Nation reports have described rape and sexual violence as &#8220;widespread and systematic&#8221;. The Burmese army accounts for 25% of the Burmese Parliament. We must keep up the pressure to get rid of the army from the Parliament in Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/4">In Delhi, there was an outcry following the gang rape, assault and murder of Jyoti Singh on a bus. Leslee Udwin&#8217;s film &#8220;India&#8217;s Daughter&#8221; showed the devastating impact of Jyoti&#8217;s murder. Who can forget the late Sue Lloyd-Roberts&#8217; interview with the cleric from Gambia in which she challenged him about female genital mutilation, or the Nigerian girls who were kidnapped almost two years ago this April?</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/5">We need to do more than just have a hashtag, and that is where Governments come in. Almost every major piece of legislation that has improved the lives of working women has been introduced by a Labour Government: the Work and Families Act 2006, which extended the right to statutory maternity leave to a full year for all employed women, regardless of length of service; the introduction of paternity leave in 2003; and legislative protections for women and mothers under the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Equality Act 2010. Everybody knows how brilliant Sure Start centres are in helping local children, mothers and fathers in our communities. We need to save them.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/6">Education is the key. As Gandhi said, if we educate mothers we educate society. Women cannot wait for the trickle-up to promotion&#8212;there needs to be positive action. Marin Alsop, who in 2013 was the first female conductor of the last night of the Proms, admitted to being</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/7">&#8220;quite shocked that it can be 2013 and there can still be firsts for women&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/8">Let us hope that by this time next year, women&#8217;s place at the highest levels will be commonplace. We owe it to future generations.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.2/1">Last week, when I was in Nigeria, I had the honour of meeting a very small team of dedicated and passionate campaigners. On arrival at the hot, dusty open-air venue, I could hear them chanting and singing, and a lot of them were wearing red. Every day, this small group&#8212;mainly of women, but with some men&#8212;meet at Unity Fountain in Abuja. They campaign for the return of 276 girls taken by Boko Haram from their school on <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-14">14 April 2014</phrase>. Fifty-seven of the girls escaped shortly after their abduction, but 219 remain missing. These young girls from Chibok were just like our girls. They were daughters, they were granddaughters, they were sisters, they were cousins and they were nieces. They were loved. They had been encouraged to embrace education&#8212;and they had, and their families had&#8212;and they were preparing for their final school certificate. They had hopes, dreams and aspirations, and then disaster struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/2">Notwithstanding world condemnation and the support from Michelle Obama, our Prime Minister and others, the girls have not been returned. It is likely that many are still being held by Boko Haram, probably in smaller groups. Many will be pregnant as a result of rape, often by different men, over prolonged periods, and many will have been forced into marriage. Some will have been used as suicide bombers, and some will have died as a result of physical and mental abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.2/3">The Chibok girls are a small proportion of an estimated 2,500 women and girls abducted by Boko Haram in 2014. As they return, many face discrimination and rejection by their families and communities. Some fear that the girls have been radicalised. Others believe that the children conceived, carrying the violent characteristics of their biological fathers, will be the next generation of fighters. As a result, children, new-born babies and mothers are facing stigma and rejection, and risk further violence.</p>

As I stand in the Chamber today, I can still hear the chants of those Nigerian women, and I can still see their round and pained faces. They said, &#8220;Bring back our girls now and alive. Bring them back now.&#8221; Rarely have I witnessed such strength and determination.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/3">Now these brave, strong women need our support, as we approach the second anniversary of the girls&#8217; abduction.

We want people everywhere to write, email, and tweet #BBOG; and to hold rallies, vigils, talks and Google chats. We need Governments and agencies around the world to share credible evidence and intelligence, and we need to keep these innocent girls in our thoughts and prayers. Just one tweet or one post can make a difference and bring our girls home.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.0/1">I want to structure my speech around the motion, which starts by expressing solidarity with International Women&#8217;s Day, as I have done today by dressing in the suffragette colours&#8212;just one symbol of that solidarity. Underneath, I am wearing a Fawcett Society feminist T-shirt.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/2">The second part of the motion</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/3">&#8220;notes with concern that, despite women making up 51 per cent of society as a whole, more progress needs to be made in electing women to Parliament&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/4">Like you, Mr Speaker, I was a member of the Speaker&#8217;s Conference on representation in this place. We have made progress. I am proud of the Labour party, which still provides more than half the women in this place, for taking the decision, which was not an easy one within the party, to use women-only shortlists. I was originally called a &#8220;quota woman&#8221;, but everyone has forgotten that now because they realise that I am quite an effective Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/5">We need to go further. I welcome the new Conservative women to the House. In some ways, I am glad that they were beneficiaries of the collapse of the Liberal party which, in my view, has done less than any other party on this issue. Let us remind ourselves why it is so important to have women here. At the moment, democracy fails if people cannot hear their voices in Parliament. Do women make a difference? Absolutely, they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/6">I remember asking the Clerk of the Defence Committee at the turn of the century what difference having women on that Committee for the first time had made. I was not sure what the answer would be but, &#8220;Of course it has made an enormous difference, Fiona,&#8221; was what this rather stuffy Clerk said. I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, we just used to talk about how big the bombs were, but now we talk about the families of the people who fight.&#8221; I just know that what would make me brave is knowing that my family is safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/7">Women bring something additional to Parliament. One thing we achieved under a previous Prime Minister was the first ever stealth tax cut, when he could not bring himself to mention during his Budget that the level of VAT on sanitary protection had gone down. I am disappointed when we get patted on the head on some of these issues, in that the most recent san pro tax cut turned into a way of making this a kind of voluntary tax&#8212;&#8220;Guess what? We&#8217;ll give it to the Eve appeal.&#8221; I am glad that the Eve appeal is getting the money&#8212;I am a survivor of ovarian cancer myself&#8212;but if san pro is being taxed, the money should go into strategic support from the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">It is essential that we have a strategic response to violence against women and girls. We have all been moved by the speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase>, and we know that women&#8212;internationally and in the UK&#8212;are particularly likely to be victims of violence, which might be through so-called cultural practices such as FGM, or victims of human trafficking.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">I am glad that the Government have introduced the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and are focusing on the issue. We know that, internationally, the biggest reason for trafficking in human beings is trafficking for sexual exploitation. With women who are murdered, we know that if they have been in prostitution, their perpetrator is much less likely to be caught and convicted. Our average murder conviction rate is 75%, but at the moment we convict only 23% of the murderers of prostitutes. That is a shocking figure. We fail to have an intelligent, strategic response to the existence of prostitution, recognising that it is, as it is actually practised, a mechanism for violence towards women, for the sexual exploitation of children and for turning women into commodities, thus making all women&#8217;s lives less safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">I am glad that the Home Affairs Committee is looking at this issue, but until we follow Sweden&#8217;s lead by targeting the men who create this problem and saying that it is an offence to pay for women&#8217;s sexual services, I do not think we will end the horror that is the reality for most women and girls involved in prostitution&#8212;the horror of drug addiction; the horror of pimping; and the horror of exploitation and trafficking. That is something that we really need to focus on. When I first came to this House, we were reluctant to discuss the word &#8220;prostitution&#8221;, and I am glad that we now have a Chamber that is prepared to talk about it. However, we now have to do things to end this form of exploitation.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10402" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the right hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>. Let me also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/2">It was 20 years ago yesterday that I, as Women&#8217;s Minister, opened a debate on International Women&#8217;s Day that was taking place in Government time. I hope that Ministers will consider allowing a full day&#8217;s debate on this subject in Government time, because I think that that would be appreciated by Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/3">Twenty years ago, we had a lady Speaker&#8212;and very formidable she was&#8212;but only 60 MPs were female, and even today we have only 191. Although the percentage figures have increased, I think&#8212;as, I believe, do many other Members who are present today&#8212;that that is still not good enough. We are still not doing enough to inspire more women to take up political careers. That, of course, is little wonder, given that&#8212;notwithstanding what was said by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase>&#8212;the way in which our parliamentary system operates is viewed through the prism of Prime Minister&#8217;s Question Time which, on a good day, often seems little better than a primary school playgroup. Indeed, I have seen primary school playgroups whose behaviour has been better.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/4">On that occasion 20 years ago, I had recently returned from Beijing where, at a United Nations conference, a group of us had negotiated a platform for action. I was supported by Baroness Chalker and the then Member of Parliament for Tiverton and Honiton, Angela&#8212;now Baroness&#8212;Browning. More than 36,000 women attended that conference. I think that women&#8217;s lives have improved since then but, as I have just four minutes in which to speak, I can give only two brief examples of how.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/5">Back in the 1990s, the global average number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births was 338. The highest level was in sub-Saharan Africa, where it rose to an appalling 510. By 2015, the figure had fallen to 169. I welcome the fact that a further target of 70 has been set as part of the sustainable development agenda. Meanwhile, the percentage of women parliamentarians worldwide has doubled in those 20 years&#8212;from 11.3 in 1995 to 22.7 now.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/6">A crime that particularly affects women is cybercrime. As we have heard, there is new technology that can assist women, but can also be used as a weapon. According to UN Women, one in 10 women in the European Union has experienced cyber-harassment since the age of 15, including unwanted, offensive, sexually explicit e-mails or SMS messages, or offensive, inappropriate advances on a social networking site. The risk is highest among young women between the ages of 18 and 29.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.2/7">Tomorrow I shall be very pleased to be supporting <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25302" name="Liz Saville-Roberts">the hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Liz Saville Roberts)</phrase>, who will introduce a ten-minute rule Bill covering cybercrime of that kind. It has cross-party support, and has been prepared through the all-party parliamentary group on digital crime, with the able assistance of Harry Fletcher and the Digital Trust. As an officer of the group, I hope that it will initiate some more updated laws to deal with technology-enabled offences, as well as consolidating areas of the law that relate to cybercrime. While we know how helpful technology can be, we need to ensure that our Government act so that it is not used as yet another weapon with which to beat women.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.0/1">It is a pleasure to be taking part in the debate.&#160; However, notwithstanding all the good will and consensus, we should not forget the long and bitter struggle in which women in this country had to engage in order to ensure that their voices were heard and the issues that affected them were debated and addressed. It goes without saying that we should take a moment to reflect on the thousands of women across the world who are still fighting that good fight today&#8212;in some cases, in very desperate circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/2">I hope that the House will forgive me if I briefly break the lovely consensus to score one quick political point. The position of Minister for Women, as it was then, was created by Labour back in 1997.&#160;Women have played key roles in Labour from our earliest days, and of all the sweeping changes to Government&#160;introduced in 1997,&#160;I am glad to say that the creation of a ministerial position&#160;dedicated to women&#8217;s issues&#160;has been one of the most quietly enduring.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/3">I would like to mention two issues. The first is the issue of gender pricing.&#160;We are all familiar with the issues of unequal pay and discriminatory employment practices, but the often larger price tag associated with items marketed specifically at women is the reverse side of the same coin. I shall give the House a couple of examples. In research undertaken recently by <i>The Times</i>, it was found that razors for women cost, on average, nearly 50% more than the equivalent products for men. At Tesco, a pack of 10 pink disposable razors is&#160;twice the price of a standard pack, whose only difference is the colour.&#160;At Argos, a child&#8217;s scooter is &#163;5 more expensive in pink than&#160;in blue. And&#8212;this is something I still cannot quite get my head around&#8212;Bic&#160;sell &#8220;For Her&#8221; ballpoint pens that cost more than the standard model.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.0/4">Overall, it has been estimated that women&#8217;s products cost more 42% of the time, whereas men&#8217;s products cost more just 18% of the time.&#160;In some cases, it may well be that items aimed at women genuinely cost more to produce than those aimed at men, and that retailers pass that cost on to consumers. But in far too many cases, women are being told that they should buy a specific product because it is the only version suitable for women, when in reality there is no real difference in the product. In those cases, it can be argued that they are being misled. I urge the Minister to ensure that independent analysis and further study is carried out to identify the extent of unfair gender pricing and marketing practices in the UK. We need to quantify the full cumulative impact of gender differentials in pricing for women, so that we can start to get to grips with this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.1/1">Yes, that is pretty shocking. The right hon. Lady has pre-empted my next point. I was about to ask the Minister to meet the major retailers to identify what steps they are taking to rectify the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/2">My second point is related. Colleagues will know that over the last few months, along with many other Members, I have been banging the drum for the&#160;abolition of VAT on female sanitary products. Periods are a fact of human biology, not a leisure activity that women choose to indulge in. Tampons and other sanitary products are an absolute necessity, and certainly not the luxury that they are absurdly taxed as. More than 300,000 people have now signed a petition calling for a change to this ludicrous state of affairs, and it is about time that decision makers in Westminster and Brussels sat up and took notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.1/3">We have heard time and again from the Government that this is all in the hands of the European Commission, and that the UK is keen to press this issue in conjunction with our European partners, but the apparent lack of progress has left many of us wondering how&#160;committed the Government really are on this issue. I ask the Minister&#8212;as I asked her colleague, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24785" name="Harriett Baldwin">the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase>&#8212;to guarantee that the Prime Minister or the Chancellor will come to the House and make a statement once the Commission has responded to our request, so that the public can know exactly where we stand before the referendum. The official United Nations theme of this year&#8217;s International Women&#8217;s Day is &#8220;Make it Happen&#8221;, and that is precisely what I urge the Government to do.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> on securing this debate. For many years, it was impossible to hold such a debate in the main Chamber, so the fact that we are here today is a mark of progress in itself. Today, as we observe International Women&#8217;s Day, the charity Women for Refugee Women is launching a new campaign in which 99 women stand in solidarity with refugee women. I have the privilege of supporting this campaign along with many notable women including Mary Beard, Charlotte Church and Romola Garai, who recently appeared in the excellent film &#8220;Suffragette&#8221;, which I commend to any hon. Members who have not yet seen it.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/2">The campaign was created to reflect the 99 pregnant women who were detained in the Yarl&#8217;s Wood detention centre in 2014. Of those 99 women, only nine left detention to be removed from the UK. Indeed, the figures I have seen suggest that only a very small minority of detained women are removed while pregnant, suggesting that the practice is somewhat obsolete. I recently had confirmation from the chief executive of Serco that the total number of pregnant women held at Yarl&#8217;s Wood last year was 69; fewer than the year before, but still too many. I strongly urge the Government to do all that they can in 2016 to stop the holding of pregnant women in detention centres once and for all. There are better places for the detention of a woman who is expecting a baby. Sarah&#8212;not her real name&#8212;was detained while pregnant and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/3">&#8220;When I was in Yarl&#8217;s Wood I found it hard to believe that I was in the UK. I seemed to be in a place where human rights don&#8217;t exist. I saw so much misery and depression and mental illness while I was in there. There is constant crying and self-harm because the women don&#8217;t know why they are there or for how long.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/4">Some 2,000 asylum-seeking women are locked up in Yarl&#8217;s Wood each year. The majority are survivors of sexual violence and rape. Up to 93% of the women detained at Yarl&#8217;s Wood claim to have suffered sexual violence of some form. The most vulnerable women we can think of are being kept in far from ideal circumstances. The new &#8220;adults at risk&#8221; policy should reduce the detention of vulnerable women and stress the need to move away from detention overall, and I commend the Home Office for those important steps. The recent report by Stephen Shaw also made strong recommendations in that area and I believe that Home Office Ministers have recognised the need for reform. Along with Women for Refugee Women, I hope that discussions will soon bear fruit, so that pregnant women seeking protection in this country as refugees will no longer face detention. The cost for individual women is so great that we cannot afford to wait any longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.0/5">I also met the Yazidi women who are here today and was reminded of what drives women to seek safety in a country such as ours. Some 3,000 Yazidis are still in captivity in northern Iraq and Syria under Daesh occupation. Their children aged 11 to 16 are pressed into military service for Daesh and children as young as seven are being trained for action. These women are abused and raped. They are not in the UNHCR camps from which we have promised to take refugees, so a separate programme is clearly needed. Those two issues remind us of the drivers that bring pregnant women here and why we must ensure that we welcome them appropriately to our country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-08a.213.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10381" speakername="Siobhain McDonagh" colnum="213"  time="017:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160308/debtext/160308-0003.htm#160308-0003.htm_spnew44">
	<p pid="a.213.0/1">The theme of this year&#8217;s International Women&#8217;s Day is gender parity, and I want to focus on the plight of low-paid women. We like to think that we live in an enlightened age of women&#8217;s rights, but, shockingly, the World Economic Forum has calculated that the gender gap in health, education, politics and the economy will not close until 2133. It will therefore take another five generations before women are on an equal footing with men.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/2">Turning to women&#8217;s economic parity with men in the UK, a quarter of women now earn below the real living wage, which is &#163;9.40 an hour in London. Our so-called economic recovery and increasing employment are being achieved off the backs of low-paid women. A staggering 60% of new jobs for women created since 2010 have been in the lowest-paid industries. Women make up three quarters of those in part-time work, earning on average 25% less an hour than their full-time colleagues. They dominate the lowest-paid sectors, where 62% of workers paid below the living wage are women. Some 90% of nurses are women and 84% of carers are women. Over 70% of hospitality waiting staff are women. In all those professions, women perform important work, but they are hugely undervalued.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/3">Even in higher-paid jobs, women earn significantly less. The figure for median gross earnings for men is almost &#163;30,000, but it is just over &#163;24,000 for women&#8212;a 25% gap. While women make up half of all apprentices, they are being short-changed because of implicit gendered occupational segregation. Women dominate the lowest-paid apprenticeships, making up 83% of health and social care apprentices and 91% of childcare apprentices. Meanwhile, men dominate the highest-paid apprenticeships, where only 3% of engineering apprentices, 2% of construction apprentices and 10% of IT apprentices are women. The outcome is a gender pay gap in apprenticeships that is now at 21%. That means that a woman apprentice will earn just &#163;4.82 an hour on average, which compares with &#163;5.85 an hour for her male colleague. There are, however, a few promising developments for future generations, and I would like to take the opportunity to celebrate Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#8217;s sponsorship of TechFuture Girls, which I welcomed to Parliament last week. This is a remarkable network of clubs inspiring young girls into tech, where they are currently hugely under-represented, and it is available free to all schools in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/4">We also know that the Government&#8217;s gendered policies have seen benefits cuts that have hit women disproportionately, in favour of tax cuts for high earners, disproportionately benefiting men. Since 2010, &#163;26 billion-worth of cuts have been made in benefits, tax credits, pay and pensions, and a staggering 85% of that total has been taken solely from women. At the same time, the Government have watered down the Treasury&#8217;s gender impact assessments, meaning that the true extent of these changes and their real impact on women is being disguised.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.0/5">We might think that the introduction of the so-called &#8220;national living wage&#8221; would make the situation a lot better for women. I ask every woman in the House, when she listens to the Budget next week, just to consider that many women will take home less next month because of the national living wage, as a result of the stripping out of benefits, London weighting and double time on a Sunday. Let us then, as women, all stand together and say that those women deserve more, not less.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">When Eleanor Rathbone was elected to this House, one of her first speeches in the 1920s was about female genital mutilation.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">She then went on to talk about the need for family endowment, saying that it was ludicrous to think that the earnings, generally of a man, at paid work can support a family of varying size. That is why she argued for family allowances, which were opposed by all parties, for their own reasons, until the wash-up session before the 1945 elections, when that measure went through this House and the House of Lords with nobody opposing it. That shows the endurance needed to push good ideas to their eventual adoption. After that, we moved on to child benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3">When I was first elected, a Chancellor of the Exchequer &#8212;a Labour one, but that is not terribly important&#8212;argued that there was no need to bring in family allowance for the first child because the married couple&#8217;s allowance made up for that, not realising that half the married men had no dependent children and half the married men had a working wife. It was therefore one of the least directed ways of trying to support the needs of children while they are necessarily dependent&#8212;they are not allowed to work, so they cannot work and cannot earn.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/4">I wish to make two brief additional points. The first is that we need to equalise work, by taking paid and unpaid work together. We ought to have an indicator that comes out every two or three years showing how much of the unpaid work in a household is done by the men and how much is done by the women. Until we start getting that more consciously becoming more equal, the opportunities for equality in paid work will remain distant.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/5">The second point I wish to make is about expectations, hopes and opportunities. Anybody who went to see the exhibition in the Attlee Room in Portcullis House yesterday, where scientists, mathematicians and technologists were showing what they were doing, would not have been able to tell by the posters, except by looking at the name, whether the work and research had been done by a woman or by a man. One that particularly struck me was about the woman who had found a marker for prostate cancer. It was very important, low cost and effective, and it had no false positives. This was the kind of work that one would have expected to get a Nobel prize for if it had been done 30 years ago and if it had been shown to be working.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/6">When we can get every child in primary school to feel at ease with maths and when everyone with talent can move on, we will find that all our children can reach forward. Whether they end up as mathematicians, engineers or scientists does not really matter, but they need to be as familiar with those subjects as they are with the arts, literature, drama, sport and the like. Let us therefore have the same expectations, opportunities and hopes here.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/7">Tied to that, may I suggest that we also try to get more attention paid to an article in today&#8217;s ConservativeHome about the Marmot curve and how we can try to get it into a flat line? No matter what the deprivation of the household we are born into, no matter whether we are Asian or black, in a lone parent family or not, we have the opportunity that education gives us, and that the hopes and expectations of our parents can give us, and we do not have our life chances determined by who are parents were, but more by what our parents do and what we can do ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.0/1">We are just less than one month short of the 105th anniversary of Emily Wilding Davison&#8217;s night in the Undercroft here. In and of itself, that action was not a turning point, but it was part of a larger movement and societal change that have at least made strides in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/2">Emily Davison is a fine example of how it often takes straightforward thinking and direct action to make the changes that later generations come to see as normal. Changing the normal view of things is what drives society forward and it is very seldom easy, especially for women. I suggest then that it is the responsibility of every decent Government in every civilised nation on this earth to help advance the rights of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/3">Less than two weeks ago, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom told us how his Government had helped arms manufacturers from the UK sell arms to Saudi Arabia. That is a country where women cannot open a bank account without their husband&#8217;s permission, or try on clothes in a shop&#8212;the thought of an undressed woman behind a door, it seems, would be too much for Saudi men. It is a place where a woman cannot drive a car. I think that I am right in saying that it is the only country in the world where it is illegal for a woman to drive.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/4">When a teenage girl was gang raped in 2006, the courts sentenced her to corporal punishment for being out of the house without a chaperone. She received 90 lashes for getting raped. Just last year, Suad al-Shamari, a Saudi women&#8217;s rights activist and the first female lawyer to appear before a Saudi court, was released from prison where she had been detained for three months without trial for advocating women&#8217;s issues. She was released when she promised to reduce her activism. This is the nation that the UK Prime Minister feels it is appropriate to celebrate doing business with.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/5">Human rights are women&#8217;s rights and the rights of the women of Saudi Arabia should be at the top of the agenda for inter-Governmental relations. International Women&#8217;s Day has to be about promoting the rights and freedoms of women across the world. It has to be about ending repression, about engendering respect, and about parity of esteem between women and men.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.0/6">The Government of the UK should be crowing when they make advances in those areas rather providing more weapons to what is, essentially, a repressive regime for women. In the face of all that, women in Saudi Arabia are changing the face of their country. Despite the roadblocks put in their way, we see ground-breaking women such as Haifaa al-Mansour who wrote and directed the first feature film to be shot there, and Samira Ibrahim Islam and Hayat Sindi, who are Saudi scientists who proved that Saudi women can match men in science. Using humour to chip away at the patriarchy is female Saudi comedian Amy Roko.

	<p pid="a.216.0/1">Like many women sitting at home watching this debate today, I remember catching a glimpse of a female MP on telly and wondering what kind of woman one had to be to enter politics. What kind of women is she, I thought. Now, working alongside them, I have encountered strong women, such as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase> who have brought this debate to the Chamber today. Their strength comes from knowing who they are. They are tenacious and determined women who have gained respect in this male-dominated field of politics. There are 191 of these pioneers in this House, and we on the Government Benches should be proud to claim 68 of them, 27 of whom were newly elected last year. However, while being proud, we must also be ambitious for more. We who are lucky enough to be here must take seriously our responsibility to those who are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/2">I would like to ask the House to join me in saluting all women and especially all female parliamentarians. It is often suggested that we are pioneers, and that we must buck trends, refashion the system and upset the milk cart. Yes, in a way we must&#8212;we are all pioneers and have shared experiences of the fight and struggle for the privilege of sitting on these green Benches. It is our duty to raise issues that have previously gone unspoken. The collective female membership of this House is a powerful forum for change, and I want to raise three brief points.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/3">First, how do we as a collective compel legislators, parliaments, the United Nations and all the decision brokers to better represent the lives and aspirations of women? Here today we have a groundswell of energy to represent women from all walks of life, and we need to hold national and international organisations to account to perform for women and not just for men.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/4">Secondly, how do we harness technology to promote and support women? We heard earlier about online stalking, bullying and cybercrime. We are all on social media and all of us female parliamentarians must have been trolled at some point. Imagine the response there would be if we women who are targeted by misogynistic trolls all supported each other in shouting them down. Let us challenge Facebook and Twitter to support women to get online and shame the bullying tactics of anonymous people, mostly men, who dare to put us in our place. We must come together not just for one day, but use our collective voice to shout more loudly every day. We must take over those social media spaces and make them our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/5">Finally, as an MP in this Parliament I do not have to justify my gender to represent one of my constituents, nor do I have to justify the way in which I represent someone because of my gender. That is how it must be in society too, and in every community, every family and every organisation, but that, unfortunately, is not the case throughout the country. In my constituency, Wealden, men earn 20.8% more than women. We must champion those women in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/6">In sharia courts in this very country, the testimonies of women are worth half as much as those of men. We must represent those women in this House. In communities where gangs groom and abuse children, their victims&#8217; testimonies are often ignored by the authorities. We must speak up for those women.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/7">We still have a long way to go to ensure that the testimonies of women are taken as seriously as those of men. When all of society accepts that our daughters, our sisters and our mothers are not owned by any man&#8212;are not owned by anybody but themselves&#8212;and have something to offer because of, rather than in spite of, their gender, only then will we have succeeded.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">It is an honour to speak in today&#8217;s debate and to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25354" name="Nusrat Ghani">the hon. Member for Wealden (Nusrat Ghani)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/2">My constituency is not short of formidable, tenacious, and inspiring women. It is a great privilege for me to be the first woman to represent Neath in the House, and to have the responsibility of carrying on the legacy of all the women who have made contributions to public life in Neath. I am, in more ways than one, standing on the shoulders of giantesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/3">I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Gwenda Thomas, the first and only woman Welsh Assembly Member for Neath, who is retiring at the end of the month after 17 years of service to both her constituency and Wales&#8217;s devolved Administration. Winifred Coombe Tennant, a British suffragette and philanthropist, made her home at Cadoxton Lodge, in my constituency. She was a leading figure in the campaign for women&#8217;s suffrage in south Wales. Katherine Jenkins, the globally recognised soprano, was born and grew up in Neath, and her mother remains a committed activist. The recently ennobled Dame Si&#226;n Phillips, a world renowned actress and singer, is from Gwaun Cae Gurwen. Another of Neath&#8217;s famous singing women, Bonnie Tyler, needs no introduction, nor does her song, &#8220;Lost in France&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/4">During the miners&#8217; strike of 1984, women led from the front of the picket lines, organised valley support groups, and kept spirits alive in homes and heartlands across south Wales. The story of the 1984 miners&#8217; strike was most recently told in the triumphant film &#8220;Pride&#8221;, which tells how the lesbian and gay community supported miners in the Dulais valley, and the story of the tireless and fearless Hefina Headon, a woman who was as much a leader during those times as any lodge chairman.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/5">Out of that story of pride, adversity, camaraderie and success grew an innovative community organisation called the Dove Workshop, set up by women for women. Its founders include Hefina Headon and Mair Francis. The organisation has been held up across Europe as a model for community adult education. Established to offer women opportunities to retrain during the years that followed the miners strike, it was the birthplace of the Community University of the Valleys and has subsequently supported thousands of women to gain qualifications, including undergraduate degrees.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.0/6">The Dulais valley is also home to Bethan Howell, Welsh rugby international, founding member of Seven Sisters RFC ladies&#8217; rugby team and champion of equality. I must also pay tribute to two exceptional women who have had a profound impact on sport in Wales, Professor Laura McAlister and Sarah Powell, both of whom have had outstanding sporting careers and are now leading the way as the first female chair and CEO of Sport Wales respectively. Of course, one of Great Britain&#8217;s greatest Olympians of all time is Baroness &#8220;Tanni&#8221; Grey-Thompson of Eaglescliffe. In my sport of squash we have Welsh international Tesni Evans, who has recently reached a career-high world ranking of 24. Of course there is also Margaret Coleman, wife of Donald Coleman, one of my predecessors, one of the most tenacious women I have ever met, and one of the busiest octogenarians I know.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.1/2">I am proud to be taking through a private Member&#8217;s Bill&#8212;it is scheduled to have its Second Reading next Friday&#8212;that would bind in law the need to include mothers&#8217; names on marriage certificates, something that does not currently happen, and an inequality that is yet to be set right.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/3">It was a Labour Government who passed the Equal Pay Act 1970, a monumental occasion in women&#8217;s history, but one that, unfortunately, did not mark the end of inequality. Forty-six years on, women still earn only, on average, 81p for every &#163;1 earned by a man. There is much more to be done.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.0/1">I hope that you will not think it boastful of me, Mr Speaker, if I declare that my constituency of Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire leads where others follow, particularly when it comes to electing female MPs, for I am not the first female MP to represent the seat. In 1921 the good people of Louth elected Margaret Wintringham. She has an important place in history; she was the first English-born female MP in this place, and the third ever female MP elected to this place. Fast-forward to 2015, and I am the 428th female MP, because since 1918 only 450 women have been elected to this place. That total is lower than the number of men in the House of Commons just in this Parliament. Therefore, when people ask why we need campaigns such as International Women&#8217;s Day, I have to say that sadly we do not need to look too far.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">We need more women in politics, not just in the House of Commons but across the board. We need more women, of every party, standing up for local communities in councils. We need more women reporting on national and local politics. We need more women shaping policies in think-tanks and universities across the country. We need more women in Whitehall advising Ministers on implementing policies. We need that not because women&#8217;s experiences are in any way better or worse than men&#8217;s, but because they are different. We must reflect the experiences of women and men across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.1/1">Does my hon. Friend think that we perhaps do not have so many women in higher positions because women are not so good at putting themselves forward in the systems that are in place, which they have to go through to get to those positions? Men&#8212;I obviously have massive admiration for our colleagues&#8212;are very good at that, but women are not so good. I have two daughters going through the process now.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend&#8217;s daughters. A lot of women are perhaps used to being the power behind the throne, to use a well-worn phrase. I hope that one of the things we have done today, in celebrating International Women&#8217;s Day and inviting young women from our constituencies into the House of Commons, is to give those young women a little more confidence and courage in putting themselves forward when they want to achieve something.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/2">Let me return to 1921 for a moment. My predecessor Mrs Wintringham campaigned on an issue that, sadly, is familiar to us in 2016: equal pay. After 95 years, there is still inequality of pay. We know that the situation is getting better, and the Government are doing a great deal to tackle it, but I welcome the promise of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase> to hold them to account so that we can do even better.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/3">Why does any of this matter? It matters because it is the right thing to do. It matters when we meet young women in our constituencies. Today, I have had the pleasure of being visited by two young constituents, Jessica and Ellie&#8212;they made the trip down from Louth and Horncastle, which is three hours&#8217; drive at best. They have seen Downing Street, they have seen this place in action and they have listened to the 50:50 panel. That is all important stuff, which I hope will really energise and enthuse them in their careers in the future. For Jessica and Ellie, and for the millions of women across our constituencies, this debate is so important. However, this is not just about today; it is about what we do from now until the next International Women&#8217;s Day and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.2/4">I am pleased that the Chamber has been so busy this afternoon. May I say thank you to all the male Members of Parliament who have come to support the campaign? Although women may form 51% of the population, we must not forget that men form the other 49%. I may just have been terribly controversial there without meaning it, but anyway, I thank everyone who has supported the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.0/1">This is the second debate I have spoken in on international women&#8217;s issues recently. At an event last week, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10202" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> commented on the fact that it was much harder for women to get elected to Parliament than it was for many of the mediocre men who are here. I am therefore happy to speak on behalf of mediocre men.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.0/2">Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting two young women, Alalea and Liza, who came here as part of the SET for BRITAIN event. They are both PhD students from Imperial College&#8212;my old college. Alalea is working on the subject of concrete, and Liza is working on wear particles. Although neither subject might sound totally stimulating, I can assure Members that the two young women&#8217;s presentations were absolutely brilliant.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.0/3">However, we cannot deduce too much from what those young women are doing. Clearly, at an international level, a huge amount of work still needs to be done on women&#8217;s rights. Many Members will have received the email from Amnesty International setting out the six reasons why it thinks we still need an International Women&#8217;s Day. One of the examples it provides is that in Ireland, for instance,</p>
	<p pid="a.220.0/4">&#8220;women with fatal health conditions are often refused life-saving treatment because of the risk it poses to the foetus.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.0/5">Clearly, therefore, we still need to make major advances on women&#8217;s rights abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.2/1">I am afraid I will not, because many Members want to speak, and if I give way, that will mean less time for others.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/2">There are still strong international challenges that need to be addressed, and there is certainly no room for complacency at a local level. The domestic violence statistics from my own borough show that domestic abuse forms 40% of all violent crime in Sutton, in the south-west London suburbs, which is relatively affluent. Of course, domestic violence is also severely under-reported, so perhaps only 50% of incidents are reported to the police.</p>

Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> made a rather ungenerous comment about the Liberal Democrats as a party. She and I have discussed gender issues, and she could have asked me what the Lib Dems have been doing. I would have explained to her that our five most winnable Westminster seats in Scotland have been allocated to women candidates, so barring a dreadful election result in 2020&#8212;which I know some will wish on us&#8212;there should be a significant improvement. The same will be true in England, because our party conference is going to agree, I hope, to something for which I have been pushing, namely an all-women shortlist for every English seat from which a man is standing down. Barring unforeseen bad results, there should be a significant improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.2/4">I want to finish on the subject of female genital mutilation. My colleague Lynne Featherstone, who is now in the House of Lords, pushed very hard on the issue when she was a Minister. I want to leave the Under-Secretary of State for Women and Equalities and Family Justice, who will respond to the debate, with one point, which is that if we are serious about doing something about FGM, there needs to be mandatory personal, social, health and economic education, because otherwise the issues will not be addressed in some schools.

Anybody who reads the <i>Hansard</i> of last year&#8217;s debate will see that no male MPs made speeches, but some made interventions, so it is great to see so many men taking part in today&#8217;s debate, because this issue affects all of us. It affects our wives, sisters, daughters and grandmothers. None of us in this House would accept it if our daughters were prevented from reaching their true opportunity, if our wives were paid less than a man doing the same job, or if our mothers were discriminated against. We must all work together to ensure that we bring fairness and equality to Britain, and this debate is an important part of that.</p>

Engineering has a turnover of more than &#163;1 trillion, which is a quarter of all UK enterprises, yet 64% of employers say that there is a shortage of engineers. That shortfall will lead to there being 55,000 fewer engineers by 2015 than the UK economy needs. Women make up only 9% of the engineering workforce. That is a scandal, and we need to do more to address it.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.4/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> for securing the debate along with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11447" name="Dawn Butler">the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler)</phrase>. I am pleased that we are here in Parliament to recognise and celebrate International Women&#8217;s Day, along with women and Parliaments across the world. I am also happy to be the third consecutive woman to represent Brentford and Isleworth. We must remember that although women have guaranteed rights in law in the UK, there are still cultures, attitudes and practices that hold women back, subject them to violence and deprive the economy of the benefit of their full involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.4/2">So many issues that disproportionately affect women are worthy of debate, but I will focus on women&#8217;s status in the workplace. In the past 30 to 40 years, there has been a significant increase in female employment. As a consequence, there has been positive Government policy change on matters including workplace rights, childcare and anti-discrimination law. One of the big issues now is flexible working. Employees can have flexible working, but they have to have been in post for six months. Many employers are beginning to realise the value of flexible working. An employer in my constituency, Debbie Leon, who represents a successful and growing company called Fashionizer, recognises that having flexible working practices enables her to get the best employees in the field.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.4/3">Unfortunately, such practices are not always to be found in traditional workplaces, and I hope that Ministers will review the position. In fact, the Minister for Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24766" name="Nicholas Boles">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles)</phrase>, told the Women and Equalities Committee that he used flexible working arrangements at the point of recruitment in the organisation that he ran to get the best staff for the job. If a Minister could do that in a previous workplace, I hope that Ministers will be encouraged to introduce a right for employees to request flexible working from the outset. I want women at all stages of their caring responsibilities to feel free to apply for jobs and not to be constrained by fixed work times and work days.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.4/4">We cannot talk about flexible working hours and workers&#8217; rights without talking about the European Union. Britain&#8217;s membership of the EU gave British workers the right to minimum paid maternity and paternity leave, and to equal pay and anti-discrimination laws. That is why I will be voting to stay in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It was good that she raised that point in Prime Minister&#8217;s Question Time last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/2">There is overwhelming evidence that harnessing female entrepreneurship can only be positive for our economy. Indeed, a report that was published in 2013 calculated that boosting female entrepreneurship could deliver approximately &#163;60 billion extra to the UK economy. We also know that women bring a diversity dividend, whereby gender-balanced boards are more successful on every measure, according to a study by McKinsey &amp; Co.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/3">We are making good progress, but we still lag someway behind the USA, where women are twice as likely to be entrepreneurially active as UK women, although the rates for men in both countries are the same. In 1988, the USA put in place a women&#8217;s business Act, which introduced long-term infrastructure measures, such as the women&#8217;s business centre programme, and created the National Women&#8217;s Business Council. It is no coincidence that since those initiatives went live, over 30% of US enterprises have been female-owned. I ask Ministers to look carefully at such models to determine what lessons can be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/4">Evidence suggests that one of the biggest barriers to women starting their own business is a fear of failure. Studies often say that female entrepreneurs are held back by risk aversion and low confidence. In fact, it is not necessarily a lack of self-confidence, but an informed assessment of how prepared they feel to embark on the all-important first step. That is backed up by the fact that women who have undergone some form of enterprise training are twice as likely to be engaged in entrepreneurial activity, with specific female-focused business support being vital to greatly encouraging participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/5">With that in mind, it is imperative that we offer our potential female entrepreneurs the best possible chance to achieve by giving them effective information, advice and guidance in schools. Schemes such as the Careers &amp; Enterprise Company are a welcome addition and provide an excellent opportunity to plug an all-too-evident hole in our current careers advisory process. That alone is not enough, however, so we need to encourage more female role models and entrepreneurs into our schools, colleges and universities. A big step forward in that respect would be for senior women in business and politics to engage practically with their local students&#8212;to tell them their story, which would undoubtedly not have been all plain sailing, and, in essence, to inspire and support a new generation of female entrepreneurs.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.2/6">We are in an exciting place in our history. We understand more than ever what we can do to support, nurture and encourage female enterprise. With the right long-term strategy from the Government, in partnership with our current entrepreneurs, the goal of equality and parity in business is a lot closer than we might think. I look forward to playing my part, through the all-party group, to help to make that happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.0/1">I am delighted to speak in this important debate. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase>&#8212;before this debate started, she chaired an excellent cross-party panel with young women about International Women&#8217;s Day&#8212;and, indeed, to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase> for her an excellent contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/2">There is no doubt that huge progress has been made for women around the world in the 97 years that have passed since Nancy Astor took her seat on the green Benches. Many hon. Members will recall the story of how, when the first female MP tried to reach her usual place in the middle of a row, other MPs moved closer together to leave no space for her to get through, and then laughed and jeered as she forced past them. The braying some of us still hear in the Chamber seems a tired relic of those distant days&#8212;it is time to move on. Perhaps we should move on from the outdated &#8220;Hear, hear&#8221; to modern applause. That would be a welcome change, but it is probably best described as work in progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/3">I should say that while 17 of us on the SNP Benches are women, the 54 of us are 100% feminists. I am very glad that my party has led the way, with Nicola Sturgeon&#8217;s gender-balanced Cabinet. More than two thirds of our new candidates in the elections to the Scottish Parliament are women.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.3/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, and until we believe that there is a level playing field in how people are chosen, positive action is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.3/2">It is as important to seek to modernise practices and attitudes towards women in public and political life now as it was 100 years ago. We cannot stand still. It is vital for democracy that those who make laws across the world are representative of their countries at large, and that is important in the fight against Daesh and in the debate on our continuing membership of the European Union. Last year, I was privileged to chair an event that aimed to give a platform to the female perspective in Syria. Women are so often the forgotten victims of conflicts, and the forms of terrorism that we see today greatly impact on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.3/3">Women have been at the forefront of action in Syria to combat child recruitment to armed groups, and they have led and co-ordinated the disarmament of men in public places in some refugee camps so that children do not have to walk around and see armed men. Those initiatives also disguise the names of their community projects to keep their work hidden from Daesh networks. Only by taking such action can we prepare Syrian society for a future beyond the current conflict. Women have so much to offer, and to date the debate on the European Union seems largely to have been led by men in grey suits jockeying for position. It is time for women&#8217;s voices to be heard. We must not underestimate the part that the EU has played in protecting and promoting equality and the rights of women across our continent.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.3/4">I wonder what the world might look like if more women were at the top table, heading campaigns in EU institutions, peace talks and diplomacy. I respectfully suggest that it would be a more equal world, and a better place for us all. The Scottish Government are committed to working towards gender equality, and I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25295" name="Angela Crawley">the Member for Lanark and Hamilton East (Angela Crawley)</phrase>, who will speak further on that matter. Everybody appears to believe in gender equality, but simply believing in it is not enough. The WASPI women, the female workforce and victims of domestic violence are waiting. We must get on with the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.3/5">Here is to those women who championed equality before us, against greater odds and much higher obstacles. To all the girls who will follow us, we are here to support you; to the men who support us, we welcome you. Women and girls hold the key to change and progress, so let us not waste a minute in unlocking these doors and creating opportunities across the world. Equality is a fundamental human right.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.0/1">I am honoured to speak in this important debate, and I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> for securing it. I am one of 68 female Conservative MPs, and one of 191 female MPs who have the privilege of representing their constituents and their gender in Parliament. In what remains a male-dominated environment, we have illustrated that not only can we compete with our male counterparts, but our input plays an essential part in good, balanced decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/2">When considering the impact made by women in positions of leadership, particularly in business, we should be proud that there are more women-led businesses than ever before. Historically, this country&#8217;s business culture has hindered women, who are just as accomplished as men when it comes to work. When I started in the retail sector, very few women held management positions and they were kept predominantly on the shop floor. Women often lack confidence and the belief that they can do any job as well as any man. I believe that we must instil a girl&#8217;s belief in herself at an early age.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/3">My city of Derby has a rich history in the engineering and manufacturing sector, and STEM subjects are often at the core of that. There is an ever-increasing demand for skilled workers in these areas. I want to encourage more women to get involved in STEM, if they wish to, and to eliminate the ongoing perception that that is a male-dominated area.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/4">I want to ensure that women and girls have choices and that all doors are open so that should a young woman wish to become a chef, she can; so that if she wants to become a doctor, she can; and so that if she wants to be an engineer, she can. For me, this is about supporting girls in their careers of choice and encouraging aspiration, something to which this Government are undoubtedly committed. Along with the great strides made in tackling the root cause of the gender pay gap, it is clear we are heading in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.0/5">I could, of course, continue at length, but I would like to finish by highlighting a very special woman: my grandmother who, at the age of 97, had an amazingly full life. She worked all her working life and was as fiery at 97 as she was when she was 27. She is proof positive that all women, whatever they do, should be proud of themselves and their achievements. I am proud to be an MP, a mum and a wife, but most of all I am proud to be a woman.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.2/1">I do, of course, agree with the hon. Gentleman very sincerely.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/2">I speak as a Member of an institution that is still heavily male-dominated, in a profession that is still male-dominated. As others have said, although men are still in a minority in the Chamber today, it is easy to see why women might feel excluded from politics. A woman watching recent debates about increasing the state pension age for women would have seen a Chamber dominated by men arguing that women did not need to be given more notice that they would need to work longer before retirement, and that that somehow did not count as discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/3">It is with this awareness that I firmly support means to propel us towards a fairer society and a fairer economy. We still live in a society where the important workplaces&#8212;the boardrooms, the debating chambers, the engineering consoles and the fighter jets&#8212;are dominated by men. It is in those places that are considered insignificant to society&#8212;the nurseries and the nursing homes&#8212;where we find that poorly-paid women make up the great majority of the workforce doing the things that do not really matter, such as looking after their fellow human beings. Surely the time has come for us as a society to adjust our values. Why is it that those spheres of activities that are traditionally women&#8217;s work are so undervalued? Why should maintaining machinery and playing tricks with money have such high status, and thus be better paid, than caring for people in their old age?</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/4">While girls have traditionally been directed towards certain careers, equally boys have grown up thinking that caring for their fellow human beings is not for them. In activities such as politics, taking risks is valued and respected, but girls are still conditioned to tread carefully and live carefully&#8212;not causing offence, not drawing attention to their intelligence and not being adversarial. To describe a man as ambitious is complimentary, but to describe a woman as ambitious implies criticism. That is why we must lead by example.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/5">The National Assembly for Wales became in 2003 the first gender-balanced national legislature in the world, helped in part by positive discrimination towards women. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood became a Member of the National Assembly in 2003 under Plaid Cymru&#8217;s positive discrimination policy for regional list nomination. At my party&#8217;s spring conference this weekend, four years after she was made leader,</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/6">Leanne was introduced to the stage by 17-year-old Lucie Wiltshire, who got involved in politics after meeting Leanne.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.2/7">I think that we would all agree that no young person should ever be prevented from reaching their goals because of their gender. What is equally important, however, is how society enables girls to imagine their goals. As a former teacher, I urge us to encourage others &#8212;girls and women&#8212;to take risks, to be fearless and to embrace ambition. As always, we are limited only by our imaginations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-08a.228.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24731" speakername="Rebecca Harris" colnum="228"  time="017:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160308/debtext/160308-0003.htm#160308-0003.htm_spnew77">
	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in this important annual debate. In the time left, I wish to focus on the gender pay gap and the lack of women in senior professional roles in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">The gender pay gap is stubbornly persistent, despite the Equal Pay Act 1970 having been passed more than 40 years ago, and women are still woefully under-represented in the higher levels of British industry. We are aware of the depressing statistic that more men called John serve as chief executive officers in FTSE 100 companies than women. We can laugh at the statistics, but they reveal a depressing truth: our major industries are still not reflecting our society and are therefore not drawing on as wide a gene pool as they could.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">The causes often begin early. I believe that schools need to play a significant role in overturning stereotypes, both in what they teach and what careers advice they offer, given that the gender pay gap is, in part, driven by the types of job women do. We all know that attitudes can change. Nearly 40 years ago, my own sister was a straight-As pupil and informed her school that she wanted to go into medicine. The reaction of those at her school was to suggest that, as a girl, she might prefer to consider nursing. Characteristically, she totally ignored that advice, and fortunately the world was spared a first-rate but horrendously bossy nurse. Instead, we got a superb doctor.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">Nearly 40 years later, the majority of applicants to medical school are women, and something similar is occurring in law, so we know that we can change attitudes. We need to make the same changes in other careers for women, especially in engineering, where we have a desperate need for more talent, but we need to do it faster than we have changed attitudes towards other careers. I welcome the progress the Government have made over the past five years and the huge improvement in the number of girls taking STEM A-levels, but we need to keep pushing the case to get more into engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">The problem does not end when girls leave schools. Women still face unconscious discrimination in the workplace, and too many women feel they must choose between motherhood and building a career. I therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s move to achieve shared parental leave. Anecdotally, we know that when women have families, their managers often feel they are less committed to the organisation, especially if they choose to take part-time work. Conversely, it seems, anecdotally, that when men become fathers, their managers sometimes feel they must require a pay rise and a promotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">Shared parental leave, even if men do not take it up, will at least force men to face the dilemma and think through what effect it might have on their career prospects, which, if they become mangers of women in the future, could be of enormous benefit. As we have said, we want both men and women fighting to make sure this annual debate becomes something for the history curriculum in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.2/1">I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/2">Members will be aware that I have been questioning the rape clause since last July&#8217;s Budget, but I have still not had a satisfactory answer to explain why this policy is required and how it will work. Lord Freud suggested on <phrase class="date" code="2016-01-27">27 January</phrase> in the other place that proof that a woman&#8217;s third child was born of rape might not come via the criminal justice system, but instead come from a third-party official such as a GP or a social worker. This does not, however, resolve the problem. For many reasons, these women may not be able to tell their GPs about their circumstances, and there may be no social work involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/3">I am not sure how many women will end up claiming under this policy. If a woman is in a relationship and suffering domestic abuse, she might be putting herself at serious risk by making the claim in the first place. A similar issue arises in the household payments system and universal credit&#8212;if a woman requests a split payment, her partner will almost certainly know about it. She may well be doubly damned by this Government, because Lord Freud has also refused to allow an exemption to the two-child policy for women escaping abusive, controlling relationships, which is what the Scottish Government are trying to counteract.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/4">There is still a distinct possibility that a woman could tell her story to the Department for Work and Pensions and Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs and not be believed. Those organisations are not known, after all, for taking people at their word. There is not yet guidance, and the Government will not say who they are consulting.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/5">The two-child policy also fails completely to recognise the complex nature of families in 2016. A couple who have children from previous relationships will, under the two-child policy, lose their child tax credit eligibility when they come together. There is no detail yet on exactly how multiple births will be protected. There is no acknowledgement of the impact on those who, for religious reasons, may traditionally have larger families. That is hardly fitting for a Government who vaunt their &#8220;family test&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/6">I have heard it said that families should have only the children they can afford, but that point of view does not acknowledge the challenges that life presents. A family may have three children and be well able to afford them, but what if one parent loses their job, takes ill or dies? There is no safety net whatever in the two-child policy to cover that eventuality, particularly if the remaining parent is required to work less to care for the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.2/7">The two-child policy is rigid, ineffectual and unnecessary. The rape clause stigmatises vulnerable women and their families. This is a policy made on the hoof for the sake of a <i>Daily Mail</i> headline and a Tory conference press release. It is tantamount to social engineering. My plea on International Women&#8217;s Day 2016 is that we reject this kind of policy&#8212;the two-child policy and the rape clause&#8212;and we support every woman and every child equally.</p>

	<p pid="a.230.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> for securing this hugely important debate. Today, on International Women&#8217;s Day, I want to draw Members&#8217; attention to an international crime that is now being perpetrated against young girls and women here in our country today. I refer to breast ironing. For the benefit of any Members who might not have heard of it, this is a ritualised form of child abuse that originated in Cameroon but is now happening in the UK whereby hot objects heated on a stove are placed on a girl&#8217;s breasts during puberty to retard the growth of the breast in the bizarre and wrong belief that this in some way makes them less sexually attractive to men.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/2">This is a hidden crime in the same way that female genital mutilation was a hidden crime just a few years ago. It is hidden because it is carried out by a very close family member, normally a mother, sister, aunt or grandmother. A charity called CAME, which is run by lady called Margaret Nyuydzewira, estimates that 1,000 girls and young women in this country are having their breasts mutilated today because of this cultural activity. Because it is so hidden, I decided to do a freedom of information request to all police forces in the UK to try to find out what they are doing about this abhorrent practice. I am devastated to say that 15% of all police forces did not even know that this practice existed, and 38% of those that responded said that they had no information about it and could not tackle it.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/3">Having revealed those shocking figures, I want to talk briefly about what action we can take. On International Women&#8217;s Day we must send out a clear message that this is a crime and that the perpetrators, whoever they may be, must and should be prosecuted. I know of one case reported to the police in 2013; they had an existing pool of offences to choose from, but there is considerable confusion in this area of the law. I hope that I can call on the Government today to create a stand-alone offence of breast ironing to protect young girls and women in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.0/4">We are a Government who have taken fantastic action on female genital mutilation. In the Serious Crime Act 2015, we provided anonymity for victims and created an offence of failing to protect someone from FGM. We also issued statutory guidance. I hope that we can raise the profile of breast ironing, and that it can be treated in the same way. It is a crime that is secret in nature, it has a long-term and irreversible effect on women&#8217;s breasts, and people will not report a family member. Unless we do something about it, this hidden crime will remain just that: hidden.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.0/1">I started today by being interviewed by a researcher from Brunel University about the subject of women as leaders. One of the questions that she asked me was &#8220;What qualities make a woman a good leader?&#8221; I do not actually think that leadership skills are gender-specific, but what women do need are more female leaders to act as role models, and for it to be seen as commonplace for women to take the lead in business, politics, sport, and other areas that tend to be male-dominated, such as science and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/2">The motion refers to the need to get more women into Parliament. As many Members have pointed out, we currently have 191 female MPs. I am proud to say that 99 of them are Labour MPs, and I am proud to be a member of that group. In respect of female representation in Parliament, we are getting better, but we clearly have a long way to go. I believe that one of the issues is that this place is still perceived as being very male-oriented. However, improvements have been made in sitting times, and I do not want any retrograde steps to be taken in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/3">Women often have to dance to men&#8217;s tunes. I am reminded of Ginger Rogers, who, when she was asked about dancing with Fred Astaire, replied, &#8220;It&#8217;s simple: I just follow what Fred does.&#8221; Then she added, &#8220;But backwards, and in high heels.&#8221; For me, that sums up many situations in which women find themselves today. We need to find new ways of working that suit us, our families, and our responsibilities and commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/4">A few Members&#8212;including <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase>, in her excellent opening speech&#8212;have referred to the raising of the women&#8217;s state pension age. The WASPI women have shown themselves to be committed campaigners against that injustice. These are women who have been excluded from occupational pension schemes because they work part-time. These are women who took long periods out of work to bring up children, childcare not being available to many. These are women who have suffered ill health: many of those who have contacted me have had to leave work because of health issues, and are surviving on minimal incomes. These are women who are caring for elderly relatives. One of my constituents told me that she had had to give up work to care for five elderly relatives, and she also provides respite foster care.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/5">These are hard-working, committed, caring women, who have given much to their communities, families and workplaces, yet it appears that their reward is to have to wait longer for the state pension on which they were relying. Would it not be a wonderful gesture if, on International Women&#8217;s Day, the Government were to commit themselves to proper transitional arrangements for the WASPI women? Let them walk not backwards in high heels, but forwards, and in sensible shoes.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.0/1">I commend my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> for securing the debate. In the short time is available to me, I wish to focus particularly on female genital mutilation. On this one day of the year, we have a chance to audit where we have come from and where we wish to go. I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24860" name="Jake Berry">the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry)</phrase> that we have some good legislation, notably the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 and the Serious Crime Act 2015. As has already been mentioned, it is now a crime to fail to protect a woman or a girl from female genital mutilation, which is very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.0/2">I believe that good training is available. I myself have just completed the Home Office&#8217;s free online training. However, improvements can be made. It is excellent that the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has a free 0800 telephone number, and the Government are doing brilliant work with The Girl Generation, an African-led movement to end female genital mutilation. I applaud every African woman, and every African girl, who is part of that incredibly important movement. However, more than 120 million women and girls in the world have suffered from FGM, including 100,000 in our community, and we can do more. There have been no successful prosecutions in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">What more can we do? Having read the motion, I believe that we should not hide behind letters and acronyms; we should call it female genital mutilation. The Home Office online training has clinical diagrams, but they hide the absolute barbarity of the crime. The training should include images of it, however appalling they might be. In fairness to the Home Office training, however, it pointed out that the equivalent of female genital mutilation in a man would be the removal of the head of the penis and of a third of the shaft. That is what we are dealing with, and this practice has to be abolished.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/3">We can do more. The most vulnerable people in this country are isolated migrant populations. We are not reaching out to them, and they are not reaching out to us. Speaking as a doctor, I know that if a woman comes to my clinical practice but cannot communicate with me in the same language, it is difficult for me to ask very personal questions through an interpreter. It is even harder if that interpreter is a male friend or relative. We have to do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/4">I shall finish by quoting Gloria Steinem, because we cannot have international women&#8217;s day without her. She has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/5">&#8220;The human race is like a bird with two wings, and if one wing is broken, no one can fly.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.233.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate, and I thank the hon. Members for Eastleigh (Mims Davies) and for Brent Central (Dawn Butler) for setting the scene so vividly and efficiently and for focusing our attention on the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/2">I look forward to the day when there are no longer issues that adversely affect women more than men, but still in 2016 we have a long way to go. Each year more than 100,000 people in the UK are at imminent risk of being murdered or seriously injured as a result of domestic abuse. Women are much more likely than men to be the victims of severe domestic abuse. Nearly one in three women who suffer from domestic abuse report that the first incidence of violence happened while they were pregnant and at their most vulnerable. Victims of abuse have a higher rate of drug and/or alcohol misuse. At least 20% of high-risk victims of abuse report using drugs and/or alcohol, and 40% of victims at high risk of abuse report mental health difficulties. More than 90% of these victims are female; only 5% to 10% are male. There is of course a plethora of other issues still facing women, but I found those statistics most disturbing and worrying.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/3">Of course, it is not all doom and gloom. We see women across the world breaking the glass ceiling each and every day. As we approach our centenary in Northern Ireland, we usher in a new era under our new First Minister, Arlene Foster. She has been in post for 10 weeks, and she is securing Northern Ireland&#8217;s future and leadership in a way that is unrivalled. As First Minister, she is truly exceptional. She has been through the worst of what Northern Ireland was associated with in the past and she is now at the helm, building what we in Northern Ireland hope to be associated with in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/4">When Arlene entered politics, she was directly affected by the troubles. Her school bus was blown up when she was a child, and her father, who served in the police, was shot. Arlene is no stranger to our dark days. With one eye looking to the past to learn and one eye firmly focused on the future, we have a real opportunity to make Northern Ireland better than ever. Arlene is living proof that gender is irrelevant and that equality in the workplace should be based on merit. She has merit in abundance.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/5">This is International Women&#8217;s Day, and there are many parts of the world in which women, ladies and girls do not have the necessary opportunities, whether in education or health, and in which they are often abused and raped, and end up being married at an early age. We need to be a voice for those people who are voiceless. We have two female First Ministers in the United Kingdom, as well as other female party leaders, and it is important to remember these advancements today and to resolve to build on them in the years ahead. We need to continue to harness such role models, whether in politics, business, academia or any other field, so that the glass ceiling can be firmly broken and we can live in a world that rewards solely on merit. It has been a pleasure to participate in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is day not only to celebrate women and their achievements, but to highlight what still needs to be done. I praise the Government for bringing forward policies that are helping to bring about balance and fairness for women.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/2">I will not reiterate everything that has been covered today and will cut to the chase and get to one of my main points, which is rather cosmetic, but it affects all women none the less. It is the thorny issue of ageing. I was tempted to don a grey wig to make this point today, but I believe that props are not allowed in this place. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Perhaps some are! Earlier in my career, I spent a lot of time as a television presenter and every day, like many women, I faced the reality of whether to show that I was growing older. The question was, &#8220;To grey or not to grey?&#8221; A woman showing signs of growing older, wrinkles and grey hair, is still perceived differently; not always, but it does happen, especially in the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/3">Yesterday, out of interest, I googled many of my colleagues in the House to see what questions were most asked about them on the internet. For all the women I googled, many of whom are here, the most-asked questions by the public were, &#8220;What is their age? What is their marital status? Do they have children?&#8221; I tried the same for male colleagues and&#8212;guess what?&#8212;not one of those questions was asked about any male MP. Is that not shocking? It seems that we are not rated on experience, wisdom, knowledge or achievements, which brings me to rather a grey note to finish on. A fine head of hair of that particular hue seems to be revered among the male fraternity. I give you the names of the silver fox, Mr Clooney, and Paul Hollywood and even our own Speaker. While a few revered women, such as our Home Secretary, have adopted the style, they are few and far between.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/4">To sum up, like it or not, admit it or not, there is huge pressure on women to conform to youthful ideals. I want to change that view and this House can help. That is what this day is all about. Let us speak up for the experience and wisdom that women bring to the table through work and, if they choose to do so, through bringing up children. Give them the reverence that they deserve. We should get away from the value judgments that are often made on the basis of our hair colour. Let us continue with the many policies that my party is putting in place to empower women and young girls, of which I have two, and let us continue to tackle all taboos.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.1/1">On around <phrase class="date" code="2016-06-22">22 June</phrase> this year, I am due to become a father for the first time. While it is not yet clear whether this baby girl&#8217;s middle name would best be Europa or Brexit, she will in due course become an international woman. Being born in Britain, she will over the course of her school and working life encounter opportunities that remain almost unimaginable for many born elsewhere. She will have a mother whose science and medical background will inspire her, or put her off, careers where women have traditionally been desperately under-represented, but her father&#8217;s jobs as a journalist and a politician may make her wonder why men are drawn to jobs in which the public do not believe a word that we say.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/2">However, girls born in Britain do not only face first-world problems. While it is sometimes unhelpful to talk about a sex war in which a strain of feminism aggressively alienates men, arguments about language and presentation should not obscure the facts: seven out of 10 women say that they have experienced harassment in the street; childcare still falls predominantly on women; and men who take advantage of the Government&#8217;s hugely positive changes to parental leave are likely to be a tiny percentage of the majority. Even in this place, while we talk about paternity leave, it is apparently beyond the wit of man or woman to sort out a system that works. I hope my naked self-interest does not invalidate the fact that as long as Parliament says that businesses must do as we say, not as we do, we will deserve to make little progress nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/3">International Women&#8217;s Day must surely be about one thing above all else: equality. It is about equality of opportunity for girls to study any subject they like and not those whose culture persists in saying that boys or girls specialise in certain subjects. It is about equality of access to their parents because society does not pretend that men have to go to work and women look after children. And it is about equality of access to the workplace, because it is time that we all acknowledged that men and women, Britain and the world benefit if we jointly celebrate diversity and difference, while acknowledging that each of us has strengths and that some of those may derive from gender as much as they do from background.</p>
	<p pid="a.234.1/4">I do not think that the pay gap will have closed by the time my daughter is born or even before she is working, nor do I pretend that we can have so much equality that men and women will ever be equal in bearing children, but I know that unless we all&#8212;men and women&#8212;have this inequality in mind, in this place and everywhere, we will not be able to lead by example or to ask those who think they have something to lose from equality to see what, in fact, they have to gain.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.0/1">As the token man on the Women and Equalities Committee until very recently, it has been very nice to be in a minority in some parts of this place, and I feel as though I have lit my own bra many a time in support of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/2">It is an absolute privilege to be called in this debate on this really important International Women&#8217;s Day. May I join in all the congratulatory comments to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11447" name="Dawn Butler">the hon.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase>, the Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee. No one has championed the equality of women more than her in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/3">I want to take this opportunity to concentrate on science, technology, engineering and maths&#8212;the STEM subjects&#8212;which have been a focus of my attention since I started in this place. The statistics are staggering and speak for themselves: a 2012 survey by Girlguiding of girls between the ages of seven and 21 found that the top three careers they would choose for themselves were teacher, hairdresser and beautician; only 3% of engineering degree applicants are girls and just 6% of the UK engineering workforce are female, according to the Women&#8217;s Engineering Society; and physics is the third most popular A-level for boys but only the 19th for girls. That simply has to change if we are to work towards a more gender equal society, and International Women&#8217;s Day is a perfect time to highlight this issue. I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Women and Equalities and Family Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24873" name="Caroline Dinenage">the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase> has spoken many a time about her passion for championing this case and the need today to end up reducing the silos within government. I pay tribute to her work and I hope that in her summing up she will be able to make that case a lot clearer.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.0/4">As a man, and as someone on the Select Committee, it is an absolute privilege to be able to call to arms every single man in this country to say that standing up and championing equal rights is not just a job for women, but a job for every single one of us&#8212;it is a job for every man in our country, too. That is why I am absolutely privileged to end up speaking in today&#8217;s International Women&#8217;s Day debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-08a.236.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25371" speakername="Maggie Throup" colnum="236"  time="018:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160308/debtext/160308-0003.htm#160308-0003.htm_spnew90">
	<p pid="a.236.0/1">I am delighted to be able to speak in this very important debate, partly because the issue is such an important one, but also because too many women do not have a voice. We have heard some moving speeches today, but I want to spend my time highlighting some great women in my constituency, who are all great role models.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/2">First, I wish to highlight three businesswomen: Caroline Steed, who exports her sofas across the world, including to China and Russia; Sheila Mason at Cluny Lace, which made the lace for the Duchess of Cambridgeshire&#8217;s wedding dress; and Sandra Lee, who just last Friday quadrupled the size of her gift shop. When it comes to educators, Joan McCarthy exudes enthusiasm to all her students in her role as head at Saint John Houghton Catholic Voluntary Academy. There are many more women teachers I could name as being outstanding, but I wish to mention a lady who plays an important part at one of my local schools, Chaucer Junior School&#8212;dinner lady Kerry Wheatley. Kerry does far more than just be a dinner lady; she runs the school&#8217;s gardening club and even takes students to the Chelsea flower show. But Kerry&#8217;s enthusiasm stretches even further than the dinner table or the garden; just last Friday she was instrumental in getting the students to clean for the Queen&#8212;another great lady.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/3">When we turn to charities and the voluntary sector, the list gets even longer. We have Holly Saunders who set up the Erewash Valley Gymnastics Club, which recently featured on the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;East Midlands Today&#8221; to raise awareness of the impact of obesity on young lives. Brenda Davies is chief executive of Community Concern Erewash. Stella Scott and Linda Brown play key roles at Erewash Voluntary Action and Joe and</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/4">Bren are dedicated to Home-Start Erewash. They all deserve recognition. However, we must never forget the women who dedicate many years to raising our future generations, so often sacrificing their careers in support of their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/5">We do not know what challenges those women had to overcome to play their roles in Erewash, but I can guarantee that they will have had to overcome some. By recognising and celebrating International Women&#8217;s Day here in this place, I believe that, in a small way, we are playing our part.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">Raped, beaten and destitute, Sarah had nowhere to go. Aged 28, and with her young son, she faced no option other than to leave her own home. Tom, her partner, had become increasingly violent over the past year, stripping her of her self-esteem. On one occasion, he had tried to push her out of an upstairs window. On another, she awoke at night to find that he had poured methylated spirits all over her, trying to set her alight. It stopped only when their young son saw what was happening and called the police. She had tried to leave over the years, but on every occasion Tom had persuaded her that he was a changed man and that he could not cope without her. One night, though, everything changed and she realised that she could not take any more. This is not a storyline in a soap opera; this was one of my clients when I was a barrister. I was instructed late one evening to apply to the court for an emergency order to get a judge to provide her with accommodation. The move was designed to provide her with a safe place and support for her son and to keep her away from the very real threat posed by Tom.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">Two women die at the hands of domestic abusers each week in England and Wales. On average, a woman will be assaulted 35 times before seeking help. In 2009, the cost to the UK economy was estimated to be &#163;15.7 million a year. Although we need to celebrate the achievements of women, we also need to pause and reflect on the areas in which, as those statistics show, women and girls are still being failed. Although words are important, it is action that will make a real difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">In March 2014, the Government introduced Clare&#8217;s law, which is named after Clare Wood, who was tragically murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009. The law allows people to ask the police whether their partner has a history of domestic abuse, and it has already helped more than 1,000 people. We have introduced new domestic violence protection orders that protect victims in the immediate aftermath of domestic violence, when they are at their most vulnerable. Domestic violence is not always physical. It can be psychological and emotional, which is why we have introduced a new offence of coercive and controlling behaviour. Of course, all those numbers mean nothing to women and girls who are still suffering abuse, and it is for them that I speak today. No one in this country should live with the threat of violence or in fear of harm.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.0/1">I look forward to the day when there is no longer any need for International Women&#8217;s Day; when &#8220;Woman tipped to become next M&amp;S boss announces she is taking maternity leave&#8221; is no longer a newsworthy headline for the <i>Daily Mail</i><i>; </i>when we have 50%, not 22%, of parliamentarians across the world being women, and we no longer feel any need to measure or report the statistic; and when we do not need to discuss how to encourage more young women into science and maths.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/2">Yes, we have come a long way. Government after Government have brought in legislation to ensure that we have equal treatment, but we are still striving for parity. Why is that? I do not profess to have the answers, but I recently read an article about a transgender person who had therefore experienced life as both a woman and a man. Ben Barres is a biologist at Stanford who lived and worked as Barbara Barres until he was in his 40s. He said that, as a woman, he often experienced bias, but when he became Ben he noticed a difference in his everyday experiences. He said that as a man, people treated him with much more respect. He noticed that he was more carefully listened to and his authority less frequently questioned. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/3">&#8220;The reasons why women are not breaking into academic jobs at any appreciable rate is not childcare, not family responsibilities.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/4">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/5">&#8220;I have had the thought a million times: I am now taken more seriously&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.0/6">So I welcome International Women&#8217;s Day, but I would welcome more a time when there is no need to celebrate it, when women are recognised and lauded for what we have done as individuals, not for our achievements as women.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.1/1">Today we celebrate International Women&#8217;s Day, an opportunity to celebrate great women and also to reflect on what more we can do as parliamentarians. It is true that there are more women in Parliament today than ever before, which is primarily why it is incumbent on us to take this opportunity to ensure equality across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/2">Women&#8217;s rights are human rights, yet when it comes to employment, women repeatedly suffer discrimination. We have seen Women Against State Pension Inequality campaigning vigorously for transitional arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.3/1">Absolutely. I would wholeheartedly welcome an announcement in the Budget next week that the Government will make transitional arrangements for those women.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/2">We have heard about the issues of pensions, employment and domestic violence. I recognise the powerful contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase>, which highlighted the fact that too many women lose their life to violence every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/3">On welfare, more women than men are lone parents and carers, a fact that must be recognised. The Government must ensure support for those women. There are many gaps that need to be addressed before we have full gender parity. I have called on the Prime Minister to take five key actions for International Women&#8217;s Day. First, the rape clause in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill must be scrapped. A woman who has a third child as a result of rape will be required to justify her position to a Government official in order to claim tax credits. That proposal is abhorrent. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25327" name="Alison Thewliss">the Member for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss)</phrase>, who has campaigned tirelessly against it, and I support her efforts unequivocally. I hope the Government will remove that barbaric proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/4">I have urged the Prime Minister to ratify the Istanbul convention and to take serious action to tackle violence against women. Every day in the UK, women lose their life to physical violence. Ratification of the treaty would not only co-ordinate the policies of Government, local authorities and charities, but would send a clear message that the UK is committed to tackling all forms of violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/5">The tampon tax must be scrapped. Labelling women&#8217;s sanitary products a luxury item is ridiculous. Those items are a necessity, so an additional VAT charge is wrong. Instead of the Government forcing the European Commission&#8217;s hand to lift the unfair tax, women will continue to pay that charge, and as a result continue to pay for their own services. We must remove that unfair tax, and the UK Government must use the money to support services.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/6">We must also take firm action on the gender pay gap. The Scottish Government have committed to 50:50 by 2020, to encourage public sector, third sector and private sector companies to ensure equality on boards. The Scottish Government plan to legislate to ensure that public authorities with more than 20 employees will publish information on that. I hope the UK Government will consider that, as the current threshold of 250 employees is not good enough to tackle the gender pay gap as they hope it will.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/7">Unlawful maternity and pregnancy discrimination is more common in Britain&#8217;s workplaces than ever before, with many women being forced out of their employment. The Government are trying to help people into work, yet they are introducing employment tribunal fees that may be a barrier to many women tackling rogue employers. The Government must look at those fees and challenge discrimination in all its forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/8">I have presented those five points to the Prime Minister. We need deeds, not words, and I urge the Government to take those recommendations on board. As parliamentarians, let us be bold in delivering the kind of society we want to achieve&#8212;a more equal future for everyone. Let us deliver it&#8212;it is possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.239.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the right hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11447" name="Dawn Butler">the Member for Brent Central (Dawn Butler)</phrase> on securing today&#8217;s debate. I also thank the Backbench Business Committee for making time available for it and all the Members who have participated, women and men, for their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">The debate has been an important opportunity to celebrate women&#8217;s achievements and share in an ambition that exists around the world to achiever gender equality, not only as a matter of justice to women but as a prerequisite for a successful, prosperous and peaceful future for our world. Equality for women is not a zero-sum game that means men must lose out if women do well. Whenever women are poor, insecure and unsafe or disempowered, everyone suffers&#8212;families, children and communities. When women do well, by contrast, society thrives; health, educational attainment and economic performance all improve. That is why our ambition of gender equality in every country is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/3">Of course, we have made great strides forward, especially here in the UK. Women are achieving educationally, professionally and in public life in ways that our grandmothers could not have dreamed of. More women occupy senior positions in business, in the professions and in sport, as we heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25332" name="Christina Rees">the Member for Neath (Christina Rees)</phrase>. We have choices that were denied to previous generations of women.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.1/1">I will not, if my hon. Friend will forgive me, because I am very short of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/2">As we have heard today, there is still a long way to go. There is a long way to go on economic equality, as we heard from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10402" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10381" name="Siobhain McDonagh">the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25421" name="Paula Sherriff">the Member for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff)</phrase>, who talked about gender pricing, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25343" name="Ruth Cadbury">the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ruth Cadbury)</phrase>, who talked about the importance of our membership of the European Union in protecting women&#8217;s economic position, and many other hon. Members. We heard about the gender pay gap, which is nearly 20% higher in this country than the European average, and about the average apprenticeship wage for young women being more than &#163;1 lower than it is for young men. We heard about women being trapped in low-paid sectors such as catering, caring and retail. We heard from many hon. Members about the disproportionate representation of men in STEM jobs, and we heard that the disadvantage that women experience in the labour market feeds into their poverty in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/3">No one who was in the Chamber this afternoon can have failed to be moved and appalled by the names read out by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase> of women who are among the two killed every week in this country by a partner or former partner. We heard from hon. Members throughout the House of many other appalling examples of gender-based violence. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25272" name="Suella Fernandes">the hon. Member for Fareham (Suella Fernandes)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Member for Slough, who talked about the violence endemic in prostitution, and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24860" name="Jake Berry">the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Jake Berry)</phrase>, who talked about breast ironing, a new and horrific form of abuse that has arrived in this country. We also heard about female genital mutilation. Although we did not hear much about this today, we should also remember the special circumstances of lesbian and transgender women who suffer appalling gender-based violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10228" name="Cheryl Gillan">The right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25354" name="Nusrat Ghani">the hon. Member for Wealden (Nusrat Ghani)</phrase> rightly talked about cyber-abuse. I join <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10063" name="Tom Brake">the right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> in urging the Government once again to consider introducing compulsory sex and relationships education.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/5">May I make a special mention of the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10559" name="Caroline Spelman">the right hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman)</phrase>, who spoke up for detained refugee women? Their plight in a civilised country is something that shames all of us. I was proud to sit in this Chamber this afternoon and hear her speak out on behalf of those women. It is a cause that we must continue to champion together.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/6">We also heard that this Parliament has, pleasingly, seen the highest level of representation of women that we have ever had. However, as many hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24852" name="Valerie Vaz">the hon. Member for Eastleigh, my hon. Friends the Members for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz)</phrase> and for Heywood and Middleton (Liz McInnes) and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25424" name="Victoria Atkins">the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins)</phrase>, said, we still have some way to go. When just 29% of our MPs are women, it is clear that our Parliament continues to fall a long way short of reflecting the population of our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/7">Given the contributions that we have heard this afternoon, I am pleased that the sustainable development goals, to which we, along with all other countries, are signatories, include a goal dedicated to gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment. The sustainable development goals are not just for developing economies but apply to every country, including the UK. As we celebrate International Women&#8217;s Day, we recognise that the challenges women face here at home are the same as those faced by our sisters everywhere. For sure, there are differences of degree, but not differences of kind. We have heard some shocking examples&#8212;the plight of the Yazidi women, women in Saudi Arabia and the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram&#8212;but the pattern of poverty, inequality, inadequate representation and gender-based violence exists in every country. As the challenges are the same worldwide, we can learn from and support each other to achieve solutions. We can work together to ensure that we embed gender equality into every aspect of our policy and practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/8">I know that the Minister shares my passion for gender equality, and I am sure she will take the opportunity today to reaffirm the Government&#8217;s commitment to systematically addressing gender inequality, wherever and whenever it arises. As we sign up to the vital sustainable development goals, I hope she will say that they will shape and underpin policy right across Government &#8212;both domestic policy and the way we use our influence and share learning with others internationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/9">I also hope that Members will today affirm our determination that this debate will take place every International Women&#8217;s Day&#8212;in this Chamber and in Government time, as the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham suggested, in solidarity with our sisters around the world and as a measure of our resolve to place gender equality at the heart of our politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.1/10">In conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker, may I take this opportunity to wish you, all right hon. and hon. Members, and our sisters and brothers around the world a happy International Women&#8217;s Day?</p>

	<p pid="a.242.0/1">May I, too, start by congratulating the right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House who secured the debate? I congratulate everybody who has taken part. We have had outstanding and excellent speeches from male and female Members from across the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/2">I am pleased to be able to chart the significant progress that has been made under the Government. There are now more women in work than ever before. There are more women on boards than ever before. There are no all-male FTSE 100 boards. There are more women- led businesses than ever before&#8212;about 1 million small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK are women-led. The gender pay gap is the lowest on record and has virtually been eliminated among full-time workers under the age of 40. While it is important to celebrate how much progress we have made, we must be clear that, in today&#8217;s society, there is no place for any pay gap. The theme of this year&#8217;s International Women&#8217;s Day is the pledge for parity, and I am delighted the Prime Minister has pledged to close the gender pay gap within a generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/3">It is vital to the Government that our economy benefits from the talents of everyone, and that everyone is able to fulfil their potential in the workplace, regardless of gender or background, so this year the Government are taking a bold step. We will redouble our efforts to complete the fight for equality, starting with the introduction of regulations to require large employers to publish their gender pay gaps. By working with businesses and employees, with a focus on transparency, I am confident that we will begin to see results.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/4">The gender pay gap usually starts in the type of work that women do in the sectors in which they typically end up. As we have heard in some of today&#8217;s excellent speeches, occupational segregation is particularly apparent in the science, technology, engineering and maths sectors, where jobs carry a significant wage premium, but a shortage of girls and women are entering them and working their way to the top. We are working closely with schools and businesses to deliver initiatives such as the STEM diversity programme to address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/5">Crucially, our work on girls&#8217; aspirations is about dispelling the myth that there are girls&#8217; jobs and boys&#8217; jobs. There are, simply, just jobs. Last year we published guidance entitled &#8220;Your Daughter's Future&#8221;, which empowers parents and teachers to support girls in making decisions about subject and career choices, free from gender stereotypes.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/6">There is also much more that we can do to support women in their careers and in achieving their potential. Women now lead about 20% of UK small businesses, which are the lifeblood of our economy, yet they are still setting up businesses at about half the rate of their male counterparts. The Women&#8217;s Business Council estimates that if women started businesses at the same rate as men, there would be 1 million extra businesses, yet research tells us that many women say that they lack the confidence, or perceive themselves to lack the necessary skills, to be able to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/7">We must not let the fear of failure hold back talented female budding entrepreneurs from achieving their full potential. That is why we continue to fund the &#163;1 million women and broadband programme, which has been incredibly successful. In fact, many of our women and broadband projects across the country, from Durham to Devon, are themselves celebrating International Women&#8217;s Day.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/8">We have also endeavoured to address the issues that are most pertinent to women in work. From the introduction of the right to request flexible working, to shared parental leave, we are helping women to achieve a better balance between work and motherhood. Realistically, however, women&#8217;s caring responsibilities rarely end when their own children fly the nest. The challenge of balancing care with a fulfilling career can often become most acute in the later stages of a woman&#8217;s working life, whether they are caring for an elderly relative or for grandchildren. Let us not forget the remarkable sandwich generation, either, who are somehow doing both. We need to find ways to support them all. That is why the Women&#8217;s Business Council has established a working group on older workers and will consider what business can do to support them. We have also invested money in nine pilots across England to explore ways to support carers to balance work and caring responsibilities. When we talk to women&#8212;and men&#8212;it is clear that, on work-life balance, childcare is the most important issue. That is why we are investing more than &#163;1 billion more a year on free childcare places.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/9">Turning to parity of representation in politics and public life, we come full circle. We know just how valuable female role models can be to young girls and women&#8212;raising aspiration is vital to the talent pipeline. We all take great pride in being part of the most gender diverse Parliament in British history. The Government are committed to improving the public appointments process and have set an aspiration that 50% of new appointments should go to women.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/10">Equality, however, is about more than just economic parity&#8212;protecting women and girls from violence, and supporting victims, are also key priorities. The list of murdered women at the hands of domestic violence that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase> read out earlier makes that argument more powerfully than any speech. I wholeheartedly agree with her that the voices of those murdered women must remain at the forefront of effective Government policy making. Our new violence against women and girls strategy, which was published today, will focus on service transformation and prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/11">We are also working with partners such as the PSHE Association to ensure that schools have access to safe, effective and high-quality resources. We have launched the next phase of our teen relationship abuse campaign, Disrespect NoBody, which encourages young people to think about their views on violence. We have funded the revenge porn helpline and the Freedom charity, which educates schoolchildren and their teachers about forced marriage.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/12">We have made significant progress since 2010, including by criminalising forced marriage and revenge porn, as well as strengthening the law on domestic violence. We have strengthened the law on female genital mutilation so that it includes mandatory reporting and introducing FGM protection orders.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.1/1">I thank all the participants in the debate and the Backbench Business Committee for the time that it allocated. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">The right hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase> touched on the battle&#8212;it was a bit of battle, I must say&#8212;that we had to ensure that the debate was held in the Chamber. I took a deep breath when it was suggested that we hold the debate in Westminster Hall, although <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25330" name="Mims Davies">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mims Davies)</phrase> was a little more generous than me&#8212;subtlety was never one of my strong points. The number of Members from both sides of the House who have spoken today, on International Women&#8217;s Day 2016, in this passionate debate showed that we were right to hold the debate here in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" name="Jess Phillips">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)</phrase> highlighted the women who have been killed by men since International Women&#8217;s Day 2015, reading out 121 names. Internationally, five women are killed every hour, so during this debate 15 women have been murdered. That is a sobering thought. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24796" name="Helen Grant">The hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant)</phrase> talked about Boko Haram and the &#8220;Bring Back Our Girls&#8221; campaign, and said that there would be a renewed emphasis on that issue. We must never forget the women and girls who have been murdered, killed or kidnapped, or who are still missing.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25421" name="Paula Sherriff">the Member for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff)</phrase> highlighted the gender differentials. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25166" name="Stephen Doughty">the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty)</phrase> mentioned the Yazidi women who have been captured and raped. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10402" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> mentioned prostitution and trafficked women, and she talked about the motion. The motion took a while to write, because so many issues could have been included that it was difficult to know what to focus on. A common theme that has come out of the debate is that the abuse of women is always used as a weapon of war. Whether it be in gangs, wars or other violence, women and young girls are always used and raped. We must never, ever forget that.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4">I have a little bit of a confession to make. Last night, I was thinking about the Chancellor in bed&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> It is true. I was thinking that he has a deleterious effect on women, and I am fearful about next week&#8217;s Budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.3/1">Absolutely. We have to do more on the transitional arrangements for women. The situation is not fair and it is just not right.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/2">As I say, I worry about the Budget next week. It sometimes seems as though revenge is being taken against women, because 81% of the cuts made in this Parliament will affect women. In UK households, 744,000 individuals are on zero-hours contracts, and the majority of those people are women. In 2007, 62,700 equal pay claims were made. We all know, as has been said in the debate, that women are not being treated better at work, but only 9,621 equal pay claims were made in 2014-15, because of the changes that have been made to the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/3">Twenty per cent. of small and medium-sized enterprises are led by women. Women often start their own businesses to ensure that their worth is acknowledged, and the number who do so increases every single year. Forty-nine per cent. of lone parents are on prepayment meters, which means that they pay more, and that contributes to household debt. Guess what? The majority of lone parents are women. As I have said, 744,000 people are on zero-hours contracts, and the majority of them are women. Would it not be great if we could outlaw zero-hours contracts in this Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/4">We in this House have a duty to ensure that we make laws that are not harmful to women. We have to empower women in this place; that is our duty. As has been mentioned, PSHE is an important part of education. It sets the foundation in schools, from a very early age, for constructive relationships. In my opinion, it should be compulsory.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/5">I thank the House for the way in which the debate has been conducted, and I thank the Backbench Business Committee again for granting it.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/7" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="a.244.3/8">That this House expresses its solidarity with International Women&#8217;s Day; notes with concern that, despite women making up 51 per cent of society as a whole, more progress needs to be made in electing women to Parliament, as well as in establishing equal pay and parity between men and women in positions of leadership; and calls for greater action against FGM and other practices that are harmful to women.</p>

What advice can you give me about talking to the relevant authorities to ensure that, in the future, we are able to secure an even longer debate? We are grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for supporting today&#8217;s debate, but I think that there is a great case to be made for having even longer to discuss an issue that is relevant to every single Member of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.2/1">We have just had a good debate on International Women&#8217;s Day and we are about to discuss nuclear power, so I would like in one sentence to remember Marie Curie, who did all the basic work on radioactivity, Lise Meitner, who discovered uranium fission, and a lady who hon.

This debate is not about arguments for and against nuclear power; it is about the fact that the Government have been keeping Parliament in the dark&#8212;I use that word advisedly&#8212;on the crisis in the EDF board. I heard the Minister of State speaking on the radio this morning. She gave the usual line that it will be all right on the night, but it will not.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.6/1">If my hon. Friend has been reading the French media over the past few days he will know that it is not just the French unions. Practically the entire French media are now referring to Hinkley Point and the EPR reactor as the &#8220;English threat&#8221; to EDF.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.6/2">Hinkley is the biggest power project we have ever seen, at &#163;25 billion and rising. Under our current energy plan we are dependent on it to deliver 7% of the UK&#8217;s generation capacity, at a moment when our capacity margins are close to zero. Having mortgaged the UK&#8217;s energy future to Hinkley C, the Government have failed consistently to keep Parliament informed about the crisis on the EDF board, up to and including last weekend when the person in charge of the company&#8217;s finances&#8212;the chief financial officer&#8212;was in effect forced to resign because of his resistance to going ahead with this project.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.6/3">If a major UK engineering company had a contract with the Government, and its chief financial officer was opposed to that contract and was fired, imagine the scandal there would be. However, the Government are happy to stay quiet while the senior management of EDF are removed in order for the project to go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.1/1">I am aware of that&#8212;that is the problem. Why is there a revolt on the board? It is not just the trade union members. It is true that a third of the EDF board is allocated to union members, union representatives and staff representatives. They are in favour of nuclear power, but they are worried about the impact on the company&#8217;s future. Why is there a vote? Why was the chief financial officer against this? EDF has a negative cash flow. Its debts are twice its company valuation. Its share price has halved in the past 12 months. How is it paying its dividend? It is doing so by issuing more shares and giving them to the shareholders. Imagine how insane that is.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.3/1">I think the hon. Gentleman has summed up the incredible state we have got ourselves into. Somehow, it will be all right on the night. Somehow, the French Government are going to bail out the United Kingdom&#8217;s energy policy. I can assure Conservative Members that that is not going to happen. What is going to happen is the following: at some point, I suspect with pressure from the British Government, what is left of EDF&#8217;s board and senior management will override the resistance of the minority on the board and green light construction. They will green light construction at a point where EDF cannot guarantee it has the funds to complete building the reactor. At some point, there will be a crisis and who is going to pick up the pieces? I can assure the House that it will be the United Kingdom taxpayer, not the French taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.0/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. Originally, the two Hinkley C reactors were designed to be off-the-shelf copies of the reactor being built by EDF in Normandy. That has not happened. There have been significant changes. In fact, the way the EPR reactor has to be built&#8212;on site, piece by piece; it will be unique&#8212;leaves massive margins of error for cost overrun. Who is underwriting any cost overruns? The Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a partial capital guarantee that if there is any problem in the construction phase, the British taxpayer will start to pick up the bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.2/1">Yes, that is entirely true. That is the point. If we look at who is actually responsible for having got us into this financial hole, do I detect yet again that it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer? We are here not out of an energy policy issue, but because the Chancellor wanted to keep the construction costs of &#163;25 billion and rising off the national book. He wanted to keep it off the debt. For the first time ever in the UK, we are trying to build a new reactor with a new reactor design by putting all the risk on to the private sector. This project is too large and the technology is too unproven for that to work. The Chancellor is digging himself a big hole to protect his rickety plan to keep down the deficit and pay down the national debt, but it will not work. At some point in the next 10 years, we will be back here discussing a bail-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/2">That is what I am trying to get across. A significant number of EDF board members know that the project cannot be financed through private capital. Even if EDF could raise the &#163;12 billion or &#163;18 billion&#8212;its share for building the Hinkley C reactor&#8212;it would need four, five or six times that to complete its programme of reactor life extensions in France. The sum total is colossal for a company already dripping with debt. Unless the French taxpayer is prepared to underwrite all of that, which is highly unlikely, something will have to give, and let me assure the House that it will be not EDF&#8217;s reactors in France but this project. It will disappear into the wide blue yonder.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/3">The problem is that by 2025, when the two reactors are not on-stream, we will have closed down the 10 coal- fired stations that the Government announced would be closed last November, just before the Paris climate change conference, and suddenly we will have a huge gap in the 2020s&#8212;even worse than now&#8212;in our capacity to generate electricity. That will all be because we have mortgaged ourselves to an outdated approach to energy, which is to build gargantuan nuclear reactors that cost the earth&#8212;literally and financially&#8212;and which cannot be underwritten by the private sector because of the risk. The Government have manifestly been trying to pretend otherwise, and that is ultimately why they are refusing to come back regularly to the House to explain what is going on. They are hoping for the best.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.2/4">I want the Minister to tell us what discussions have been going on with the board, when we might see the decision to go ahead with construction and what will happen if we do not get a timely agreement to go ahead. What happens if the board delays and delays until 2019? Is there a plan B?</p>

	<p pid="a.251.1/1">Of course, the strike price is subject to certain qualifications. Were EDF to build the reactors and make a vast profit&#8212;the strike price is more than twice the current cost of electricity and there is an increment for inflation&#8212;there would be a clawback. If it makes a profit beyond what was originally envisaged, some of the money would come back to the British taxpayer. The clawback was insisted upon and enlarged by the European Commission, so it was interesting listening to the Minister this morning on the radio, given her position on the UK leaving the EU. It was in fact the Commission that tried to stand up for the British consumer. That is one reason I will be voting to stay in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.3/1">I cavil at the word &#8220;incompetent&#8221;. The board&#8217;s decision has become politically charged. That is the point. The UK Government are desperate to continue with the project because everything is hitched to it and because it keeps the cost of building Hinkley C theoretically off the books&#8212;although it cannot remain so in the long run&#8212;and the French Government are committed to it because EDF is in a major financial crisis and they want to protect its reputation and give it a chance to grow out of its problems. If we make such decisions political, however, we make bad decisions&#8212;that is my point. It is strange that I have to lecture the Conservative Government on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.3/2">Some of the senior management of EDF, knowing the difficulties, want to delay and want to get the funding in place. It was because the chief officer wanted the funding in place that they got rid of him. How can that be so? Aside from politics and differences on nuclear power, cannot the Government and the Department of Energy and Climate Change see the problems that they are getting themselves into?

	<p pid="a.252.0/1">Both the Flamanville reactor and the reactor in Finland have run into trouble. The EPR reactor was designed to be super safe, but it involved loading technology on top of technology, with the result that it has to be built in situ. It cannot be built, as other reactor models can, in the factory with bits getting moved in. Building in situ means that each and every single EPR has been different and that the economies of scale that were meant to make the projects cost-effective have gone. That is why it is becoming very difficult for EDF to raise the money commercially to do the funding. The technology is questionable, the funding is questionable and there is Government interference.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/2">All I am saying ultimately is that this Parliament needs regular updating in an honest and serious way so that we know where we are. We also need a plan B because this antediluvian and obsolete method of approaching how to fund large-scale and huge energy projects by putting all the eggs in one basket runs a risk. Perhaps because the Government are frightened to own up to that risk, they hide&#8212;and if they hide, it just means that the problem will be even greater in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.1/1">In the same tone as the hon. Gentleman, I would like to draw attention on International Women&#8217;s Day to the fact that Dame Sue Ion was on &#8220;Desert Island Discs&#8221; as the first woman to be awarded the very prestigious president&#8217;s medal by the Royal Academy of Engineering and she is herself a nuclear expert. I am sure that all hon. Members will be delighted to hear that today of all days.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25325" name="George Kerevan">the hon. Member for East Lothian (George Kerevan)</phrase> for securing this debate, which gives me the opportunity to put forward the Government&#8217;s vision for Hinkley Point C. HPC is a matter of national importance for our energy system, and it is only right that it should be discussed in this House. However, let me point out that we do not put all our eggs in one basket. Far from being the only game in town, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, it is part of a balanced mix of energy sources that includes renewables and fossil fuels. It is absolutely vital that we stick to our plan for energy security and decarbonising at the lowest price to consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/3">Returning to HPC, there are numerous approvals processes for a project like it, many of which have already been completed. These include state aid; the approval of a funded decommissioning programme to cover the costs of managing waste from HPC, which is included in the contract for difference; planning approval; and grid connection. Some other processes will continue up to signature of the documents. Looking ahead, HPC will need to comply with the UK&#8217;s robust nuclear regulations&#8212;among the most stringent and safest in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/4">However, the key to this project is the funding package that has been negotiated with the developer. It is this, I think, that the hon. Gentleman had in mind when calling for this debate, and I intend to focus my remarks on it. The short answer to the question he raised is that the timing of Government&#8217;s final approval of the deal is dependent on EDF being in a position to make a final investment decision. As he is aware, this is ultimately a commercial matter for EDF. In the UK, it is for developers to fund, build and operate new nuclear power stations. I would like to take this opportunity to explain what this Government are doing to expedite the successful conclusion of this landmark deal.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.1/1">I shall not give way for a while; I am slightly short of time and I have important points to make. I will give way later if there is time.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/2">Let me first remind the House of the reasons why the Government have supported the development of Hinkley Point C, and how we have ensured that this is a good deal for Britain. New nuclear is needed, alongside renewables and fossil fuels, because nuclear is the only non-renewable low-carbon technology that is currently proven and can be deployed on a large scale to provide continuous supply. Most existing nuclear plants, which currently meet about 16% of our energy needs, are due to close by the late 2020s. Without new nuclear build, the share of nuclear generation could dip to 3% in 2030. Britain is a world leader in civil nuclear, through our skills base, our infrastructure and our regulatory regime. Hinkley Point C will keep Britain at the forefront of nuclear development.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/3">Government policy has determined that the new plant should be financed and built by the private sector. The Government have worked closely with new-build vendors and industry to develop a number of initiatives to maximise both the capability and the economic benefits to the UK. That goes far wider than Hinkley Point C&#8212;industry has set out proposals to develop 18 GW of new nuclear power in the UK&#8212;but the first step in this long-term plan is Hinkley, which will be the first new nuclear power plant to be built in the UK for 20 years, and which will blaze a trail for further nuclear development.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/4">Once it is up and running in 2025, Hinkley will provide 3.2 GW of secure, base-load and low carbon electricity for at least 60 years, meeting 7% of the UK's energy needs. That is enough to power 6 million homes, twice as many as there are in the whole of London. Hinkley will give an enormous boost to both the local and the national economy, providing 25,000 jobs during construction, as well as 1,000 apprenticeships. The plant will provide employment for 900 permanent staff once it is up and running, contributing &#163;40 million a year to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/5">Having visited Bridgwater recently, I can tell the House that there is a real sense of excitement about the project. EDF has not been complacent; it is digging away. It has back runs, and the whole site has been levelled. There is big investment in the local community, and local people are very supportive of the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/6">EDF believes that at least 60% of the &#163;18 billion value of construction work on Hinkley will go to UK-based businesses. Through our negotiations, we have ensured that consumers will not pay anything for the electricity until the plant is generating, so the risks of construction will be transferred to the developer. At the same time, we have ensured that mechanisms are in place to enable any construction underspends or profits above a certain level to be shared with consumers. If the project comes in under budget, savings will be shared with consumers, but if there are overspends, the developer will bear all the additional costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/7">As I have said, we need new nuclear, and Hinkley Point C will pave the way for a new generation of nuclear plants in the UK in a cost-competitive way, thanks to the unique deal that we have negotiated.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/1">In the context of that &#8220;unique deal&#8221;, may I ask the Minister, as the final decision approaches, for a cast-iron guarantee from the Government that the strike price of &#163;92.50 will not be increased?</p>

	<p pid="a.254.1/1">As I have explained, the strike price has been agreed, and we expect a final investment decision in the very near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.1/2">The deal has already been through a number of rigorous approvals processes, both within the Government and within the European Union. In October 2013, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and EDF agreed the strike price for the electricity to be produced by Hinkley Point C. In October 2014, the European Commission approved the Hinkley Point C state aid case, following a lengthy and rigorous investigation by the Commission. Notwithstanding the ongoing opposition of a small minority of member states, we are confident that the decision is legally robust and will stand up to challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.1/3">In October 2015, EDF and its partner of 30 years, China General Nuclear, signed a strategic investment agreement in London. That commercial agreement set out the terms of EDF's partnership in the UK with CGN, starting with Hinkley Point C. EDF and CGN agreed to take a 66.5% stake and a 33.5% stake in Hinkley respectively. At that point, the final form of the contracts was agreed in substance. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made it clear at the time that she would make her final decision on Hinkley once EDF had reached its final investment decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.1/4">The Government&#8217;s position has remained unchanged while the final details of the contracts have been ironed out. In November, we set out that we expected to conclude the deal in the coming months, and the Secretary of State made it clear that she was minded to proceed with the contract for difference support package for the deal, subject to any change in circumstances. We remain confident that all parties are firmly behind Hinkley Point C and are working hard towards a final investment decision. We have received assurances from EDF and the French Government&#8212;EDF&#8217;s largest shareholder&#8212;on this point. Hinkley is a large investment for EDF and CGN, so it is only right and proper that they take the necessary time now to ensure that everything is in order so that they can proceed smoothly once they have taken a positive final investment decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.3/1">I hear my hon. Friend, and I can tell him that we are ready and keen to proceed as soon as EDF announces its final investment decision. However, this is a commercial matter, and it is for EDF to finance Hinkley Point C and to deliver that final investment decision. We are aware of the financial issues it is dealing with, and we remain in regular contact with the corporate leadership of EDF and with the French</p>
	<p pid="a.254.3/2">Government. We have been assured by both that they are taking the necessary steps to reach a final investment decision as soon as possible. We are confident that this is a matter of when, not if. Specifically, we have been reassured that the resignation of the EDF finance director will have no impact on the timing of EDF&#8217;s final investment decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.1/2">Last <phrase class="date" code="2016-03-03">Thursday, 3 March</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister met President Hollande at the UK-French summit in Amiens, France. The French Government gave a public commitment that EDF is currently working to take a final investment decision in the near future, with the full support of the French Government. We expect that a final investment decision can be achieved within a few weeks. Once EDF announces that it has taken a final investment decision, all parties will be in a position to sign the contracts and detailed investment documents within a matter of weeks. EDF&#8217;s chief executive officer, Jean-Bernard L&#233;vy, has also reassured us that EDF is still on track to pour the first concrete at the Hinkley site in 2019 and to start generating electricity in 2025.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.0/1">The Minister spoke earlier about safety. At Sellafield, engineers estimate that it will cost about &#163;50 billion over the next 100 years to clear up buildings B30 and B38.

	<p pid="a.256.1/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that that is a completely different matter. I see him nodding his head&#8212;he knows he is being mischievous. He also knows that the full cost of decommissioning Hinkley point C is included in the contract for difference&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is included. It is a requirement of new nuclear to have a fully costed decommissioning programme included in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.1/2">The Government remain committed to conducting this deal in an open and transparent manner.

This is a good deal for the British public, and it is one that the UK Government remain committed to. I thoroughly commend the project to all Members of this House.</p>
