	<p pid="b.160.6/1">While we do not record the proportion of patients waiting a week for their GP appointment, the latest GP patient survey results show that 85% of patients reported that they were able to get an appointment to see or speak to someone, and only a very small percentage ended up not speaking to or seeing someone.</p>

	<p pid="b.160.7/1">Unfortunately, many of my constituents would not recognise the picture that the Secretary of State seeks to paint.

	<p pid="b.160.8/1">If I may gently say so, the under-investment in general practice has been going on for decades, according to the BMA and the Royal College of GPs. We have announced that we are putting that right with our plans to recruit 5,000 more GPs during this Parliament. That is the biggest increase in GPs in the history of the NHS, with &#163;1 billion going to upgrade GP and primary care premises, and 18 million people by the end of this financial year benefiting from evening and weekend appointments. That is a big, positive change, and I hope she would welcome it.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.0/1">Has my right hon. Friend had a chance to read the report by the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care, which says that pressure would be taken off doctors and nurses if greater use were made of the 63,000 practitioners that it regulates on 17 separate registers covering 25 occupations?

	<p pid="b.161.1/1">I am very happy to do that. My hon. Friend is right to point out that the solution to the problem is not just about expanding the number of appointments offered by GPs, although we are doing that; it is also about looking at the very important role that pharmacists and other allied health professionals have to play in out-of-hospital care.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.2/1">The Secretary of State mentions recruiting 5,000 extra GPs, but I note in a recent speech that that was downgraded from a guarantee to a maximum. With 10% of trainee posts unfilled and the BMA&#8217;s recent survey suggesting that a third of GPs will leave in the next five years, is that not going to be difficult? Has the Secretary of State had any consultation with the BMA and the royal college to ask why they are leaving?</p>

	<p pid="b.161.3/1">It will be difficult. The commitment has never been downgraded: we always said that we needed about 10,000 more primary care staff, about half of whom we expected to be GPs. We have had extensive discussions about the issues surrounding general practice, such as burn-out, the contractual conditions and bureaucracy. We are looking at all of those things. The commitment is to increase the number of GPs by about 5,000 during the course of the Parliament, and that is a very important part of our plan to renew NHS care arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.4/1">I assume the Secretary of State is aware that two of the pilot sites for the seven-day, 8 till 8 working&#8212;one in north Yorkshire and the other in County Durham&#8212;have abandoned the project due to poor uptake by patients, with only 50% of appointments used on a Saturday and only 12% on a Sunday. Given that they found that it had a detrimental effect on recruiting cover for out-of-hours GP urgent services, does not he feel that this needs a rethink and that consultation with the profession and looking at cover would be of most benefit?</p>

	<p pid="b.161.5/1">The hon. Lady is presenting only a partial picture. In Slough there are about 900 more appointments every week as a result of the initiative for evening and weekend appointments. Birmingham has dramatically reduced the number of no-shows and Watford has reduced A&amp;E attendance measurably. Some really exciting things have happened, but of course we will continue to consult the profession to make sure that the programme works.</p>

There is huge enthusiasm for transforming the situation in Devon. It is a very challenged economy, but by bringing together the health and social care system and by putting more resources into primary and out-of-hospital care we will be able to give a better service to my hon.

	<p pid="b.162.1/2">The latest GP patient survey is important for the simple reason that it covers the first full year of the Government&#8217;s GP access challenge fund. The results do not make good reading for the Secretary of State. The percentage of patients dissatisfied with their surgery&#8217;s opening hours has increased and patients found it harder to get appointments last year than the year before. Will the Secretary of State admit that his policies are simply not working and that GP services are getting worse on his watch?</p>

	<p pid="b.162.2/2">I do not accept the picture the right hon. Gentleman paints of general practice. The Prime Minister&#8217;s challenge fund has been extremely successful: by the end of this year, 18 million people will be benefiting from the opportunity to have evening, weekend and Skype appointments with their GP. We have also announced the biggest increase in the number of GPs in the history of the NHS. The Labour party left us with a GP contract that ripped the heart out of general practice by removing responsibility for evening and weekend care and by getting rid of personal responsibility by GPs for their patients.

	<p pid="b.162.3/1">People who have been ringing surgeries this morning unable to get appointments will not be convinced by what they have just heard. The truth is that the disarray in the Secretary of State&#8217;s primary care policy goes much deeper. Not only has he made it harder for people to get a convenient appointment, but he now wants to charge people who miss the appointments they are able to get. We all want to reduce waste, but there are many reasons why people do not turn up, including family emergencies. That is presumably why No. 10 slapped him down. He will have worried people, so for the avoidance of doubt, will he today confirm that he will not return to that idea in this Parliament?</p>

We have recruited 8,000 more nurses into our hospitals because we have learned the lessons of the Francis report. The important lesson in the report is that it is not simply about the number of nurses; it is about the culture in hospitals and making sure that nurses are supported to give the best care. We want to learn those lessons as well.</p>

Gentleman knows from the debates we have had on the subject, it is a difficult area and there is no consistent evidence of adverse effects from low to moderate pre-natal alcohol consumption. I have talked this through with the chief medical officer: we have to get the balance right between warning women and responding to the important stats the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, without causing unnecessary worry for the around 50% of women who do not plan their pregnancy and might have drunk alcohol before they realised they were pregnant.</p>

From the very top of the game at FIFA and UEFA down to club boardrooms, fans have little representation.

Many have talked about empowering fans, but when I have asked how that can be done, no one has had the answers. What do they mean when they say that they want to empower fans, to give them representation on club boards, or to give them the power to buy shares?

One hundred per cent. responded positively to the question, &#8220;Should fans have more influence over the way their club is run?&#8221; Around 85% agreed that fans should be represented on club boards, and 97% said that supporters&#8217; organisations were not given significant recognition by those involved in the governance of the game.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/5">In July 2011, in its report on football governance, under the section headed, &#8220;A way forward for supporter ownership&#8221;, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee recommended that Ministers looked at two areas, the second of which was</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/6">&#8220;measures that increase the opportunity for supporters trusts to achieve a share in their clubs, whether on a minority or majority basis.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/7">In response, the Government said, in paragraph 40, that they urge</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/8">&#8220;the football authorities to consider ways to actively encourage and incentivise methods of including supporter representatives on the Boards of clubs.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/9">Under paragraph 67, they said:</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/10">&#8220;The Government is fully committed to ensuring that the changes put forward by the football authorities make a lasting and substantive difference. If that does not happen the Government will introduce a legal requirement on the Football Association to implement the appropriate governance clauses by the swiftest possible means. To do that the Government will seek to secure, using all available channels, appropriate legislation as soon as Parliamentary time allows. There is a strong case for such legislative proposals to be formally considered in pre-legislative scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/11">On the issue of fan ownership, in the same response to the Select Committee, the Government said:</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/12">&#8220;The Government will consider bringing together an informal expert group to report on the degree to which there are other issues that create genuine barriers and to provide recommendations for practical action.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/13">That was in October 2011 and it was not until October 2014, six months before the general election, that the Government set up the expert working group. I am certain that the Government will say in response to my Bill that we should wait for the working group&#8217;s recommendations, but it took three years for the Government to set up the group and they did so knowing that there was no chance that they would have to respond to its conclusions before the general election. Until I am convinced that the Government intend to act, I shall proceed with my Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/14">The Bill seeks to do three things. The first is to give fans the power to buy up to 10% of shares that are offered for sale when there is a change of ownership, which is recognised as being when 30% of the shares are up for sale. The fans&#8217; right to buy will not stop any transaction being completed and anyone purchasing shares will know that fans have the right to buy up to 10% of the shares purchased for up to 240 days after the transaction is completed. These will be bought at the average price paid by the buyer for the relevant securities in the year preceding the change of control. This automatic option will be capped once the fans have acquired 10% of club shares, but that would not prevent fans from buying more shares if they wanted.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/15">In addition, fans will be given the right to elect and remove two representatives on the boards of clubs or 25% of the board membership, whichever is the greater number. Fan reps will have to undergo training to understand the sensitivities of their role as board members.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/16">Finally, in order to take up these powers, a club&#8217;s fans must organise themselves into a single representative body. I would suggest the model of an industrial and provident society, but I appreciate that fans will want to be consulted on the best way forward. I will undertake to do that. There is no escaping the fact that there will be a requirement on fans to act collectively to set up a single democratic and accountable body for the election and scrutiny of board representatives and the management of shares. The Bill will set out what constitutes a viable fan body for this purpose.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/17">We have talked around this issue for too long. Some have said that the people in the fan groups are not</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/18">representative of ordinary fans, but they are the ones who helped me to consult the members of the fan trusts and fan clubs. They are the ones represented on the Government&#8217;s expert working group, whom the FA consult and who step in when an irresponsible owner has destroyed their club. We need only to think of Hereford, which has been resurrected by fans, of Portsmouth and Swansea, and the remarkable story of AFC Wimbledon. They all have one thing in common: football fans have had to step in and save their local club when the owners have destroyed it. As football fans, our passion for our clubs is lifelong. We do not change our clubs like we change the supermarket in which we shop.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/19">We have seen how the game has become increasingly remote from the people who make it what it is today. Football fans create the atmosphere in the grounds and make our leagues so exciting to watch, which in turn makes money from the sale of the TV rights, yet on issues such as ticket prices, club names, sponsorship deals, stadium naming rights, club colours and moving clubs, they are too often an afterthought.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/20">Our football clubs are not simply businesses. They exist because generation after generation of people from the communities in which they are situated have sustained their clubs through thick and thin. I do not present the Bill as a solution to all the problems, but giving fans a voice is a stepping stone to more accountability in the game. Fans are not the solution to every problem, but they can and will be the eyes and ears of an early warning system for emerging problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.182.2/21">Today we take a step towards putting fans on club boards, but in time it will be the FA board and the boards of UEFA and FIFA. It is time to trust the people who make the game special&#8212;the fans, who will be there long after the owners have moved on.</p>

It is a matter that is genuinely urgent, given the time scale that has been presented to the House by the Government, although it need not necessarily have been so. The urgency is of the Government&#8217;s own making. The matter had been under consideration already and would benefit from further mature consideration.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.4/1">I am not entirely sure whether the hon.

It will be interesting to see what influence the Government business managers bring to bear on that in the fullness of time.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.6/1">Rather than saying that that should be part of the discussion, I think it comes to the very heart of the discussion. I fully accept that the devolution process that was started in 1999 has created within the United Kingdom a number of anomalies. I entirely understand the concerns felt by right hon. and hon. Members representing constituencies in England, in particular. In order to address these anomalies, we need mature considered measures, instead of replacing the existing anomalies with further anomalies, as I very much fear the Government are about to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.185.7/1">Surely it is true to say that discussions about future devolutionary change can go on. What is proposed is a change in the</p>
	<p pid="b.185.7/2">Standing Orders simply to give a veto to the representatives of the people affected. That does not lead to an English Parliament or to English initiative; it finally brings a little justice into the system. It is based on what we had in our manifesto, and it should be proceeded with quickly.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. Indeed, I suspect that I am more grateful than his colleagues on the Treasury Bench are, because he has nailed one point very early on: this does constitute a veto. As a federalist, I have no problem with vetoes, but if they are to be part of our parliamentary procedure we have to be prepared to have them going in different directions. The veto now being anticipated for English Members of Parliament would not be available to Scottish Members of Parliament, because they are governed by the Sewell convention and legislative consent measures. That is only the subject of a convention; it is not a veto. That is what I mean when I say that the Government, by bringing their proposal forward in this manner, risk creating further anomalies. The anomaly is one not of detail, but of fundamental constitutional principle. Were the House to bring together its collective mind, I do not doubt that we could eventually find a solution. Perhaps we would reach a compromise that was a little messy, but it is something we could reach. However, we are not going to reach that in the one day that will be offered to us to debate the changes to the Standing Orders.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.1/1">Is the right hon. Gentleman not ignoring history? Scotland has had special arrangements in this House since the Victorian period. From 1948 Bills could be dealt with by the Scottish Grand Committee, and that was expanded in the 1990s, as he knows very well, and eventually Scotland ended up with its own Parliament. He cannot stop some change on the basis that it is not the final change.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.2/1">I am by no means resistant to some change, and I will return to that point shortly. The hon. and learned Gentleman will be aware that the Scottish Grand Committee could debate Bills, but it could not vote on or amend them. That is how Grand Committees work. They are a perfectly sensible mechanism by which debate can be conducted by those who have the most direct interest, although they are perhaps a little redundant in this age of devolution, but they are by no means an attack on the fundamental principle that once we leave the Committee Rooms and enter this Chamber we are all equal and have the same right to participate in votes.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.3/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman not accept that the biggest danger facing the Union is not Scottish nationalism, but English nationalism? If we fail to deal with English votes on English laws in a timely manner, as set out in our manifesto, which the people voted for, English nationalism will see off our Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.186.4/1">I absolutely agree 100% with the hon. Gentleman. The threat comes from English nationalism. However&#8212;it pains me to say this&#8212;that English nationalism is to be found on the Treasury Bench. The Leader of the House, when he came to the</p>
	<p pid="b.186.4/2">Dispatch Box last week, took great pains to say that he was speaking as a Conservative and Unionist. I hate to say it, but he has brought forward something that no Unionist should. It is perfectly understandable for people in England to identify a national interest in response to a mood of Scottish nationalism forming north of the border, but the answer is not to meet it with more nationalism. The answer, I suggest, is a proper federal structure across the whole United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.1/1">This is where I will try to make some progress. I have been generous in taking interventions so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.1/2">As I said yesterday, I want today&#8217;s debate to focus on the means by which the Government are seeking to achieve English votes for English laws, rather than the principle of English votes for English laws itself. As I have said, I am not without sympathy for the principle. I think that ultimately the solution will be for the people of England to decide what they want their constitutional future to be. Are they to have an English Parliament? If so, they should have an English Parliament, and this is the United Kingdom Parliament. Are they to have a network of regional Assemblies or something of that sort? That is a decision for the people of England, not something that we should seek to shoehorn into our Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.1/3">My concern about what is proposed is that it is the most modest of proposals. It does not deal with the over-centralisation of power in Whitehall that blights people in England. It does not deal with the lack of proportionality. It does not deal with the fact that there is only one UK Independence party MP for 4 million votes. Those issues are also a democratic affront that require urgent consideration by those on the Treasury Bench, yet they do not seem to be attended to by the determination to introduce changes to the Standing Orders before the House rises for the summer recess.</p>

They are helpful, in as much as they give some detail on the proposals, but they give no indication of what they are seeking to achieve and where this will ultimately take us. The question of the double majority was raised earlier by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon.

Once we have crossed that threshold&#8212;crossed the constitutional Rubicon&#8212;we have to wonder where it will ultimately take us.</p>

	<p pid="b.188.7/3">the fullest consideration because it is understood that they become exposed only with proper debate and scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.7/4">One of the novel aspects of the proposal that the Leader of the House laid before the House last week is the extension of these matters to Finance Bills. That opens up a whole range of questions that were not answered by him at the Dispatch Box or by the papers that he placed in the Vote Office. Finance Bills are, and have been for a long time, treated differently by this House. The fact that they are considered only by this House and not by the other place is the obvious difference, but there are also differences in the way in which they are introduced and considered in a mix of time spent here on the Floor of the House and in the Committee Room upstairs.</p>

	<p pid="b.189.8/3">areas. Will the Leader of the House explain how his proposed new system is going to work for the consideration of estimates? For example, will estimates debates continue to be a vehicle for Select Committees, and how will that work when Select Committees draw their members from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which will be the case in this Parliament, as we can see from the Order Papers for today and and tomorrow?</p>
	<p pid="b.189.8/4">This goes to the point that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10753" name="Kevin Brennan">the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> made about serving on Committees. I do not doubt that the Committee concerned, with good will, and perhaps even a measure of discussion among the usual channels, could deal with this, but the anomaly has been created and as yet the Government have no answer to it. Where is this going to take us in future? How are Members of Parliament from areas of the country that exercise devolved powers going to interact with Select Committees? If the principle of veto is to be accepted, and if members of the Health Committee or the Education Committee, for example, are to be drawn only from England and Wales, then I very much look forward to seeing how the Government are going to set up the Scottish Affairs and Northern Ireland Affairs Committees&#8212;good luck to them on that one.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.8/5">If the principle of the veto is to work, it has to work both ways. For the Scottish Parliament, that means the end of the Sewel convention and the end of the conventional sense&#8212;the classic sense&#8212;of parliamentary sovereignty as it has been understood in this Chamber in the past, because if we give a veto to the Scottish Parliament on legislative consent motions, then that is the end of Dicey&#8217;s classic definition of sovereignty. I am not too unhappy about that&#8212;I am quite relaxed about it&#8212;but if the House is to undertake something of this sort, then surely it requires more than the debate that we are being offered.</p>

	<p pid="b.191.3/1">The two propositions are not mutually exclusive. There are elements that could be capable of remedy through Standing Orders if we were to have a proper debate. The Government&#8217;s proposal goes too far, too fast. In principle, other changes may be possible, as we discussed in government before the general election. I do not completely exclude the possibility of proceeding in that way, but going as far as the Government want to us to go, and within their timescale, brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.3/2">The last Government discussed whether the proposal could be addressed in a single Bill. If there is a will in the House to consider how it could be done, that would be a much more sensible way of doing it. The Government are saying that we should do it for a year and that it should then be reviewed by the Procedure Committee. I hold that Committee in very high esteem, but the only thing that would happen under that process is an examination of how the system had worked. It would not put a dangerous genie back in the bottle after it had been let out. I think we all know that that is the political reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.191.3/3">Personally, I am quite relaxed about the use of primary legislation and the justiciability of decisions then made by Mr Speaker. I do not think that anybody in this House should be making any decision that would not stand up to judicial scrutiny. However, if that is to be the block, let us have a proper debate, because it must be possible to use primary legislation to deal with that very point. Surely it is necessary to have a proper description of the boundaries of judicial review and any proscriptions. Frankly, this House has never undertaken such an exercise. Judicial review as a body of law has been allowed to grow like Topsy, led by the judiciary itself.</p>

Fairness requires that further devolution of powers to Scotland and Wales be accompanied by a louder voice for England at Westminster on English matters. If we are devolving tax rates to other countries of the United Kingdom&#8212;the House is currently legislating to do so&#8212;it is only fair that Members of Parliament in those constituencies affected by that change have the decisive say over any tax rates that apply in their constituencies.

At the time, I was lobbied by the then Conservative Opposition and by Labour rebels, who told me that the Scottish National party should vote against that proposal on the basis that top-up fees for English students would have a knock-on effect on Scotland through the Barnett formula. Why has the Conservative</p>
	<p pid="b.192.5/2">party changed its mind? If these proposals go through, would I be in a position to exercise a vote on such a measure in the future?</p>

Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase> about estimates. It is not our intention that estimates be voted on by individual groups of Members. They are, and will continue to be, a matter for the United Kingdom Parliament. On the question of tuition fees, what <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond)</phrase> must understand is that one of the things that was not understood by those in England who were affected by that change&#8212;which, if I recall correctly, was carried by a majority of five&#8212;is that, although English MPs voted against it, it was only as a result of the votes of Scottish MPs that it was carried, but it did not apply to students in Scotland. That is a very simple example. If a measure is to be applied to a group of people in England and not in Scotland, is it really unreasonable to suggest that English Members of Parliament should have the decisive say over that change?</p>

All Members of Parliament are equal, and all of them will be able to continue to debate and vote on every piece of legislation passing through the House of Commons. It is simply incorrect to say that any Member of this House will be excluded from voting on or debating any piece of legislation.

Given that there are 22 pages of Standing Orders introducing a range of very complex things, will the Leader of the House use this opportunity to confirm that he will table a motion for next week&#8217;s debate that will allow the draft Standing Orders to be amended appropriately, rather than to allow them to be amended just once at the moment of interruption, which would be a farce?</p>

The boundaries between the courts and Parliament are long established and well respected. There is a principle of mutual respect, which means that the courts will not generally challenge the means by which legislation is passed or decisions taken in Parliament. There is a strong feeling in the House that using legislation to govern our legislative process would risk opening it up to legal challenge and that ultimate authority may pass from you, Mr Speaker, to the courts. We therefore have to be immensely careful.</p>
	<p pid="b.197.3/3">Parts of the processes of the House have been legislated on, but I think that it would be better to consider the issue of legislation in 12 months&#8217; time as part of the review, when we have seen the detail of how this works and invited the Procedure Committee to look in detail at how to make it work as effectively as possible. It is important that we are careful.</p>

	<p pid="b.200.5/3">To avoid any scintilla of doubt, the official Opposition accept that with the prospect of greater devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the voice of English MPs must be heard on matters that relate purely to England. That could be achieved in any number of ways, but we believe strongly that such changes would best be achieved by the widest consideration and proper consultation with all political parties and wider civil society. Cross-party support would also be desirable, and it is regrettable in the extreme that the Government have made no meaningful efforts to facilitate that.

	<p pid="b.205.0/1">On that aspect, the hon. Lady is missing the point. If there were a majority in both Houses for a specific piece of legislation, there would be a majority in the House to suspend Standing Orders.

	<p pid="b.205.1/1">The proposals for a double majority, as far as I understand them, are extremely worrying.

	<p pid="b.205.2/1">The issue of Standing Orders is absolutely at the heart of the matter. The proposals make no suggestion of entrenchment of Standing Orders and no requirement of a special majority to suspend them. The House regularly suspends Standing Orders in particular circumstances&#8212;to speed up the passing of a Bill, to change the sitting hours or whatever it may be. The flexibility of Standing Orders ought to be a reassurance to the Labour party. If a future Labour Government are dependent on Scottish votes, they will be able to get their business through the House because they can suspend Standing Orders.</p>

	<p pid="b.205.3/1">It is terribly kind of the hon. Gentleman to give us that assurance, but we need to base changes to our constitution on more than that.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.3/2">The process the Government have chosen to use to create EVEL goes against every precedent. Substantial constitutional changes should be implemented by Acts of Parliament and examined in both Houses. They should not be rushed through in changes to Standing Orders. Changes to Commons Standing Orders cannot be challenged in the courts because of article 9 of the Bill of Rights, nor can they be subject to proper, open scrutiny in both Houses of Parliament. They are clearly not suitable for introducing a de facto English Parliament within the existing Union Parliament, as the Government have proposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.205.3/3">All major constitutional changes, from the supremacy of the Commons in the Parliament Acts through to our membership of the European Union and the devolution</p>
	<p pid="b.205.3/4">process, have been introduced by Acts of Parliament&#8212;the Parliament Act 1911, the Parliament Act 1949, the European Communities Act 1972, the Human Rights Act 1998, the Government of Wales Act 1998, the Scotland Act 1998 and the Greater London Authority Act 1999. Each of those Acts was properly scrutinised over a period of time, with days of debates in both Houses and the proper consideration of amendments. Many were preceded by Green Papers, White Papers and a thorough debate in the country. Some could only be commenced after a referendum had been won. All those measures are subject to interpretation in the courts. Under the Government&#8217;s proposals, the introduction of English votes for English laws would not be.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.0/1">The hon. Lady is of course right in reading that list, but I say to her gently that the point we are at today is the logical consequence of the way in which devolution was carried out. The logical consequence at its end is that, if we wish to reform the structures of this House in the way she wants, we need a written constitution and a completely different basis on which we are to operate. That was one of the things that those on the Labour Front Bench at the time said persistently they did not wish to see happen. Bringing forward measures to change these matters by Standing Orders is the only way to honour the commitment made by those on the Labour Treasury Bench at the time.</p>

	<p pid="b.206.3/1">I have already given way to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I want to get on, because many people wish to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.3/2">Previous changes to Standing Orders, which were nowhere near as radical as these, were introduced initially on a temporary basis, often at the suggestion of the Procedure Committee, and tested out before either being abandoned or made permanent. Many innovative changes to Standing Orders have been introduced on a temporary basis initially. For example, the changes introduced by the previous Labour Government allowing for debates in Westminster Hall were temporary and subject to renewal. So too were the changes introducing the programming of legislation and deferred Divisions. Yet the Government have not even asked the Procedure Committee to report on the changes it has sprung on the House. They have merely suggested that it should have a review into the new arrangements, but only after they have already been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.206.3/3">It is usual for changes to procedures of the House to be approved by free votes, as they are House business not Government business. This was the case with House of Lords Reform; changes to the legislative process,</p>
	<p pid="b.206.3/4">including the introduction of public evidence for Committees; the programming of Bills; and the election of the Speaker. The EVEL proposals, however, are Government business and they are especially partisan because of their explicit inclusion in the Conservative manifesto.</p>

	<p pid="b.207.1/1">I am arguing that this is the wrong way to do this kind of change. The procedures and Standing Orders of the House should be House business. They should not be infected by Conservative or Labour Whips. It is the Government who have chosen to make these changes in this way. The right hon. Gentleman should be ashamed of himself.</p>
	<p pid="b.207.1/2">We are now to believe that the Government should mandate changes to the Standing Orders of the Commons as set out in their manifesto and force them through using a whipped vote. This is a very, very sad day. The Government&#8217;s changes will turn their slim majority of 12 into over three figures if both Scottish and Welsh MPs are to be prevented from voting. I believe this is the real driver behind the changes, and it makes the outrageous procedural fix, of using Standing Orders rather than legislation to produce the change, even more unacceptable. I hope that even at this late hour the Government will think again. The unintended consequences of what they are doing could be very large indeed and the precedents they are setting are dire.</p>

	<p pid="b.207.2/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. We all heard the Leader of the House indicate that tuition fees in England might be a measure subject to the procedure that he is outlining, anticipating not just the changes to Standing Orders but your certification if the change to Standing Orders take place. I know the Leader of the House does not understand the Barnett formula, but I know you do, Sir. Would that not therefore put you in a position of having to certify and disallow the votes of Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Members of Parliament despite the clear direct and indirect effects that that would have on their rights to vote and on their constituents? Would that not be not just an invidious position, but greater than the shoulders any one man could bear&#8212;if I remember the quote correctly, when just such a measure was rejected in the 19th century?</p>

	<p pid="b.207.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman has demonstrated very clearly that he knows his Gladstone and we are grateful to him for that. The short answer to him is that if these measures take effect, the responsibility of the Chair will be to fulfil his duties in accordance with the Standing Orders. That is the factual position. How people interpret that, what gloss&#8212;I use that term non-pejoratively&#8212;people put on it, is a matter for them. The Chair will do the duty of the Chair.

I say she is ahead of herself with no spirit of surprise at all, but there are no such Standing Orders yet. My counsel to the hon. Lady is to wait and see, or, in the words not of Gladstone but of the late Lord Whitelaw, it is probably best to cross bridges only when you come to them. Perhaps we can leave it there for today.

	<p pid="b.208.1/2">First, may I say that the Leader of the House has met me on a number of occasions in the past six weeks to keep me informed of the Government&#8217;s proposals? The problem we have, which afflicts the whole House, is that at this moment we have no Select Committees. Not a single Select Committee is meeting yet, because the relevant orders have not been laid.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.1/3">The politics of what we are debating today and what we will debate next week are for the Government and this House to decide. I very much want to focus on a few areas that the Procedure Committee will want to cover later in this Parliament. As I said, the Committee is yet to meet. I hope we will meet before we rise for the summer recess, but that is not guaranteed. I will be sending a letter, as the elected Chairman of the Procedure Committee, to the Leader of the House later this week.</p>

	<p pid="b.208.2/1">Is it therefore not distinctly odd that the Leader of the House wishes to take great pride in sticking to his manifesto commitment, when that commitment said he would consult the Procedure Committee before he brought the proposals to the House?

	<p pid="b.208.3/1">The pursuit of perfection is always to be desired, but it is not often achieved. That is the best answer I can give to the hon. Lady.</p>
	<p pid="b.208.3/2">If the House votes for these changes next Wednesday, the Committee will want to consider how future Bills are drafted and whether their scope might be narrowed to enhance their Englishness. Will there be a temptation to narrow a Bill so that England comes to the fore and other parts of the Union are excluded? In due course, we will want to take evidence from Clerks and parliamentary counsel. In the last Parliament, there were some hard-won successes to make Report and programming more effective.</p>

It is important that the Leader of the House identifies in the near future where this time will come from. We cannot have the Report stage being pared back.

The Government will need to be careful in the language they use when introducing a Bill. It is right that an explanatory memorandum asserts the Government&#8217;s view about the scope of the Bill, but that assertion should not be made overtly or aggressively. We do not want a Bill introduced with the Government saying, &#8220;This is absolutely unquestionably relating to England only, and anyone who disagrees is a total and utter idiot&#8221;&#8212;that would be the subtext. They need to be careful in their language so as not to be seen to be putting undue pressure on the Chair&#8212;I dare suggest&#8212;to come up with a certification one way or another.</p>

	<p pid="b.210.5/1">On the question of whether a Bill should apply to England only or some other combination, all Bills currently contain a territorial extent clause. Does that not give a very good indication of whether a Bill applies solely to one part of the kingdom or another?</p>

	<p pid="b.211.9/3">The guidance attached to the proposed <phrase class="standing-order" code="83(j)">Standing Order No. 83(j)</phrase> says that the judgment of what is &#8220;minor or consequential&#8221; is for the Speaker. I think the Government should provide some examples of what they feel count as &#8220;minor or consequential&#8221;. We also need greater clarification of what the &#8220;or&#8221; means. As <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond)</phrase> knows, <phrase class="standing-order" code="97(1)(a)">Standing Order No. 97(1)(a)</phrase> relates to the Scottish Grand Committee, and the term used there is &#8220;minor consequential amendments&#8221;&#8212;there is no &#8220;or&#8221;.

As already mentioned, it is very rare that we have the opportunity to debate an important issue under <phrase class="standing-order" code="24">Standing Order No. 24</phrase>. That suggests once again just how important this matter is and why we need to turn our attention to the many issues already identified in some of the fine contributions of right hon. and hon.

	<p pid="b.212.0/2">What we are doing is quite extraordinary. We have not done anything like this for centuries. It is of historical significance because it is of such constitutional importance. Nothing has been done like this since the days of Gladstone. I look nervously at <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24926" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon.

	<p pid="b.212.2/1">The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to know that I would not have defined it as a &#8220;crisis&#8221;, but as constitutional progress, but he is right in one respect&#8212;if this is an attempt to try to save the Union, God help them! It seems as though the Government are absolutely determined to push us out. They are introducing English votes for English laws in the same week as we have been debating amendments to the Scotland Bill, and 58 out of 59 Scottish Members of Parliament supported measures that were agreed in the</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/2">Scottish Parliament by every single party in it. To be voted down by English Members of Parliament shows that this is not just English votes for English laws; it is English votes for Scottish laws. It is totally and utterly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/3">We are hearing about vetoes. Yes, that is a major characteristic of what the Government intend to do&#8212;to have a veto on issues that will be for England only. How are they are going to achieve that? They are going to give Members of Parliament iPads in the Lobbies. It is not only English votes for English laws; it is English iPads for English laws. Why do they not just tattoo our foreheads as &#8220;Scottish&#8221;&#8212;then they would not have to vote on the iPads and they would be able to identify us. Apparently, though, that was turned down for this more high-tech solution. It is utterly and absolutely bizarre.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/4">One would think that, with something as constitutionally important and of such historical significance as this, we would have the fullest possible debate and full scrutiny. To create something as important as this, one would expect debate not just in this House, but in every single constituency and community across the United Kingdom. We would have thought there would be a Bill and an opportunity for it to be properly debated, and that the Bill would have different stages, at which hon. Members would be able to table amendments to be discussed, debated and decided on.</p>
	<p pid="b.212.2/5">What do we have, however? We have two weeks in which to consider this issue. It was introduced by the Leader of the House last Thursday. This House has been invited to make up its mind a week on Wednesday. The Leader of the House would not even answer any parliamentary questions about English votes for English laws, but we got one yesterday, did we not, and by Jove, was it a cracker.</p>

	<p pid="b.213.1/1">May I say to the Leader of the House&#8212;this is an important point&#8212;that we have been discussing, debating and looking at these issues for a long time in the House. We hear again and again about the West Lothian question and how it has to be addressed. I have a great deal of sympathy with English Members when it comes to this. I think there is a point to be addressed and that something needs to be done. However, to do it on the basis of the mad proposals of the Leader of the House is almost an insult to the House. To present his paper last Thursday and then to ask every Member to reach some sort of conclusion about what we should do is just about the worst possible disrespect to this House. The Leader of the House has to reconsider the amount of time he is going to give us to discuss the matter because this is huge. It is massive. It has never been done before.</p>

Gentleman seems to me to be arguing that we should not be taking the current Scottish legislation through Parliament at all, and that we should be having a national constitutional convention. We are responding to the vow, which he said was absolute, but I must gently point out that there was also a vow to the electorate in England and Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom that we would legislate to change the Standing Orders of the House. That, surely, encapsulates part of the problem. It is a bit difficult for the hon. Gentleman to come and argue against it when he asks for exactly the same position for the purpose of his own agenda.</p>

We agreed to&#8212;we voted for&#8212;a particular dynamic or trajectory of Scottish politics. We wanted to see further powers for our Parliament. That has been turned down by English Members, so we are unhappy. I sense that my Welsh colleagues are unhappy as well. In a debate last week, I heard them raise some of the cross-border aspects of what is being suggested. I know, because we are hearing it non-stop, that English Members are unhappy, and they are probably right to be unhappy. I know that they are furious about Scottish Members. How dare we come down and vote on their precious public services? However, there is a solution: it is called federalism, and it is what we thought we were voting for last year. What we were promised was as close as possible to federalism, or to home rule.</p>

	<p pid="b.216.4/1">That is exactly the point that I was coming to. There are ways of dealing with it. I suggested a solution in the form of federalism, but I did not sense any warmth towards that proposal from the Government Benches, so let us try another way. The right hon. Gentleman is right: we do not vote on English-only legislation. What we do is this. Every time a Bill is introduced, we scour it for the Scottish interest. We look for the Barnett consequential issues, and we establish whether it will have an impact on Scotland. If it will not have that impact, we leave it alone. We stay well away: of course we do. With all due respect to my English friends, I have better things to do than scour legislation about policing arrangements in Plymouth when I am looking after the people of Perth and North Perthshire.</p>

As currently drafted the Standing Orders are worded in terms of the Speaker being told or instructed; it is stated that the Speaker &#8220;shall&#8221; treat minor or consequential effects and disregard them.

I do not want just an extra day; I want the process that involves this House looking properly at all this.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.0/2">This is an absolute and utter shambles and it is falling apart in front of the Government as we speak. The Leader of the House has divided the whole House on these issues, with Labour, the SNP, the Liberals and everybody else against the Conservatives. I suggest that the Leader of the House takes these plans away, looks at them properly, and brings them back when we have an opportunity to debate them properly and scrutinise them effectively, and this House gets its say on these issues. As things currently stand, you, Mr Speaker, are placed in a dreadful situation and this provision does not command anything like a spirit of partnership or a consensus across this House. Take them away, bring them back, do something better, and do not treat us as second-class citizens in the unitary United Kingdom Parliament of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That is unacceptable to us.</p>

	<p pid="b.219.1/1">I have received your message that you wish me to be relatively brief, Mr Speaker, and I shall do my best to abide by that and not model myself on Gladstone, whom we have had earlier reference to, and who Disraeli said was a</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/2">&#8220;sophistical rhetorician, inebriated by the exuberance of his own verbosity.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/3">I shall try to avoid verbosity and inebriation at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/4">It has been said in this debate that this process has been rushed. That things have been rushed is the classic objection to almost any constitutional change, and it is one I am fond of using personally, but on this occasion it would only be rushed for a member of the Roman Curia or perhaps part of the mandarin class of imperial China. The issue we are considering has been debated since the 1880s. I do not think a period of 130 years is unduly rushed. The West Lothian question itself was raised by the hon. baronet the former Member for West Lothian, Tam Dalyell, in the 1970s, but we have had plenty of time to consider and deliberate on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/5">The second major objection is that two classes of Members are being created. If I believed that to be true, I would oppose this proposal because I think there is a unity within this House that is of fundamental constitutional importance, and, looking at the SNP Benches opposite and considering the contribution its Members have already made since their election in May, it is striking how important that point is: every Member needs to be free to participate in the debates on the laws that we make. That is a reasonable and fair principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/6">In a characteristically forthright speech from <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11333" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, we have heard that the Scotland Bill does not give Scottish MPs the same type of veto as English MPs, but I think that is wrong. It is a misunderstanding of what the Scotland Bill is doing, because if this Standing Order were already in place, the Scotland Bill would be</p>
	<p pid="b.219.1/7">devolving the issues to Scotland and to English MPs in this House at the same point. Yesterday we debated the Crown estates and how they would be a devolved matter to the Scottish Parliament. If that goes through the House of Lords, it will be a matter that in England will only be voted on by English MPs, or at least they will have a veto on it. What is devolved to Scotland is equally and simultaneously devolved to England. That seems perfectly reasonable.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.1/1">The double voting does not only apply to Members from England; it applies to Members from England, Wales and potentially Northern Ireland, if the issue is devolved to one Assembly but not the others. If there is a matter that is not devolved to Wales, Welsh MPs would be involved in that second lock on legislation. That is right and fair, because it ensures that those who represent the relevant constituencies have a say on how the law is made and a block on it, but, crucially, they cannot make the law unless all UK MPs support it in a majority.</p>

	<p pid="b.220.2/1">What would happen in the case of a welfare reform Bill, which we would be told applied to England and Wales because, on paper, Northern Ireland would have welfare reform devolved? As we see from the Treasury, this is entirely karaoke legislation and the money will not flow unless the Assembly passes the legislation that has already been passed here. Would Northern Ireland Members be told that they did not count in the double majority for welfare legislation?</p>

	<p pid="b.220.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very interesting point. I think this is covered in the Standing Order, but it may need further revision. The Standing Order makes provision for the Speaker to certify that where a matter is about to be devolved, it has already been devolved and therefore in the legislation should require an English vote. It therefore follows logically that if a matter is about to be undevolved, because the relevant devolved Assembly cannot come to a decision, the Speaker ought to certify differently. It may be that the Standing Order needs an amendment to clarify that, but it is certainly within the spirit of the Standing Order as currently written. It is ensuring an equality of all Members of Parliament because no legislation can pass without a majority in this House.</p>

Or are we creating a situation in which Scottish MPs who successfully retain the trust of their constituents and get re-elected to this place become disqualified from legislating, whereas former Scottish MPs who get kicked out of here but then get appointed to another place are rewarded for their failure by being allowed to legislate on matters from which the democratically elected MPs are excluded?</p>

	<p pid="b.221.1/1">That is of the greatest importance. The English must recognise that if we want the Union to maintain, we must not require exact parity. The United Kingdom is 85% English, and the English demanding exact parity is the way to destroy the Union. The English, in this context, have to be generous. It is important that we remember that; otherwise we destroy the Union that we are seeking to protect. That is why Standing Orders are important&#8212;they can be reversed.

	<p pid="b.221.4/1">It is a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24926" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg)</phrase>, a constitutional scholar who spoke with great authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/2">There is no doubt in my mind that the Conservative party has a right to take action on this issue. It won a majority at the general election. It has a right to take action and it has the power to do so because it has a majority in this House. The question for Conservative Members is: what is the right way of doing this? That is what I want to talk about.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/3">Government Members are in the Conservative and Unionist party. I suggest that the way the Leader of the House is going about this is true neither to the Conservative</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/4">tradition nor the Unionist tradition. No good will come of the way he is going about his proposals, and I want to explain why. This goes to the point that the shadow Leader of the House made about how this is done: whether it is rushed through next week, through Standing Orders, or done in a considered way. I wish to focus on the issue of English-only Bills. This is not just about English-only Bills, because English-only clauses are mentioned in the Leader of the House&#8217;s proposals. You, Mr Speaker, will have to certify not only whether a Bill is England only, but whether a clause is England only. That will be an unenviable task.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/5">The hon. Member for North East Somerset said that this issue has been around for 130 years. He is absolutely right about that, but why has it been around for that long? This is what Gladstone said in 1893 when he abandoned his second home rule Bill:</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/6">&#8220;it passed the wit of man to frame any distinct, thorough-going, universal severance between the one class of subject and the other&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/7">In other words, this is what is now the English-only question. In his time, it was a distinction between the Irish legislation and so-called &#8220;imperial legislation&#8221; .</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/8">Let us fast-forward to 1965, when Harold Wilson was the Prime Minister. He was furious because his Bill to nationalise the steel industry was defeated by the votes of MPs from Northern Ireland, so he told one of his Cabinet, &#8220;We&#8217;ve really got to do something about this.&#8221; The person in question said, &#8220;I think that is not very wise, Prime Minister, because it is really hard to make the distinction. Gladstone tried it.&#8221; Wilson therefore set up a royal commission, which reported in 1974, concluding that we could not distinguish between the so-called &#8220;ins&#8221; and the &#8220;outs&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/9">The reason I made the intervention I did on the Leader of the House is that this is at the heart of why this problem&#8212;it is a problem and an anomaly&#8212;has not been solved in 130 years. With all due respect, he proposes to do it on the back of a fag packet next week. I therefore intervened on him, following the intervention by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond)</phrase>, to ask how you, Mr Speaker, were supposed to decide on what was an England-only Bill. The Leader of the House said it is simple&#8212;it is a devolved matter. But then we have to deal with the issue of tuition fees, as clearly a rise in tuition fees has Barnett consequentials. So goodness knows.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/10">This is where I come to the real thing, and why I appeal to Conservative Members to think how they are going to vote next week. The question before us is: does this strengthen or weaken the United Kingdom? There is clearly an English question to address, as the general election illustrated to me very clearly, but the issue is how we address it sensibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/11">Let us just fast-forward to this Session of Parliament once this proposal goes through, if it does. It is not as though the problem is going to be solved&#8212;the problem just begins, because the arguments made by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase> and the right hon. Member for Gordon will be played out not just in this House but throughout the United Kingdom. People will be saying, &#8220;That is an outrage. The Speaker has ruled that is an England-only Bill but it affects us.&#8221; Other people will be saying, &#8220;That is an outrage. He said it is not an England-only Bill.&#8221; That takes me to the simple point: we are talking about something of such</p>
	<p pid="b.221.4/12">huge constitutional significance. I say to Conservative Members: you have the power, of course you do, but do not use it next week because it is not true to your traditions. Your traditions are to be the Conservative and Unionist party, but this is neither for Conservatism nor Unionism.</p>

	<p pid="b.223.1/1">Because a few months before the election the Conservative party thought it was a useful weapon at the general election&#8212;it turned out that it was, but let us leave that to one side.

There&#8217;s something up here.&#8221; What is up here is how we make this change happen. I ask this question again: is this true to the traditions of Conservatism? No, it is not, because the last thing the Conservatives should do is rip up hundreds of years of constitutional practice in a Standing Order vote just before the House goes into recess.

	<p pid="b.223.5/1">Thanks very much. We won the referendum. My party was in alliance with the Conservative Party, as the Scottish National party has pointed out, but the cause of Unionism has not been well served since then. I will not start laying blame; people will know what I think about this. The question for the Conservative party, which has a majority, is how does it properly serve the cause of Unionism? Following this procedure in the way that has been proposed is frankly an act of constitutional vandalism. It is not true to the great traditions of the Conservative and Unionist party, which is why I urge Government Members to vote against this measure next week.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.1/1">It is a great honour to follow the former Leader of the Opposition, who spoke with great passion. I wish to share and agree with some of the points that he made. The Conservative party is not an ideological party; it is not a party of narrow party interest. The Conservative party is a party of the nation. It is a party not just of England, but of the United Kingdom. Our aim, our will and everything that we should strive for in this Parliament is to maintain the United Kingdom, because the United Kingdom hangs by a thread. We should not give any succour to those who wish to break up the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/2">This debate is about not just the principles of these issues, but the time, and that is what I wish to speak on. We must have adequate time. We must assure everyone in the country as a whole that we have not just debated this matter in an afternoon, constrained by statements or urgent questions, with no real time to debate the 22 amendments to Standing Orders. Next week, we will debate this on Wednesday, but we have an Adjournment debate on Thursday. How often do the Whips run around, trying to fill up this Chamber, with no one taking any interest? Here we have a major constitutional issue with only a part of a day in which to discuss it. In all sincerity, I say to the Leader of the House that he should use his power to allow another day&#8212;a full day&#8212;for amendments, as this is a matter of vital concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.1/3">I hope that I am not giving away any confidences here, but when we were having these discussions in the 1922 Committee before the general election, I constantly warned about the threat to the United Kingdom. I was assured by my colleagues, &#8220;No, we must have a full exclusion of all Scottish Members, as that is what the English want. They will be the Parnellites, and they will misuse this Parliament to filibuster and delay matters. We should exclude them entirely.&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, don&#8217;t exclude them, because that will be a lever to break open the United Kingdom.&#8221; I was then told by my colleagues that the Scots do not care. &#8220;The Scots don&#8217;t want to take part in English business,&#8221; they said. The trouble is that the SNP will make them care. We have already heard <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11333" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> making that point again and again. This will become a real issue, because the SNP will say, as it is perfectly entitled to do, that this is not only English business, as it has consequences for Scotland because of the Barnett formula.</p>

	<p pid="b.224.5/1">Of course the SNP wants independence, but why are we making it easier for it? What we are discussing today&#8212;what we will achieve in Standing Orders&#8212;will not change the result of a single</p>
	<p pid="b.224.5/2">vote in this Parliament, because the Conservative party has an overall majority. If we lose the next general election, the Labour party, or whatever is in power, will simply reverse it, so why are we giving this gift to the SNP? What we need is an amendment to this motion to ensure that when there are Barnett consequentials, there are not two classes of Members, and that the Scots, the Welsh and anybody else can vote during the entire process. That is a perfectly fair amendment and a compromise. The House might not like that, but at least it will ensure, Mr Speaker, that you are not put in the invidious position of having to certify a Bill that the Government may tell you affects only England, but that, because of Barnett consequentials, affects Scotland too. It is well known that I believe that we should get rid of the Barnett formula and replace it with a needs-based formula and that we should give full fiscal autonomy to our Scottish friends, which would solve all these problems. But the Secretary of State for Scotland has resisted those amendments, so we are where we are.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.5/3">I finish on this point. The Conservative party is always best when it recognises that the Union is asymmetrical. We do not believe in neat constitutional solutions, as advocated by our liberal friends. We are a party of tradition and history and we recognise that our nation is asymmetrical. The English, who comprise 85% of the population, must take a bit of stick on this&#8212;carry a bit of a burden. We must recognise that, occasionally, the West Lothian question cannot always be resolved. We know that, but we must be generous on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.224.5/4">In the few seconds left to me, I make one final appeal to the Secretary of State. Let us at least allow proper time for debate, and let us get this right.</p>

What I say to the Government is that their proposal is muddled and incoherent, and will lead to many problems and a very fractious House of Commons, which really should be the forum in which we bind together this United Kingdom. When various questions have been raised today, the response has been lacking in clarity. Sometimes we will have votes in which English MPs only can take part. Occasionally, we will have votes in which Northern Ireland MPs, Welsh MPs or Scottish MPs can participate. That is a recipe for divisiveness in this House and it plays to the separatists&#8217; agenda, and not to the integrity of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.225.2/1">I value Scotland&#8217;s place in the United Kingdom, and I will fight passionately for the right of Scottish MPs to have a say in matters that affect Scotland. The point that was made about the Barnett consequentials is very important. We lack clarity, and we need clarity in this discussion.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/2">When it comes to legislation in Northern Ireland, we have different types of devolution. For example, an important issue in Northern Ireland at this time of year is the question of parading, which is a non-devolved matter. We are in ongoing discussions between the political parties, and we hope to come up with a new system for dealing with parades. We need it badly, but it will be this House that will legislate on the new system. What if we follow the logic of the argument that is being made? As it is a matter that affects only Northern Ireland, only Northern Ireland MPs would be able to vote on it. That is muddled thinking. I am not suggesting that that should be the case, but how do we define what is and is not devolved? Parading is a non-devolved matter, but elements of the legislation would be devolved. Policing is a devolved issue, as is justice, and those things impact on parading, so where do we draw the line? That is my difficulty with the Government&#8217;s proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.225.2/3">The Democratic Unionist party recognises that the issue needs to be addressed. There have been comments about the need for generosity on the part of the English, and I recognise that the question is important to people who live in England and needs to be addressed, but this is the wrong way to do it. I agree entirely with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11545" name="Ed Miliband">the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>, and the DUP supported the concept of a constitutional convention. The Union is too important. The integrity of the United Kingdom is too important to be left to a debate on Standing Orders in this House. That is not how we should be dealing with these issues, and I say that as a passionate Unionist.</p>

	<p pid="b.226.1/1">All I am saying is that it places you, Mr Speaker, as the Speaker of this House of Commons, in an invidious position. You will have to adjudicate on these matters daily and I do not think that is how we should deal with the question of how to handle English laws. It requires a much wider constitutional debate and this is not the appropriate way to defend and protect the integrity of the United Kingdom. It raises too many questions and, frankly, plays into the hands of those who want to go down the road of separation. Will we look back in a few years&#8217; time and rue the day that this happened?</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/2">I do not for a moment believe that the Leader of the House is acting out of any other motivation than a desire to address this issue, and to do so from a Unionist perspective, but I cannot agree with the method that he is suggesting. We need to go back to the drawing board and to find a way forward on which we can all agree. That is why there is a need for greater discussion and I would welcome more engagement with the Leader of the House on these questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/3">This proposal raises many issues about how the matter will be handled in the future. For example, a lot of legislation for Northern Ireland and other parts of the kingdom is dealt with by Orders in Council and statutory instruments. We need to tease out how all that will be handled. Points have been made about the Barnett</p>
	<p pid="b.226.1/4">consequentials and this is important, because, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> mentioned, we have a crisis in the Northern Ireland Executive over welfare reform. We have full legislative devolution on welfare reform, but the difficulty is that the Treasury has made it clear that we must implement welfare reform as it applies in the rest of the United Kingdom or we will not get any more money. How do we handle such issues in this House? How do we, as Northern Ireland MPs, have an influence on that issue in this House? I cannot see the answer to that in the Government&#8217;s proposals. That is why I think that there is a need for a deeper and wider discussion on these issues. This is too important to be left to a one-day debate on Standing Orders in this House. That is why today the DUP is joining others with whom we might not see eye to eye on constitutional issues. We want the best for the United Kingdom and, frankly, this proposal is far from the best.</p>

Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase> on securing this debate, which was badly needed. I do not want to rehearse all the issues that have been raised about how we got ourselves to this position, but it seems to me that it was inherent in the devolution settlement of 1998 that the questions we are now discussing would have to be addressed. The truth is that we have ducked them consistently and for a long period. Indeed, we have done more than that and have created over time legislation that is often incoherent and difficult to understand, particularly in the Welsh context of devolution, and legislation that did not meet the needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.227.0/2">The problem we now have is that there is a ghost in the room as well. We will have to move towards using Standing Orders because we do not wish to have a measure carried out in this Chamber through the ordinary legislative process, which is justiciable. That raises the whole question of whether we are moving inevitably towards a written constitution. The House has consistently set itself against that, but we are asking our unwritten constitution to stretch more and more to respond to complexities for which it was never designed. I do not believe that it will in the long term be able to cope. However, that is the reality of our position and it requires a sea change in opinion in this House if we are ever to get ourselves through it. It also requires good will. Forgive my having to say this again to SNP members, but one of the problems with these debates is that the question of their good will towards the United Kingdom in general is rather in doubt and for that reason, achieving a sensible dialogue is made much more difficult.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.3/1">I would like to make progress. I know that the hon. Gentleman is interested in this question, but I want to get on to my main points.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.3/2">My concern, and this is why I raised it yesterday, is that the only way in which my party will honour its vow to the electorate is by proceeding by way of amending Standing Orders. We certainly should not underestimate the enormity of that change. It is a profound change and needs to be properly debated. At the moment, I have serious anxieties about whether there is time available to carry out that scrutiny. I know that the Government have set aside a day next week, but it does not seem to me that that allows the opportunity at present to table the necessary amendments, to consider the 22 clauses and changes one by one so that Members of this House can make an informed assessment of whether they want to support some and not others, and to have the level of debate that will be required if this is to be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.3/3">The point has been rightly made about the Barnett consequentials. I have said on previous occasions that I fully accept that, in view of how we carry out our funding in the United Kingdom, many measures that might appear only to affect England and Wales have a consequence north of the border and a legitimate interest for Scottish Members to vote on. I wish to see that preserved. I happen to think that the Barnett formula is due for review and well past its sell-by date. I very much regret that, following the referendum last year, we seem to have reaffirmed something which even a Committee of the Scottish Parliament had indicated was becoming increasingly unworkable and not in anybody&#8217;s&#8212;including Scotland&#8217;s&#8212;interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.3/4">But that is where we are. We have to work with what we have got. If we are to proceed, the changes to those Standing Orders must be properly scrutinised, and we must do it in a way that commands confidence both here and among the public. I have to say to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House that I do not think we are there. I hope very much that before the close of today we will hear that sufficient time is to be allocated to do justice to these proposals. We can then have a proper debate and reach outcomes which, though they may be far from perfect&#8212;I acknowledge that&#8212;nevertheless are not so imperfect that I feel rather ashamed of our having perpetrated them. I very much hope that we will take the opportunity in today&#8217;s debate to ensure that we can have that proper debate next week.</p>

	<p pid="b.228.4/1">I am strongly in favour of a distinct English voice in so-called English-only legislation, but I am totally, implacably against the proposals before us today. There are four reasons for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.4/2">The first is that the proposals create two classes of Members of Parliament for the first time in our history: English Members of Parliament and everyone else&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.228.4/3">Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish. That is a fundamental departure from what we have seen in British constitutional arrangements since time immemorial. The proposals do this by giving a veto to English Members. The political and constitutional result will be that a great deal of resentment is created throughout the whole of the United Kingdom. The proposals are fundamentally anti-United Kingdom. They create division and discord. We should be pulling together, not pulling apart.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.4/4">Secondly, the proposals do not understand the reality of asymmetrical devolution in modern Britain, and do not understand the new relationship that exists between the nations of the United Kingdom. That relationship is more important than ever before, but the proposals do not acknowledge that the largest part of our Union is England, with 85% of the population. What happens in England inevitably has a huge impact on what happens in the rest of the United Kingdom, especially with an asymmetrical devolution arrangement. I am a Welshman and proud of it. I am British as well, but I recognise that legislation determined in England has a huge impact on Wales, and Welsh Members should be involved in the determination of that legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.228.4/5">The border between English and Wales is porous. It is not a hard and fast border. What happens in England has a huge impact on what happens in all parts of Wales, particularly in border areas and particularly in north-east Wales. There is often cross-border movement, with people from one part of the country going to visit hospitals in another part of the country. Therefore what happens in the English health service, for example, affects people in Wales, and there should be some facility to allow us to make that point.</p>

	<p pid="b.229.1/1">I am all in favour of dialogue and of different opinions being taken into account. What I am against is people effectively being vetoed out of any possible arrangements. That is very harmful.</p>
	<p pid="b.229.1/2">Let me give another example of how the proposals could deny Wales a legitimate voice in the deliberations of this House. We may well see in the near future legislation for a new runway at Heathrow. It could be decided by a planning application or by a hybrid Bill. If such a Bill comes before the House of Commons, it will have a huge impact on the people of Wales. We will be strongly in favour of an extra runway at Heathrow. It will have a huge and positive impact on Wales, yet we will be excluded from any say or deliberation on that. That is fundamentally unfair. There would be an English veto against us if we promoted something that would favour Welsh interests, when it legitimately should do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.229.2/1">My hon. Friend identifies an important point, which is the determination of what is an English issue? The point that he has just made shows that something that may appear on the surface to be an English issue actually has a great effect on Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.2/1">Members will have a debate, but their voice and their vote will be worth a heck of a lot less. They will be made second class, and the right hon. Gentleman cannot get away from that reality. He is creating second-class Members in this House and fuelling English nationalism.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.2/2">The third reason why I am fundamentally opposed to these arrangements has been admitted&#8212;the proposals do not take account of the funding arrangements that exist within the United Kingdom, especially the Barnett consequentials. Decisions will be made in this House which have a huge bearing on Wales and other parts of the UK, and Welsh Members will not have a full participatory role. That is morally wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.2/3">Finally, I am against these proposals because they are complex, incoherent, unclear and obtuse. I am particularly concerned that there is no process of consultation of the House of Lords, yet there is a new procedure for dealing with amendments from the other place&#8212;amendments that might well be worthy of consideration. They will be subject to a new voting procedure but will not be fully debated.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.2/4">As other Members have said, I am extremely concerned about the new and onerous responsibilities that will be placed on Mr Speaker. One of the great strengths of this Parliament and of this House of Commons is that we have as the Speaker someone who is objective and impartial and has the confidence of the whole House. It is a huge mistake to drag the role of the Speaker into deliberations about what is English-only legislation or clauses, because that is effectively politicising the role. That is something that the House and democracy will live to regret.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.2/5">Therefore I am extremely concerned about the proposals before us. I am extremely worried about the way they are being rushed through this House. I urge the Conservative party, in the interests of democracy and in the interests of the United Kingdom, to think again, please.</p>

	<p pid="b.230.3/1">I am grateful to be called in this debate. I am unusual in that, having represented North Wales for some time and having seen devolution in action in the Welsh Assembly, I find myself over the border, representing an English constituency where the voices of my constituents cannot be heard in the way that my constituents in Wales were heard. I would have had a great deal of sympathy for the Opposition, but these arguments were known at the time of the asymmetrical devolution settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.3/2">My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10243" name="Dominic Grieve">the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve)</phrase> spoke powerfully about the impact of an Act and why it is so important to introduce these proposals through Standing Orders. We saw with the Agricultural Sector (Wales) Act 2014 how powers given away from this place by Act were changed by</p>
	<p pid="b.230.3/3">judicial law making. That effectively changed the constitutional settlement in Wales and made it a reserved powers model, expressly contradicting the provisions of the Bill. Furthermore, that substantially delayed the impact of legislation and changed the settled will of this House through judge-led law making.</p>
	<p pid="b.230.3/4">It is for those reasons that many Members on the Government Benches have considerable concerns about a written constitution. I hear the cries for a constitutional convention, but the opportunity was there in 1999 and the vital question of English votes for English laws was not addressed, and it should have been. To paraphrase what my right hon. and learned Friend said in another debate, &#8220;If not now, when?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.230.3/5">We need this change. English voters are increasingly resentful. Research shows a consistent message that the people of England do not think that it is right that MPs from Scotland should be allowed to vote in the House of Commons on laws that affect only England. That research is from the National Centre for Social Research. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Does <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24797" name="Owen Smith">the hon.

	<p pid="b.232.2/1">I am grateful, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to address the House on the occasion of this debate on English votes for English laws, which is an issue that will have a substantial impact on the constituency that I represent&#8212;the one and only West Dunbartonshire. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10785" name="Alistair Carmichael">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase> on bringing this emergency motion to the House&#8212;well played, sir!</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/2">Before I proceed, I wish, with your approval, Mr Speaker, as I make my first speech, to address not only you but, directly, the communities of the great burgh of Clydebank, the ancient burgh of Dumbarton, and the mighty Vale of Leven. Knowing the constituency as well as I do, and knowing that that community expects the very best of its Members of this House, I would like to acknowledge my predecessor, Gemma Doyle, who carried out that role with dedication and conviction. I wish Gemma all the very best for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/3">Since taking a seat on these green Benches&#8212;forgive my very sore throat, Mr Speaker&#8212;I have heard Members from various parties stress the importance of engaging with the population of these islands. Well, we seem to have had a profound failure within three months in the presentation of these proposals by the Leader of the House. A number of Members have spoken of our need to lead. I believe that this is the wrong approach and that it has failed this House miserably, given that an engaged population in Scotland&#8212;a physically engaged population&#8212;has returned my 55 hon. Friends, as well as myself, to this House. They are engaged and dynamic and have brought us in force to this House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/4">My perspective on how we should lead and how we should engage is about the failure of the political process of this political state. It is not our job to lead; the communities who elect us should dictate the terms of our presence and the policies that we bring forward to this House. I invite you to come north to the 59 constituencies of Scotland&#8212;the greatest, of course, is West Dunbartonshire&#8212;if you want to see an engaged population. The people of Scotland and of my community have gained a new-found confidence in themselves and in the country that is Scotland. That sends a strong message to those in this House, on both sides, about who should lead and who should follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/5">I am deeply honoured to represent my constituency. It is home to three of the greatest communities of the</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/6">industrial age and also inextricably linked to the horrors of war and devastation and the legacy of conflict. Its story is not often relayed in Chambers as grand as this.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/7">Clydebank is my home town. It gave birth, along with Dumbarton and the towns of the lower Clyde, to the greatest ships in modern maritime history. My grandfather worked on the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth. My father, a coppersmith by trade, worked on the Queen Elizabeth as well as the QE2&#8212;and, by rights, I should have followed suit. Not to be outdone, our close neighbours in that ancient burgh of Dumbarton built the world-famous Cutty Sark, which lies not far from this House. One of the last tea clippers to be launched, it was heavily involved in expanding overseas trade and sailed to all corners of the globe.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/8">From the towns of Clydebank and Dumbarton, we go to the villages of Duntocher, Gartocharn, Old Kilpatrick and Bonhill, not forgetting the people&#8217;s republic of the Renton, as well as the Faifley. My constituency contains a great deal of history unmatched by many others. Although it is not commonly known in these parts, the Vale of Leven takes great pride in having a part of it in every corner of the globe through having produced and exported &#8220;Turkey red&#8221; dyed and printed cottons.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/9">It is often said that politicians have people in their lives who they see as heroes; I have none. I see heroes as mystical creatures of fantasy who are to be found in the pages of comics wearing their underwear on the outside. Other than heroes, however, I have those who inspire me such as the members of my family who survived the Clydebank blitz&#8212;people such as my father, my late mother, and many others.</p>
	<p pid="b.232.2/10">On the matter of the vote before us, critically, Mr Speaker, this proposal places you directly, and those who come after you, in a precarious position. It denigrates the position of the Chair of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Finally, I am no Unionist or home ruler, but I will stand shoulder to shoulder with Members on all Benches to ensure that your integrity and dignity, Mr Speaker, and those of the people who come after you, are maintained as we work as politicians in this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.233.1/2">I speak as a Scot who represents a seat in England, who regards his nationality as British and who is a staunch Unionist. It is because I am a staunch Unionist that I support the measures under discussion. This issue is not new. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24926" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg)</phrase> has said, it has been around for more than a century. It is four decades since Tam Dalyell brought it up and two decades since devolution legislation went through this House. It is time we had an answer to the West Lothian question. This issue goes with the grain of public opinion on both sides of the border. All the opinion poll evidence north and south of</p>
	<p pid="b.233.1/3">the border shows support for English votes on English laws, and I congratulate the Government on introducing the measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.233.1/4">I only have time to make one substantive point. I grew up in Scotland in the 1980s, when the devolution argument was coming to its fore. At the core of the argument was the question: what legitimacy did the United Kingdom Government have to legislate for Scotland on matters on which Scottish Members disagreed? Devolution addresses that. Why cannot that question also apply to England?</p>
	<p pid="b.233.1/5">I would have a lot of sympathy for the argument rehearsed in today&#8217;s debate if we were discussing excluding Members from debating and voting on bits of legislation, but that is not what is being discussed. All we are doing is inserting into legislation that applies only to England the same principle of consent that applies elsewhere in the country. That is fair. It is a modest proposal.</p>

This country has a flexible constitution and it should evolve to take account of the new realities. That is fair for my constituents. It will strengthen the Union. Doing nothing will endanger it.</p>

	<p pid="b.234.2/1">First, may I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25275" name="Martin Docherty">the hon. Member for West Dunbartonshire (Martin John Docherty)</phrase> on a truly magnificent maiden speech? He was unfortunate that his time was limited, but I am sure the House will hear more from him in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/2">If there were any doubt about the need for this debate, it has surely been dispelled by the way in which it has been conducted and by its content. Several issues have come to light. First, the Government are going to create two tiers of MP: that will be the inevitable consequence of their double majority. Secondly, English Members of Parliament will have a veto, but, according to the Leader of the House, a veto will not be afforded to the Scottish Parliament, because the Government insist on the continuation of the Sewel convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/3">The most important issue, and that which causes most concern, is the politicisation of your role, Mr Speaker, because you will be put in the position of having to arbitrate on these questions and then not have to give any reasons for your decision. Surely that means that we will be left to speculate on the Chair&#8217;s reasons, and such speculation cannot be sensible or, indeed, healthy in a political forum. We will be excluded not from debate, but from decisions. That is no way to run a Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25363" name="Antoinette Sandbach">The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Antoinette Sandbach)</phrase> said that she was acting on the resentment of her constituents. I do not doubt that that resentment is real, but I invite her to reflect on whether that is really the proper basis on which to proceed with changes of this sort. What she is supporting will merely reinforce that resentment, rather than address the underlying reasons for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/5">I am not going to burst into song, but if I were I would turn to the late great Johnny Nash, who said:</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/6">&#8220;There are more questions than answers</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/7">And the more I find out, the less I know&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.234.2/8">I am afraid that that is where we are.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. We have today seen the Government abstain from voting on the process of introducing English votes for English laws because they knew they had lost the argument. What more can we do to prevent the Government from railroading these controversial changes through the House in one single day of debate? They have not even bothered to vote to support the process that they decided to implement.</p>

	<p pid="b.237.2/2">There is a sense in which the hon. Lady&#8217;s point of order contains a rhetorical question, and it is fair to say that the Government abstained on the question before the House, namely that this matter has been considered. A point has been made; nothing has been decided.</p>

On both sides of the Chamber, most of us detected a feeling that, at the very minimum, a lot more discussion needs to be had before any such measure is railroaded&#8212;if the Government have the power to do that any more&#8212;through this House of Commons. Is that not the import of the massive vote against the Government we have just had?</p>

	<p pid="b.238.4/1">In response to the right hon. Gentleman, it is clear to me that there are many Members in all parts of the House who believe that more time is required. It is not for the Chair to decree that, but many Members in all parts of the House and of all hues of political opinion have indicated that that is their view. I am sure that view will have been heard. What is more, if the right hon. Gentleman is dissatisfied that it has been adequately heard, I have a feeling that he will practise, perfectly properly, the repetition principle, and that he will keep making the point until he is satisfied that it has been heard.

	<p pid="b.238.5/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. There is another way of looking at this event. The Government introduced this idea with a lot of bravado. The truth is that they failed to convince a majority on their side. They have a majority of 12. Most of the Opposition were in the No Lobby. It is now evident that some of the Government&#8217;s supporters were not prepared to walk through the Aye Lobby and decided to pull the plug. A decent Government would resign.</p>

	<p pid="b.240.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that people should be given support and incentives to find employment and stay in employment; notes that, at a time when the recovery is still fragile for many, the impact of a significant reduction in in-work tax credits could increase hardship and undermine the importance of making work pay; believes that any meaningful effort to address the real causes of high welfare costs should tackle the underlying drivers of low pay, housing costs and insecure working conditions; further notes that the threat of a &#163;5 billion reduction in child tax credits would see 3.7 million working families lose an average of &#163;1,400 a year in income; and urges the Chancellor to guarantee that any assistance in the July 2015 Budget is focused solely on people on middle and low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/3">I am pleased that we have finally come on to our Opposition day debate. It was postponed last week and has been delayed today owing to the emergency debate on English votes for English laws. It is important that we have this debate ahead of the Budget, because what the Government decide to do tomorrow in relation to tax credits will show up the rhetoric they have been using since the election and prove whose side they are really on. It is not the side of working people. They say that they are now the workers&#8217; party. Indeed, the Chancellor&#8217;s op-ed in <i>The Sun</i> this weekend started with the line:</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/4">&#8220;We were elected in May as a party for working people; that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ll govern; and that&#8217;s who my budget this week is for.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/5">On reading that line for the first time on Sunday morning, I would have choked on my cereal were it not for the fact that it is Ramadan and I am fasting. Saying it&#8212;asserting it&#8212;simply does not make it true. It is about what we do and the choices we make. If the decision the Government make tomorrow on tax credits is as we expect, it will prove that their rhetoric is very far removed from the reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.240.2/6">We know from what the Chancellor said over the weekend that &#163;12 billion of savings from the welfare budget have been found. It is reported that a substantial chunk of that money will come from cuts to tax credits. Certainly, the Government&#8217;s attempts to discredit the tax credits regime suggest that they are laying the groundwork ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s Budget. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that the Government could cut the childcare element of child tax credit back to its 2003-04 level, saving &#163;5.1 billion per year. The IFS says that a &#163;5 billion cut in tax credits in this way would mean some 3.7 million families losing &#163;1,400 a year on average and would push a further 300,000 children into relative poverty. Those are huge sums of money for working people on low pay&#8212;people who are trying to do the right thing, who are at the mercy of a labour market that, at the lower end, is insecure and of high housing costs that keep going up and up. Without tax credits to help them through, those who are working and stuck on low pay simply cannot make ends meet.</p>

	<p pid="b.242.5/1">The hon. Lady makes a powerful point, and I absolutely agree with her. Of course, it was the support available via tax credits that meant that in the recession some people could remain in work even</p>
	<p pid="b.242.5/2">when their employers had to cut back on their hours as a result of the global financial crisis. That is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.5/3">The Government&#8217;s critique of tax credits over the last couple of weeks has implied that this is a flawed regime that does not work and simply subsidises so-called poverty pay, but a simple examination of the facts shows that the case undermining tax credits is weak. If the Government were serious about tackling the reasons why people have to rely on tax credits, they would come forward tomorrow not with planned cuts or immediate cuts to tax credits, but with longer-term measures to tackle the underlying factors of low pay, high housing costs and insecure employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.242.5/4">There are 4.6 million households in the UK claiming tax credits. Four million of the families claiming them have children and 2.7 million of those families are in work. There are 5 million children in working families receiving tax credits, and over 70% of all of those, with or without children, claiming tax credits are in work. They were introduced in 2003 to tackle poverty and make work pay. Much of the debate at the time was focused on helping single parents to get into work. We know that the lone parent employment rate rose by 28% between 1997 and 2010, and by a staggering 43% between 1997 and 2014.</p>

	<p pid="b.244.0/1">In the end, it is about building more houses. That is something that this Government have singularly failed to do over the five years during which they have already been in government. In view of what is being briefed ahead of the Budget tomorrow, it does not seem to me that they are going to come forward with a game-changing plan when it comes to house building in our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/2">Tax credits and child poverty are inextricably linked. The same Resolution Foundation study of 2012 found that there was a clear inverse link between spending on tax credits and child poverty rates. The latest households below average income figures show that progress in tackling child poverty has ground to a halt since this Government came to office, with 2.3 million children remaining in relative poverty and 2.6 million in absolute poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/3">The Work and Pensions Secretary spent most of last week trying to distract from the Government&#8217;s record on child poverty, first by trying to claim a win on child poverty on the basis that the figures were not as bad as some suggested they might have been&#8212;in itself indicative of a shocking complacency&#8212;and then by changing the definition of child poverty. The reality remains that too many children in our country struggle with a poor and difficult start in life that directly impacts on their life chances as adults. If not dealt with early, this means that we will all face higher costs further down the track. As I mentioned, the IFS says that cutting &#163;5 billion-worth of tax credits tomorrow will push a further 300,000 children into relative poverty. Tax credit cuts will do nothing to address child poverty; they will simply add to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.244.0/4">Government Members would have us believe that by cutting tax credits, wages will automatically rise to compensate workers, but that is simply not going to happen. Employers will not give everyone a pay rise on the day the Chancellor cuts tax credits. As I said, the national minimum wage would have to rise by 25% overnight to compensate a lone parent working 16 hours a week for the loss of tax credit, and the wage of a worker on average earnings of &#163;22,000 a year would have to rise by 6% overnight. That would require employers to raise pay overnight by twice the amount by which the Office for Budget Responsibility has said that they will raise pay over a full year, and we know that there is not a chance in hell that that will happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.246.0/1">I am afraid that the boy-band operation on the Government Back Benches is a little unimpressive. Rather than give way for a further Whip&#8217;s question, I shall make a little more progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/2">Another argument advanced by Government Members in recent weeks is that tax credits have been subsidising poverty pay. There is academic and expert evidence that they have not depressed wages at the lower end, and that there has been no general slippage in the part of the earnings distribution where they bite. For the sake of argument, however, let us agree that in an ideal world we would not even take the risk that tax credits might depress wages, or subsidise low or poverty pay. Indeed, let us agree that we would ideally want a system in which they were not needed at all, because everyone could earn a high enough wage to manage perfectly well without them. If the Government were serious about that, they would come forward first with proper and realistic proposals for increasing wages and tackling low pay, and then start thinking about reform of tax credits. Instead, they are putting the cart before the horse and doing things the wrong way round, salami-slicing the tax credits budget but without any credible plan to get wages up before the cuts bite. The Government have no plans to ensure working families do not lose out from their tax credit cuts.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.0/3">Instead of tackling low pay, the Conservatives are attacking the low paid, and they have form: they cut tax credits 14 times in the last Parliament, including cutting the childcare element of working tax credits from 80% to 70% of a child&#8217;s childcare costs, costing some working families up to &#163;1,560 a year&#8212;an average loss of &#163;570 per year&#8212;and increasing the working hours threshold for couples to qualify for WTC from 16 to 24 hours per week, with an average loss of &#163;2,600 for families unable to increase their working hours, according to research commissioned by us from the House of Commons Library. We also know that there are a number of indicators to suggest that the recovery is not feeding through to job security and pay growth for those who have to rely on tax credits.</p>

	<p pid="b.246.4/1">I am going to make a little more progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/2">As I have said, we also know that a number of indicators suggest that the recovery is not feeding through to job security and pay growth for those who have to rely on tax credits. The number of jobs in low-paid sectors grew at twice the rate of those in non-low-paid sectors between the second quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2014. The number of working people paid housing benefit has risen by 400,000 since 2010,</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/3">because working people are not bringing home enough money to pay the rent. The number of people earning less than the living wage has increased by 1.8 million since 2009. Now it seems that these same people&#8212;the strivers, the doers and the workers whom the Chancellor claims to want to put his arms around and hug close&#8212;are, having been hit hard over the last five years, going to bear the brunt again.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/4">Labour believes the way into work and off welfare is by tackling the real causes of high welfare costs: the underlying drivers of low pay, high housing benefit costs and insecure working conditions. The Government&#8217;s failure to address these underlying causes in a meaningful way over the past five years has meant they have spent &#163;25 billion more than they expected to spend on welfare in 2010. The welfare bill remains higher than expected for the same reason as the deficit remains high: we cannot disconnect what happens in household budgets from the economy overall, and that means we cannot remove tax credits for working people without creating the conditions which allow that to be done in a way that does not penalise workers on low pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/5">We want a higher-wage economy where people are less reliant on tax credits to make ends meet. That is why we set out plans to raise the minimum wage to at least &#163;8 an hour by 2019, and it is why we support the living wage and set out proposals in our manifesto to encourage and incentivise business to pay it. I strongly encourage the Government to steal our policy, and if they do steal it they should do so as a first step to embedding higher wages in the economy before they consider going ahead with any changes to tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/6">The Government also should remember that the way in which the living wage is set assumes that families are already taking up their full tax credits entitlement. The Greater London Authority, which works out the London living wage, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/7">&#8220;If means-tested benefits were not taken into account (that is, tax credits, housing benefits and council tax benefit) the Living Wage would be approximately &#163;11.65 per hour.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/8">That is more than &#163;2 higher than it is at the moment. The living wage already has tax credits priced in, and it will not be a living wage in the face of tax credit cuts. If the Government come forward tomorrow with proposals on the living wage, they will have to explain either that they are going to go for a much higher living wage than we have at the moment or why they are going to hit working people again and again.</p>
	<p pid="b.246.4/9">The proposed tax credit cuts tomorrow have attracted widespread criticism across the political spectrum. Everyone agrees that people should be better off in work than unemployed, but removing or significantly cutting tax credits without having charted a course towards a high-skill, high-wage economy means that this Government are not tackling low pay, but are attacking the low paid. That is wrong; those people will be punished for circumstances outside their control as they try to do the right thing. Hon. Members from across the House should send a clear signal to the Government that that is wrong approach and vote in favour of our motion.</p>

It was only because of the difficult decisions that we took that we were able to restore credibility to the UK as an economy and that we were able to make the progress that we made. Labour said that it is committed to closing the deficit. It voted for the Charter for Budget Responsibility, and the shadow Chancellor told us at the weekend that the Government should run a surplus in normal years. It is therefore disappointing that the Opposition have not yet set out how they will do so, because if they continue to oppose finding savings in the welfare budget they will have to explain whether they would borrow more, tax more or cut departmental spending more.</p>

	<p pid="b.250.2/1">Let me put this as simply as possible. The debt is essentially the accumulation of deficit and for the past five years every measure that the Government took to reduce the deficit was opposed by Labour. Indeed, Labour&#8217;s economic argument&#8212;its whole case&#8212;was that we were going too far, too fast in reducing the deficit and that we should have a looser fiscal policy. A looser fiscal policy means borrowing more. If we borrow more, the debt will rise more quickly. The hon. Lady cannot have it both ways. She can argue that we should have been prepared to borrow more and to allow the debt to rise because that was a price worth paying, but she cannot then turn around and say, &#8220;We want the debt to be lower, even though our policies called for higher debt.&#8221;</p>

On the question of the fear of further crises and so on, we need to ensure that the public finances are on a sound footing, recognising that there will be times at which there will be turbulence in the economy. This is one of the differences we had at the general election. The Government recognise that we have to be serious about getting debt down, which is why we believe that there should be a surplus in normal years. If the Opposition are coming to that view, I welcome it, but their refusal to consider a role for the welfare budget in making a contribution towards reducing the deficit suggests that their heart is not in it.</p>

On tax credits alone, in 2010-11, nominal spending had increased by an extraordinary 180% compared to the benefits they replaced. Worse, the benefits system as it stood created the most perverse incentive of all: for some people it made financial sense to choose to live on benefits rather than earn a living. It rewarded doing the wrong thing, punished doing the right thing, alienated millions of hard-working people and let down millions more. It was financially and morally unsustainable.</p>

	<p pid="b.252.1/1">I fear that my hon. Friend is right. Given what we inherited, it was necessary to introduce wide, comprehensive reforms to reward work and allow people to fulfil their potential. We have cut taxes. We have capped benefits so that no household earns more in out-of-work benefits than the average household earns by working. We are simplifying the benefits system through the roll-out of universal credit. We tightened the rules to prevent abuse of the system and, perhaps most importantly, we ensured that there were decent, full-time jobs for people to go to. At the same time, we have ensured that benefits continue to help the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.252.1/2">Before I set out how we will continue to help working people to achieve their aspirations, I shall say a few words about tax credits. Tax credits have helped to support many of our most vulnerable families. Over the past five years, we have channelled the support they provide towards the people who need it most&#8212;for instance, by increasing the disability element of tax credit in line with the consumer prices index. The next five years will see us continue to roll out universal credit, which will simplify the complex web of benefits and tax credits currently in place.</p>

It will improve the incentives for people to work. It will target support at those who need it most. It will diminish the opportunities for fraud or simple error and it will make administering the system much more efficient. Universal credit is the most radical transformation of the welfare system we have ever seen, making it simpler, easier and fairer. Once it is fully implemented, it is estimated that it will increase the number of people in work and make households throughout the country better off.</p>

We have given 15 hours of free childcare entitlement to all three and four-year-olds, as well as to the poorest 40% of two-year-olds, and we are doubling that for families in which both parents work. We are extending the right to request flexible working to all. Through tax-free childcare we are giving 20% support on childcare costs, up to &#163;10,000 per child. Universal credit will increase the childcare support for low-income families to 85%. Our pupil premium and early-years pupil premium are giving schools, nurseries and childminders additional money to ensure that children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds do not fall behind. Through our childcare business grant scheme we have 4,500 new childminders and over 30,000 new childcare places.</p>

	<p pid="b.253.8/1">We will perform the required assessments, as we always do.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.8/2">The best way to prosperity is still employment. The past five years have seen a jobs miracle&#8212;1,000 jobs a day; 2 million in total. For every job lost in the public sector, the private sector has created over five and a half more. I simply do not accept Opposition claims that they have somehow been second-class jobs on part-time or zero-hours contracts. Over the past year 85% of jobs created have been full time and 92% have been high or medium skilled. Unemployment has fallen by 349,000</p>
	<p pid="b.253.8/3">people over the past year alone. That is 349,000 more people standing on their own two feet, and 349,000 households with greater financial security.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.8/4">We want to continue our fantastic record on jobs so that we achieve full employment in the UK. We are providing our young adults with a route to employment through a record number of apprenticeships, and we have committed to supporting 3 million new apprenticeships. We will work with our Jobcentre Plus network to provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships for young people leaving education.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.8/5">When people are in work, we will cut their taxes. We have increased the tax-free personal allowance for 27 million people, from &#163;6,475 to &#163;10,600 this year. That will rise to &#163;12,500 by the end of this Parliament. We will enshrine the concept of a tax-free minimum wage in law. We will also raise the 40p income tax threshold to &#163;50,000, because that should be for high earners, not middle earners. Already, a typical basic-rate taxpayer is paying &#163;905 less income tax than in 2010, and by 2017-18 we will have lifted over 3.7 million people out of income tax altogether.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.8/6">We have frozen fuel duty since 2011 and council tax since 2010. We have said that over the next five years we will not raise income tax, VAT or national insurance contributions. Our record low inflation is keeping down the cost of household goods. We have increased the national minimum wage by 3.1%&#8212;3.3% for 18 to 21-year-olds&#8212;thus benefiting over 1 million people. At the same time, wages have increased by 2.7% on the year for the three months to April. That all means more money in people&#8217;s pockets, more incentives to work, and a fundamental shift from dependency and towards productivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.253.8/7">Back in 2010 we were a country living beyond our means and with worrying signs of being addicted to that lifestyle. Whenever that is proved to be unsustainable&#8212;something that global markets have a habit of proving&#8212;the poorest and the most vulnerable are hit the hardest. That is what we wanted to avoid, and that is why we have strived so hard to turn around Britain&#8217;s economy. Despite the best efforts of the Labour party, which opposed every difficult decision we took on the path towards recovery, we have achieved a lot. We have shielded the most vulnerable and those on the lowest incomes and have asked those with the broadest shoulders to bear a heavier burden. We have given greater economic security and a higher standard of living to millions of people in this country. At every opportunity, we have stood up for those who want to work and do the right thing. We have promoted work and helped create the opportunities to work. We have helped people to achieve their goals and secure themselves a brighter future. We have done all this while cutting the deficit and creating the highest growth of any major advanced economies. It is a record we are proud of, and one we will continue.</p>

	<p pid="b.255.0/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/2">I congratulate the Labour party on bringing this most important debate to the House. Having listened to the Minister over the past 25 minutes, I think that we on the SNP Benches must live in a different world to the one that he lives in. When we revisit what has been happening over the past couple of weeks, with the scandal of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions coming to this Chamber and wanting to redefine how we measure child poverty, we can see that that indicates the scale of the problem we face. But the cat is now well and truly out of the bag. We listened to the Minister taunting the Labour party and accusing it of being the party of welfare. On these Benches, we see the importance of what we call social security in Scotland. We believe that society is as strong as its weakest link. The battle that we are facing in this Parliament is an ideological one with a Government who want to demonise the poor of this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/3">Let this House take the opportunity to say to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, before he rises to deliver his emergency Budget tomorrow, that he should not use the failure of the Government to fix the deficit as an opportunity to attack the poor and the disadvantaged in our society. In particular, the Government should pause and reflect on the importance of tax credits to those who rely on the contribution that they make to the household budgets of many of our citizens. Tax credits have a significant impact in raising the income of low-income households, particularly those with children. The tax credits system was designed as a key mechanism for tackling poverty and inequality, and the SNP firmly opposes any moves to gut it, as the Tories have hinted at doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/4">Tax credits require a significant amount of expenditure, which largely goes to supporting children in lower income families. In 2013-14, tax credit expenditure in Scotland was &#163;2 billion, supporting thousands of people on low incomes. The SNP recognises the vital role that tax credits play in providing such support, and that is why our manifesto proposed to protect their value by increasing tax credits annually in line with inflation.</p>
	<p pid="b.255.0/5">We need to go much further, however, and do more to raise wages, including raising the minimum wage, promoting the living wage and increasing the work allowance in universal credit. It is the delivery of real wage growth that will lead to a natural reduction in tax credits. These benefits cannot be removed at a time when many are on low pay.</p>

	<p pid="b.255.1/1">My hon. Friend is right to talk about the moral case and the position in which the poorest in our society are being put. The Conservative party also talks about</p>

	<p pid="b.256.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We hear much in this Chamber about productivity, but the reality is that over the past seven years productivity has fallen by 0.7%. Rather than attacking the poor, which is what the Government are doing, their Budget tomorrow should introduce a programme for investment in this country that will lead to a rise in real wages, improve productivity and negate the need for tax credits. Removing tax credits will not fix the problems this country is suffering.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/2">The failure of driving sustainable economic growth means that many people who are in work are in poverty. As a result, many of them rely on tax credits in order to put food on the table to give thousands of young people a decent start in life. There has to be dignity in work, and much has to be done to drive investment in our economy, enhance productivity and see a sustained rise in real wages.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/3">Tax credits are an investment in our people and, as a consequence, the future prosperity of our country. Tax credits have made an important contribution to tackling poverty and inequality. In 2013-14, 90% of tax credit expenditure went to families with an income of less than &#163;20,000. Families with children received an average of &#163;6,900, and families without children an average of &#163;2,200, from tax credits. That represents a very clear contribution to boosting incomes and tackling poverty and inequality. Tax credits help tackle in-work poverty and child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/4">It is worth noting that about 70% of tax credits go to families where somebody is in work, predominantly supporting low-income working families. Given that a majority of people in poverty are already in work, tax credits are thus a crucial tool to support working people.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/5">The Child Poverty Action Group estimates that the UK Government&#8217;s welfare cuts will push an additional 100,000 children in Scotland into poverty by 2020&#8212;and that does not take into account the additional &#163;12 billion-worth of cuts that this Government want to push through. Given that 500,000 children benefit from the tax credit system in Scotland, cuts to tax credits would certainly have a further detrimental impact on the wellbeing of children in Scotland and on child poverty figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.256.0/6">Figures due to be published tomorrow by the Scottish Government show that if the Chancellor cuts child tax credit back to 2003 levels in real terms, as has been reported, the poorest 20% of Scottish families with children will lose an average of nearly 8% of their income. That will have the impact of taking a total of &#163;425 million out of the Scottish economy. How are we to deliver sustainable growth when we take &#163;425 million out of the pockets of the poorest in our society? It beggars belief. We want a caring, compassionate society; that is not what we are getting from this Government.</p>

Some &#163;375 billion of new money has been created through the quantitative easing programme. We recognise that some of that was necessary, but it created circumstances in which those in the financial markets benefited massively. A 90% increase in the value of the FTSE 100 since 2009, a huge increase in the value of financial assets, and banker&#8217;s bonuses that continue to reach eye-watering figures are the impact of this Government&#8217;s political choices. They have created the circumstances that have delivered increased value in financial markets; they have not created the circumstances in which wages could rise and the country as a whole could benefit. &#8220;All in this together&#8221;?

	<p pid="b.257.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question, because we need a debate about that in the House. The real reason behind quantitative easing was exactly that&#8212;to produce an increase in bank lending&#8212;but if we look at what has happened over the past five or six years, we can see that there has hardly been a significant increase in bank lending. The money has gone into the financial markets and benefited the banks and the bankers, but we as a country have not seen the benefits that we should have had.

	<p pid="b.258.2/1">I will make some progress and then I will give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/2">The SNP firmly believes that we need to do far more to tackle poverty, and addressing inequalities is at the heart of the Scottish Government&#8217;s programme for Scotland. We challenge the UK Government to commit to a more ambitious rise in the minimum wage, and to follow the Scottish Government&#8217;s lead in paying all staff the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/3">The UK Government have already cut tax credits. In 2012, the eligibility threshold for child tax credit changed from a family income of &#163;41,000 to &#163;26,000 for lone parents and to &#163;32,000 for families with two children. The number of hours that couples with children had to work in order to be eligible for working tax credit went up from 16 hours a week to 24, with one parent having to work at least 16 hours. As a result of those changes, 11,370 Scottish families lost working tax credits worth up to &#163;3,870 per year and 73,300 Scottish families lost child tax credits worth about &#163;545 per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/4">More than 500,000 children in Scotland benefit from tax credits. Two thirds of the &#163;2 billion expenditure on tax credits in 2013-14 went to low-income families with children; only 5% went to households without children. That is why we are alarmed. Any removal of tax credits will clearly lead to an increase in child poverty. It is simply inhumane to consider such a move.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/5">In a speech last week, which was widely interpreted as a statement of intent to gut tax credits, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/6">&#8220;There is what I would call a merry-go-round. People working on the minimum wage having that money taxed by the government and then the government giving them that money back&#8212;and more&#8212;in welfare. Again, it&#8217;s dealing with the symptoms of the problem: topping up low pay rather than extending the drivers of opportunity&#8212;helping to create well paid jobs in the first place.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/7">Those comments suggest that the Tories are planning to target child tax credits and working tax credits, which provide support to low-income working people.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/8">Although we agree that we need to take urgent action to tackle low pay and raise wages, removing the vital support that tax credits give cannot be the answer. The SNP has set out a range of policies that aim to boost low incomes and drive wage growth. We have proposed raising the minimum wage to &#163;8.70 by 2020, raising the incomes of the lowest-paid in our society and reducing dependence on tax credits.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/9">The Scottish Government are the first living wage-accredited Government in the UK, and we are actively promoting the living wage by encouraging companies to sign up to our Scottish business pledge. We challenge the UK Government to follow suit and guarantee that all their staff will be paid the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/10">We want to see a &#163;600 increase in the work allowance of universal credit, which determines when people entering work begin to have their benefits reduced. That would support people on low incomes and boost the income of a worker who receives universal credit by &#163;390.</p>
	<p pid="b.258.2/11">Removing much need financial support for those on low incomes, in the form of tax credits, simply cannot help make work pay. The SNP wants to make work pay, but we must do so by raising incomes and tackling low pay.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.0/1">The problem with the Government&#8217;s suggestion that cutting tax credits will lead to higher pay is that the labour market is weighted in favour of the employer, rather than the worker. The only way to restore wage growth across the board, especially in the private sector, is through the expansion of collective bargaining. We simply cannot have wage growth in a country where the erosion of trade union rights is right at the top of the Tory agenda. The Government are doing the exact opposite of what they intend, which is to get people back to work and on decent pay&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.259.2/1">I agree with the gist of what the hon. Lady said. We need to ensure that there is proper protection for trade union rights throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.2/2">The Resolution Foundation, which has been much commented on, has assessed the proposed plans. It found that more than two thirds of the families affected&#8212;2.7 million of them&#8212;would be in work. Working families with two children would lose up to &#163;1,690 a year. Almost two thirds of the cut would be borne by the poorest 30% of households; almost none of the cut would fall on the richest 40% of households.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.2/3">A poll by YouGov and <i>The Sunday Times</i> the other week found that there was opposition across the UK to cuts in tax credits, and that the opposition was highest in Scotland: 56% of Scots are opposed to the cuts and only 37% are in favour. Clearly, there is public opposition to any attempt to target tax credits, and that opposition is strongest in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.2/4">The Tory assault on the welfare system is already pushing more and more people, particularly thousands of children, into poverty. There are worrying links between welfare reform and food bank use. The Trussell Trust has reported that 117,689 people picked up a three-day supply of groceries from Scottish food-banks in 2014-15, including 36,114 children. That is eight times the number of people who were helped just two years ago. Given the social harm that is already being done by Tory welfare cuts, the future damage that could be caused by gutting tax credits is unthinkable. The Tories&#8217; plans, and the high degree of uncertainty about the future of that lifeline support, demonstrate the need for full powers over Scotland&#8217;s welfare system to be in Scottish hands, not those of the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.</p>

	<p pid="b.259.3/1">I am delighted finally to have the opportunity to speak on this subject because I profoundly believe that tax credits are one of the greatest policy errors in the history of the welfare</p>
	<p pid="b.259.3/2">state. I say that not because of the Resolution Foundation, the International Monetary Fund or any theory; I say it because of my experience in the real world running a small business.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.3/3">Let me share two key experiences with the House. The first was when I set up as a mortgage broker in 2004. We focused on the shared ownership sector, so most of our applicants were on lower and middle incomes. I was distinctly surprised when I found that people could take out mortgages based on tax credits. It its wisdom the Financial Services Authority decided that that was suitable, and I would be interested to know whether there are any Treasury figures on the amount of credit&#8212;both secured and unsecured&#8212;that was taken out on the basis of tax credits, using other people&#8217;s money to borrow other people&#8217;s money, and reinforcing the double dependency at the core of the tax credit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.3/4">In my experience, the most serious issue with tax credits was when we started to recruit staff. In 2009, we embarked on our first round of pay rises after the great recession&#8212;Labour Members will be familiar with that&#8212;and I found it extraordinary when I received emails from staff declining those pay rises. Why did people not want a pay rise? One would expect anybody to want one&#8212;we all would; we want to get on in life. People rejected those pay rises because they would lose too much in tax credits, and that is the fundamental flaw in the tax credit system. I found that with various members of staff and parents at our school: people were in a dilemma about whether they should press on in life and try to earn more, even though they would lose money from tax credits and other benefits. I think that the tax credit policy is such a profound error because at a time of general prosperity we should not be seeking massively to expand the benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="b.259.3/5">Let us consider our three core economic challenges. The first is the productivity puzzle, but it is no puzzle to me that people do not become more productive or work harder when there is no incentive for them to do so. Secondly, why is it a surprise that we have flat wage growth when there is such a disincentive for millions of workers to earn more? Thirdly, and most importantly, we have a real problem with social mobility, which is frozen. Everybody talks about that problem, but why would someone try to get on in life and be socially mobile if the massively expanded benefit system does not reward them for doing so? That is fundamental. To me, the essence of the tax credit system is that we are spending &#163;30 billion a year to put a cap on the wages of British people and a ceiling on ambition and aspiration.</p>

Tax credits are a massive barrier&#8212;that is a fact even if no Labour Member will recognise it&#8212;and we are spending &#163;30 billion a year to put a ceiling on the aspiration and ambition of British working families. My hon. Friends</p>
	<p pid="b.260.1/2">and I believe in a safety net, but I do not believe in a ceiling. We should not put ceilings on ambition and hold people back from making the most of their natural talents and abilities. We should empower them to make the most of their skills.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.0/1">The hon. Gentleman thinks people are getting a king&#8217;s ransom in tax credits. The reality is that the Government are taking people on low pay that simply will not keep a person and their family and bringing them just to the breadline. They are not exactly incentivising them to stay in poverty. That is the crucial flaw in his argument.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.1/1">Of course it is not a king&#8217;s ransom. That is the point. We are trapping people on benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/2">At the end of the day, the money has to come from somewhere. Someone else has to earn the wages to pay for the tax credits of people who receive them. If we reduce them, people will have to be more productive, will have to work harder and will take alternative employment to make that up. That is what happens in the real world. I am proud to be in a party that is ready to take the tough decisions to deal with the fundamental problems we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/3">We must look at a solution to the problem the hon. Lady describes. Clearly, we cannot just cut the whole system overnight, but it is worth reflecting that, according to the House of Commons Library, if we spent the &#163;30 billion we spend on tax credits on education, we would have the best-funded education system in the European Union and the fifth best-funded system in the entire world.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.1/4">There are choices&#8212;to govern is to choose&#8212;and there is an opportunity cost to spending. My view is that we should reduce tax credits, increase the minimum wage over a long period towards the living wage and reduce employer&#8217;s national insurance with the savings we make so that employers can cope with the increase. That is a one nation policy. It is radical and tough. I say to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench: be brave, be bold and reform tax credits, because they will be helping working people who are being held back by that massive dependency culture.</p>

	<p pid="b.261.2/1">I thought South Suffolk was part of Britain, but it is perfectly obvious that it is not. The experience <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" name="James Cartlidge">the hon. Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge)</phrase> describes bears no relation whatever to reality or to the reality in the constituency I represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.2/2">Tomorrow, we will have a Budget. The Minister said we will hear about the Government&#8217;s long-term economic plan. I can tell the House what the Government&#8217;s long-term economic plan is: to him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not even that shall be taken away.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.2/3">The fact is that the inequality and inequity that has been deliberately created by the Government is an abomination to a country that is supposed to be a democracy. They have forced schools in my constituency to go into an academy system. I will visit one of those schools next week in one of the most deprived areas of my constituency. The Government forced it to go into a</p>
	<p pid="b.261.2/4">group and put in charge a woman called Dana Ross, who was the headteacher of Altrincham Grammar School for Girls. She has formed a group, Bright Futures, to run those schools. She has just increased her own pay from &#163;120,000 a year to &#163;220,000 a year. That is the kind of opportunity that this Government give to people.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.2/5">I represent a constituency of major deprivation, with some of the highest unemployment in the entire country. When I go back to my constituency and see how people are being victimised and deprived, it horrifies me. Let me give the House some statistics. My constituency&#8212;Manchester, Gorton&#8212;has the 10th highest level of child poverty in the UK out of 650 constituencies. My city, Manchester, is No. 4 among the top 20 local authorities with the highest level of child poverty in the UK. Forty-two per cent. of children in my constituency live in poverty. That is the direct result of the Government&#8217;s deliberate policies. They have created intolerable poverty in my constituency and they crow about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.2/6">The situation in my constituency, with regard to low-paid parents with dependent children who rely on tax credits to make up the difference between what they earn and what they need to get by, is that there are 21,300 children in families who receive tax credits. Cuts will hit working families with those low incomes the hardest, potentially meaning that more children will fall below the poverty line.</p>
	<p pid="b.261.2/7">Let us look at four statistics relating to tax credits. The number of families with children claiming tax credits in the Gorton constituency: 11,000. The number of working families with children claiming tax credits in the Gorton constituency: 6,800. The number of children in working families receiving tax credits: 14,800. The percentage of families in the Gorton constituency receiving tax credits: 79%. Tomorrow that lot on the Government Benches, who give money to the bankers and the property owners, are planning to victimise the people who live in that kind of poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.262.1/1">No, I am not going to give way to the hon. Lady, unless of course she has an intervention provided for her by her Whips like the rest of her colleagues who have intervened so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/2">Let us be clear about this: working-age households with the lowest incomes lost the most, as a proportion of their income, in the previous Parliament. In working-age households, the incomes of those with children have been hit hardest by the Government&#8217;s tax and benefit changes. Families with children have been hit the hardest of all. Working families with children lost up to &#163;2,000 a year, which is double the average loss of &#163;1,100. Cuts to tax credits far outweigh the increases in the personal allowance over the period. The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, in its state of the nation report for last year, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/3">&#8220;We have come to the reluctant conclusion that without radical changes to the tax and benefit system to boost the incomes of poor families, there is no realistic hope of the statutory child poverty targets being met in 2020.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.262.1/4">There will be radical changes tomorrow, but they will not be radical changes to help the people who live in my constituency. They are good, decent and hard-working</p>

	<p pid="b.263.0/1">It is a particular pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10327" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, the Father of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/2">Tax credit payments play an important role in the finances of many of my constituents, helping them to provide for childcare, meet ongoing expenditure and, crucially, join the workforce. My constituency is the prosperous town of Solihull, but there is still a legion of very hard-working people on not particularly high salaries who are helped by tax credits. I remember one door I knocked on in Shirley about a year or so before the general election. I met a young couple who told me that they both worked full time, brought up two children and earned something like about &#163;20,000 a year between them. They had to drive around in a 15-year-old car. Their lives were difficult financially and tax credits really helped them to get over a hump in the road. It would therefore be wrong to lose tax credits overnight without proper recompense through the tax system and other means of helping individuals. Incidentally, they also commented on how the state provided for people local to them who did not work, but had a much higher standard of living&#8212;a strong argument for a sensible cap on benefits, with which it seems that the shadow Chancellor now agrees.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/3">We should not pretend, however, that tax credits are perfect. When they were launched, there was a massive problem with over and underpayments&#8212;2 million instances in the first year alone&#8212;and this has not stopped. Okay, they are better managed by HMRC, but there is still a great deal of confusion in the tax credits system. If we were designing a system now to help people into work and to support families, would we really design tax credits with the inbuilt pitfall of overpayments that must then be clawed back, often to the great personal distress of the claimant?</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/4">There are also long-standing issues of fraud in the tax credits system. The online portal was closed in 2005 when tens of millions of pounds was defrauded, much of it by organised gangs from overseas. I remember reporting on the story in my capacity as BBC News personal finance correspondent and being told by officials that although it was unfortunate, the fraud was seen as a price worth paying to deliver the project. The phrase used was &#8220;spray and pay&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/5">In addition, there is an issue, touched on by hon. Members, about how tax credits effectively top up low pay in the economy. They are effectively a subsidy for big business. I note that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24788" name="Shabana Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> disputed this fact, but that august publication, <i>The Guardian,</i> carried a story on <phrase class="date" code="2015-04-20">20 April</phrase> saying that &#163;11 billion was being used to top up low pay through the tax credits system.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/6">There is also a strong cultural issue. Does it not damage society and individual entrepreneurialism to have so many people effectively in receipt of welfare and beholden to the state, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" name="James Cartlidge">the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge)</phrase> asked earlier? As we have seen in Greece and elsewhere, over-reliance on the state damages society and leaves individuals incredibly</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/7">vulnerable to global financial shocks, as well as domestic economic shocks. He made an interesting point about whether many loans now active are predicated on tax credits. Surely that needs to be investigated further by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/8">Also, it is possible that some governing parties have used tax credits as a means by which&#8212;heaven forbid&#8212;to curry favour with the electorate. We should not forget that the biggest rises in tax credits came just before the 2005 and 2010 general elections. Is it not significant as well that tax credit spend rose by 340% between 1997 and 2010, whereas average salaries rose by only 30%? Tax credits have increased by 10 times the level of average salaries, drawing more and more people into dependence on the state. There is also the wrongheaded situation of people on salaries far in excess of the national average being dragged into tax credits. In particular, single people often do not get any help whatsoever, yet the pattern in this country is of more single households being formed.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/9">No Government Member has so far suggested that tax credits should be done away with overnight. They should, however, be replaced slowly over time by a different, cleaner system less open to fraud and miscalculation. For me, increasing the personal allowance, from &#163;10,000 to &#163;12,500 and potentially beyond, is key. We should cut out the middle man. There is no need to claw cash back. It is also essential to raise the 40p personal allowance. There are many people paying tax at 40p in the pound who should not be; the system should not have been so designed that they have to pay it.</p>
	<p pid="b.263.0/10">We are doubling the amount of free childcare from 15 hours to 30 hours&#8212;a key means by which to enable people to get back into the workforce&#8212;while fuel duty is now 18p cheaper than it would have been under Labour&#8217;s plans, which has made a massive difference to family finances. In addition, ending the green levies on energy, including home energy supplies, should press down on home energy costs. In Solihull, we have just managed to freeze council tax for the fifth year on the trot&#8212;another means of delivering tax cuts, in effect, when compared to inflation, for working people. This has happened while unemployment in my constituency has fallen by 67% since 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.264.3/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.3/2">My answer to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25309" name="Peter Dowd">the hon. Member for Bootle (Peter Dowd)</phrase> is that we will find out a lot more about the future direction of tax credits and other welfare measures from the Chancellor&#8217;s Budget statement tomorrow, so we should wait on that announcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.264.3/3">I am running out of time, so let me say that I completely understand why tax credits were invented. They have done a lot of good in our society. There have, however, been unintended consequences. Worst of all, they are making millions of healthy, working-age adults reliant on cash from the state. We must preserve elements of the system for those trying to get into work, but we should augment it by active programmes of raising personal allowances and enhancing childcare provision.</p>

	<p pid="b.265.0/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak and share my thoughts today. Maiden speeches in this Chamber are quite different and unnerving, but I will grasp this opportunity to introduce myself and my constituency to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to my colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/2">Being a Member of this House is an honour and privilege that we all share, but to earn the trust of people we grew up with against a backdrop of one of the most vile and personalised election campaigns ever seen in Great Britain makes my smile just that extra bit broader as I stand here today. It is a further honour to be the first woman ever to represent the Bradford West constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/3">It is customary to say a few pleasant words about my predecessor&#8212;<i>[Laughter.] </i>I have many words, but sadly only a few pleasant ones. My predecessor was, I am told, a great orator. The sad truth is that the only words he ever directed towards me were misogynistic, vitriolic, very dangerous and, to quote him,</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/4">&#8220;only ever had a fleeting relationship with the truth&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/5">However, it would be most unwise of me not to compliment him on his sensational acting abilities, not forgetting, as demonstrated in &#8220;Big Brother&#8221;, his taste for red leotards and black hats. I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his actions, which united the people of Bradford West. Their patience&#8212;and, indeed, mine&#8212;certainly paid off when we handed him his P45 on <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-08">8 May</phrase>. The Spandex Cat has truly left the building.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/6">Despite continued attempts to undermine democracy, here I stand. For me, this speech is far from just my maiden speech; it signifies for me the unity of the people of Bradford West. Their voices, which for too long have not been heard, now demand not just to be heard, but to be listened to. My presence here is a testament to many people&#8212;my family, friends and local volunteers who were immensely supportive, and a close group of people who supported me throughout my campaign. These include my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11087" name="Khalid Mahmood">the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr Mahmood)</phrase>, Ben Gallagher, Jo Miller, the noble Baron, Lord Roy Kennedy, the noble Baroness Glenys Thornton and the many shadow Cabinet Ministers who came to visit and support me.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/7">It is also fitting to pay tribute to my Conservative opponent, George Grant, and the noble Baroness Warsi for issuing statements of support during this vicious campaign, and indeed to the Southall Black Sisters and the Muslim Women&#8217;s Network UK, who also issued public statements of condemnation. I would be doing an injustice to the victims of forced marriage and the agenda of violence against women if I did not mention that questioning whether a marriage is forced if a</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/8">parent is present, and asking why victims do not seek support, flies in the face of years of campaigning and hard work, undermining the work of our very own forced marriage unit. A forced marriage, with or without parents and families present and regardless of age, is a forced marriage. &#8220;Being irresponsible with his rhetoric&#8221; is an understatement.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/9">If I had the opportunity, I would talk at great length about the fantastic history and heritage of my constituency and the wonderful contributions made by my other predecessors, most notably the late Marsha Singh, who is remembered fondly both here and at home. The constituency is a rich tapestry of multicultural heritage. It is the birthplace of not just the Bronte sisters but the Labour party itself, which I now proudly represent. It is a welcoming city and it is the curry capital of the country, firmly situated in the north&#8212;the north that the Government continue to fail.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/10">I chose to make my maiden speech in a debate about child tax credit because the issue will have an impact on real families in my constituency. Child poverty is not just an abstract notion in respect of which statistics over-represent the true figures; it is a reality. Some schools in Bradford serve lunch at 11 am because they know that it may be the first meal of the day for many children.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/11">As others have pointed out today, many of those who face the worst cuts are people in work. In an ideal world, work would pay fair wages that allowed people enough money on which to live and support their families, but in many parts of the country that is simply not the case. I represent a place that is about to become the youngest city in Europe, where young people are driven to succeed, but lack the opportunities that would enable them to do so. It is a place where the average full-time weekly wage is almost the lowest in the country, and it is a place that the last Government failed to support. Its council faces swingeing cuts in services that are vital to people in my constituency. It has a university whose fees have increased, and a college whose higher education funding is under attack. Not one but three hospitals provide varied and vital care in an NHS that is struggling.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/12">That brings me to the issue of benefits. For me, the question should never be &#8220;Do we help people who are struggling, or blame them?&#8221; Do we blame those people for an economy that does not work for them, or for an education system that is failing our children? Do we punish them by taking away the small amount of money that we deem to be everyone&#8217;s entitlement? That is our safety net&#8212;and I say &#8220;our&#8221; because we should own it. We should be proud that, since the introduction of a welfare state, this country has striven to stop our citizens from going hungry and our children from living in poverty. During my election campaign I visited the Bradford metropolitan food bank, whose output increased from a few hundred bags a year to thousands.</p>
	<p pid="b.265.0/13">There are challenging times ahead. I have never shied away from a challenge, and nowhere will this challenge be felt more than in constituencies such as Bradford West.</p>

	<p pid="b.266.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25385" name="Naseem Shah">the hon. Member for Bradford West (Naz Shah)</phrase> on an excellent maiden speech, on an excellent</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/2">election victory, and on the many excellent curry establishments in her constituency, which I have visited on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/3">Let me start by drawing the House&#8217;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests. I have been an employer for more than two decades.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/4">This is a debate about dependency: the dependency of the worker. I cannot believe that any workers make their career choices thinking that they will bring up a family and will have to rely on state aid in order to do so; nor am I aware of any business people who embark on their business plan thinking that the state will subsidise their businesses. That, however, is exactly the situation in which we find ourselves. Subsidies are anathema to business people. They suppress innovation and deter investment. Someone earning &#163;10,000 a year who has three children can receive as much as &#163;12,000 in in-work benefits. That is not a sustainable position. The total benefit bill for working tax credit and child tax credit is &#163;30 billion. We frequently talk about productivity in this House. To engender real productivity in our economy we need business people to invest, and not just in the cheapest labour.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/5">The system is very complex. Adam Smith said that the first rule of the tax system is that it must be simple. This revolving door of people paying tax then collecting it back through tax benefits cannot be right. All of us in this House are charged with the responsibility of cutting the cost of government and the cost of this system of tax credit, which must cost hundreds of millions of pounds every year.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/6">The tax credit changes under the last Government were, according to the House of Commons Library, focused on supporting those on the lowest incomes. The 2012 Resolution Foundation report said that tax credits have a negative impact on work incentives and in turn on productivity. That cannot be right. We need people to climb the ladder of success, not stand in the queue.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/7">We need simplicity in order to deliver incentives to work. Universal credit has been introduced to do that. It also makes sure there is transitional protection so that nobody is worse off. I believe that we need to change the tax credit system to make work pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/8">Work is paying for more people, however. There are 600,000 more people in work than there were in 2010, and 40,000 households who had never worked are now working. Can there be a finer example to the children in those households than to see somebody getting up and going to work? These are all parts of the change to the system that we need to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/9">We need to make work pay by getting the employer to make work pay. The minimum wage is too low and we should move over time towards a living wage. We have a strong economy, and in a strong economy everybody deserves a decent standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="b.266.0/10">We should reform the tax credit system, and ideally lose the tax credit system if everybody in work is earning a decent amount of money. We need to make these changes progressively and over time.</p>

	<p pid="b.268.0/1">Under the universal credit system there is transitional protection so no one is worse off, and I absolutely believe in that. If we increase the minimum wage by 5% a year, over 10 years it would reach the then current level of the living wage. This needs to be done sensitively&#8212;sensitively for business, as we do not want it to cost jobs. It therefore needs to be done progressively. I absolutely believe we need to reform the system, and that should be reflected in what employers pay, so that there is something in it for them.</p>

	<p pid="b.268.1/1">Let me begin, Mr Deputy Speaker, by thanking you and the House for the honour you do me by listening to my maiden speech today.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/2">As MP for Blackburn, I follow in the footsteps of illustrious predecessors. After the war, a formidable woman, Barbara Castle, represented my constituency until 1979. When Barbara Castle made her maiden speech 70 years ago, she made a promise that in her career in this House she would be the &#8220;pineapple of politeness&#8221;, an aspiration I will seek to emulate&#8212;but with no guarantees.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/3">Barbara was known as a fighter. She fought for fairness and equality, and she was unquestionably the most successful female politician of her generation. Barbara was somebody with immense personal and political courage. She was able to inspire others and is still remembered very fondly in Blackburn today. She campaigned tirelessly to secure pensions and benefits, particularly child benefits. She would rightly be appalled and angry at this Government&#8217;s welfare reforms. She would be outraged at the glib statements Ministers make when speaking about poverty and deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/4">My immediate predecessor, Jack Straw, will be familiar to this House, where his parliamentary career included holding, with distinction, a number of high offices, including Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Lord Chancellor and Leader of the House. But in Blackburn we remember a very different Jack; we remember an extremely hard-working Member of Parliament who served our town for over 36 years. Whether it was when on his soapbox&#8212;again, I cannot guarantee to copy that; stiletto heels will go through the box&#8212;or in his walk-in surgeries, he always made time for his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/5">I am therefore really pleased that, despite standing down as MP, Jack&#8217;s connections with Blackburn are due to continue. He is to become chair of the fantastic Youth Zone, an initiative that was led by local business. It is a great example of collaboration between the private, voluntary and public sectors. It gives young people tremendous facilities to develop as individuals and engage in positive activities right next to the new Cathedral Quarter. Jack will also continue to be a governor at Blackburn&#8217;s University Centre, another facility that is testament to his energy and commitment to bring the best to Blackburn. I am under no illusion that Jack will be a hard act to follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/6">To represent Blackburn, you need to know, understand and love the town. I moved there in 1977 from the west coast of Scotland, working in a shoe factory, where, I am proud to say, I worked full-time and received family</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/7">tax credits. I am also proud to say that my two daughters have always worked and, fortunately, have never been in a position where they have had to claim tax credits. In Blackburn, I learned from the best; the people were warm, welcoming and hard-working, and their passion for the place is infectious. We have a rich and diverse community who are only too pleased to play their part in improving the town, as was vividly demonstrated when thousands of volunteers came out to spring-clean the town to honour Her Majesty the Queen&#8217;s visit on Maundy Thursday last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/8">We have a number of initiatives that bring people together: the Your Call campaign, where residents take responsibility for their own area; the 100 Voices initiative, which brings together people from right across the town to discuss issues; and Just Good Friends, which gets older people out to reminisce, have a dance and help tackle social isolation. The diverse communities of Blackburn are strong, and I am immensely proud they have chosen me to represent them in this place. In Blackburn, there is a strong partnership between residents, the council and local businesses. For example, the local college and the council have just, in partnership, built a new state-of-the-art leisure centre. The private sector has committed to having apprentices from more disadvantaged groups and to fund the youth facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/9">I served as a councillor for 20 years, many of which as leader of the council, and I have seen Blackburn go through good and bad times. In every case, the people of Blackburn pulled together. To know Blackburn and to understand where it is going, we have to understand its history. Blackburn was one of the key mill towns that were the driving force behind the industrial revolution. By the end of the 1840s, there were 75 cotton mills. By 1860, that number had more than doubled.</p>
	<p pid="b.268.1/10">One hundred years earlier, the cotton industry was revolutionised by the invention of the spinning jenny. James Hargreaves patented his invention&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Blackburn led the northern powerhouse more than 100 years ago, and I am sure that it will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.269.3/1">I warmly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25298" name="Kate Hollern">the hon. Member for Blackburn (Kate Hollern)</phrase> on an excellent maiden speech. It is clear that she is deeply rooted in her community, and I have no doubt whatsoever that, when people talk about Members of Parliament for Blackburn, her name will trip off the tongue very naturally behind those of Barbara Castle and Jack Straw, and that she will be a distinguished successor to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.3/2">This debate has been based on a great deal on speculation about what may be in tomorrow&#8217;s Budget. Before turning to the specific topic of tax credits, perhaps I should focus briefly on some facts. I am talking about the performance of the coalition Government over the past</p>
	<p pid="b.269.3/3">five years. If we examine the facts, rather than the speculation, we will see very clearly that the Conservatives in the coalition Government did a good job in standing up for working people and ensuring that work paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.269.3/4">Let us spend a moment rehearsing those facts. During the previous Parliament, 2 million more jobs were created, of which 75% were full time. More jobs were created in this country than in all of the countries in the European Union put together. Indeed, more jobs were created in the county of Yorkshire, in which the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25415" name="Kevin Hollinrake">the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake)</phrase> is located, than in all of France put together. That is a record of which to be proud.</p>

	<p pid="b.270.1/1">Unfortunately, I do not have that figure at my fingertips. What I do know is that, thanks to the tax cut for people on low incomes, &#163;800 a year was put directly into their pockets. One Opposition Member made the point that many people on tax credits do not pay income tax. Well, that is precisely because the coalition Government raised the income tax threshold so high.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.1/2">We have also heard a great deal about the cost of living, to which <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25313" name="Anna Turley">the hon. Member for Redcar (Anna Turley)</phrase> alluded a moment ago. The fact is that wages in this country are now growing at around 3% a year, at a time when inflation is at zero. Yes, it did take time to get there, but that was because it took some time to fix the mess that had been left behind for us. The cost of living problem to which the hon. Lady referred is being alleviated with every month that passes, and that trend will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.1/3">I also welcome the planned increase in the minimum wage from &#163;6.50 an hour to &#163;6.70. That is the first real-term increase since 2008, and it will help. When we pause and consider the facts rather than the speculation, we will see that the record of the coalition Government was extremely strong in helping people on low incomes. Speaking of poverty, there are now 800,000 fewer people and 300,000 fewer children in relative poverty than there were five years ago, and that is fantastic progress. Those are the facts, so let us now consider the topic before us&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> They are the facts.</p>

	<p pid="b.270.4/1">I look forward to hearing the point after the debate, perhaps.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.4/2">Let me turn now to the topic before us. When Gordon Brown introduced these measures in the early 2000s, he told us that tax credits would cost perhaps a</p>
	<p pid="b.270.4/3">couple of billion pounds a year. The truth is that today they cost &#163;30 billion a year, an astronomic burden on the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.4/4">Let us think for a moment about what tax credits mean. They are a subsidy paid to top up wages because employers are not paying their staff properly. I deplore the fact that some employers are not paying their staff properly and are effectively abusing the generosity of the Government by underpaying their staff. Any reforms in tomorrow&#8217;s Budget that end that abuse will be extremely welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.270.4/5">Tax credits provide disincentives to work, as some of my colleagues have pointed out already. They are withdrawn at the same time as income tax and national insurance kick in. Effectively we have marginal tax rates at around the 75% to 80% mark, so it is no surprise that employees in the companies run by my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton were reluctant to take pay rises when marginal tax rates were so high. One Member mentioned the 16-hour-a-week limit, now raised to 24 hours a week. I know people who have employed part-time staff who refused, understandably given the system, to work extra hours for fear of losing those extra tax credits. That is all wrong. The fundamental fact is that people are helped out of poverty not through Government handouts but through hard work and earning more money.</p>

	<p pid="b.271.0/1">The hon. Gentleman was asked about food banks in Yorkshire and we have heard a lot about facts, so perhaps I can give him a fact. Between the end of 2012 and September 2014, nearly 150,000 sanctions were applied in Scotland, affecting 85,000 individuals. That is what is driving people towards food banks. Does he think that that is right?</p>

	<p pid="b.271.1/1">It is right that wages are now rising, that people on low incomes have been helped with tax cuts and that the Government are directing assistance to people on low incomes. That is what is right. Over time, as the cost of living issues that have been mentioned are eroded by rising wages combined with zero inflation, the problem that the hon. Gentleman has referred to will without a doubt be alleviated.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/2">There are other issues with tax credits. Employers who abuse tax credits by underpaying their staff have no incentive to invest in education, training and technology and, unfortunately, that contributes to our productivity problems. I believe that tax credits, introduced by the previous Labour Government, are a symptom of failure. They encourage companies to underpay their staff and place the burden of that underpayment on the general taxpayer. Any move in tomorrow&#8217;s Budget to reduce the burden of tax credits on the Exchequer while improving the earnings power of people on low pay will be very welcome. I join many colleagues on the Government and Opposition Benches in supporting moves towards a higher minimum wage. I have publicly called for that in London and I think that it would be a good move for the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/3">We have heard about another cost of living issue: housing. There will be a housing Bill in the autumn that will promote house building and therefore affordability, but I point out to Opposition Members that the number of housing starts last year was about 50% higher than the number of starts in 2009-10. The Government have already made fantastic progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.271.1/4">The foundations of prosperity and the way out of poverty lie in work, not benefits, and I endorse the Government&#8217;s approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.272.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the light of that, I shall not take any interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/2">I congratulate all the Members who made their maiden speeches this afternoon. They have been fantastic and it is a privilege to follow them.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/3">As lovely a place as Oldham is&#8212;the place where I live and which I represent&#8212;it has a very low-wage economy. One in three of the people who work in Oldham earns less than the living wage. That is significantly above the north-west average and the UK average. Associated with that there are high rates of deprivation and child poverty&#8212; 27% overall, and in some wards it is nearer one in two. We have talked about food bank use: we used not to have a food bank in Oldham, but we have one now. I undertook a fairness commission report to look at the core issues underpinning that and to set out how we could address them. It was not unique; other boroughs and cities have done a similar analysis. One of the key truths, unfortunately, is that the UK is one of the most unequal countries in the world. In its recent report, the International Monetary Fund, which the Minister did not seem to know anything about, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/4">&#8220;Widening income inequality is the defining challenge of our time&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/5">Forty years ago, 5% of income in the UK went to the highest 1% of earners. Today it is 15%. We should spare a thought for our cousins across the water, where the figure is even higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/6">This is the IMF&#8217;s second report. In the light of the work of Joseph Stiglitz and others, it found that inequalities are a drag on growth and can make growth volatile. This supports work by the OECD, which rejected the trickle-down economics so popular with Thatcherites. That idea supposed that increasing wealth at the top would trickle down to the rest of the food chain, and that policies aimed at reducing inequality would remove incentives and slow growth. Now the evidence is clear: inequalities have slowed growth, not increased it. According to this analysis, raising the income share of the poorest 20% of the population increases growth by as much as 0.38% over five years. By contrast, increasing the income share of the richest 20% by 1% decreases it.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/7">We have a weak, stagnant economy, and the measures proposed will only make it worse. As colleagues have mentioned, over the past five years IFS analysis has shown that the bottom 20%&#8212;the people on the lowest income&#8212;have been disproportionately affected by both tax and benefit changes. This is compounded by the cuts to public services, skewing resources away from areas of high need, and by the impact of the disastrous housing policy on housing costs. The Government justify this by saying&#8212;we can hear the mood music&#8212;&#8220;We are far too generous with benefits.&#8221; A comparative analysis</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/8">of benefits spending as a proportion of GDP shows that we are 17th among EU countries. We spent 15% of our GDP on social security. That does not support the claim that we are incredibly generous.</p>
	<p pid="b.272.2/9">One of the other myths that the Government are spreading is that everyone will be fine if they are in work. Again, the evidence does not support that. We have one of the highest under-employment rates in the EU, and about 80% of the increase in employment comes from self-employment. The average income drawn by people who are self-employed is less than &#163;10,000 a year. In Oldham 20,000 working families with nearly 30,000 children are claiming tax credits. That is two in three families and three in four children. For them, tax credits mean the difference between just about keeping their heads above water or not. The Oldham fairness commission that I run has produced strong evidence of the impact of parental income on cognitive development, behaviour and health outcomes, which will have a negative effect on those children&#8217;s life chances&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.273.1/1">I, too, will take no interventions, following that example. I thank those Members who came in earlier, intervened and then walked straight out again, eating into the time available for my speech in the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/2">In opposing the motion, I wish to explore three areas mentioned in&#8212;or, in fact, omitted from&#8212;the proposal. The first relates to in-work tax credits, what they were designed to achieve and what has happened in practice. &#8220;In-work tax credits need substantial reform to end the practice of employers paying low wages which are topped up by the state.&#8221; I was heartened to read that they were the those words of Alistair Darling, who introduced tax credits in the early 2000s. I am a firm believer that it is always wise to listen to those who pioneered a measure, as they are best placed to review whether it is meeting the objective it set out to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/3">I submit that tax credits were not introduced to encourage large and profitable employers to keep wages low and to keep employees on the lowest rung of the ladder or risk losing a taxpayer-funded subsidy. Tax credits were introduced to incentivise employment, but with the view that as the employee showed his or her worth, their pay and prospects would increase and they would move beyond the tax credit threshold. However, I contend that tax credits have instead acted as a drag on real-time pay increases, as to increase pay would mean that the employer no longer received a top-up from the state. As such, they tend to keep employees in part-time work or on lower pay. With hindsight, it might have been better to put a time limit on the payment of tax credits, in the way this Government have done for the two-year national insurance holiday.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/4">The second area relates to whether there is a better model for Government intervention in working pay. The motion talks about a belief</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/5">&#8220;that people should be given support and incentives to find employment and stay in employment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/6">Indeed, with over 2 million new jobs having been created since the Government came to power in 2010, there is compelling evidence that the Government have supported</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/7">people to find work. The motion should talk about the need to incentivise employers and employees to move up through the pay scales, which will boost spending in the economy overall and lead to increased productivity. The Government have provided incentives by reducing the tax rates for 26 million workers. However, while the Government, and therefore the country, find the money to give employees more of their own money through lower taxes, we continue to pay employers for employing staff. It is not as if the Government have increased the tax burden on companies to compensate for the cost of tax credits, because corporation tax has been reduced from 28% in 2010 to 20% in 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/8">Assessing whether it is possible to phase out tax credits, with an expectation that employers will cover the pay differential to staff, will free up more money for essential public services, such as health and education, where funding would be better utilised by us as a whole. Under the alternative&#8212;stepping out of private pay provisions that should be set by employer and employee, and funded by the employer only&#8212;there is a case for the Government sharing the cost of this reduction with employers and employees, with some of the savings being recycled as further corporation tax and income tax reductions.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/9">The third point is more of an omission. It relates to high earners. The motion</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/10">&#8220;urges the Chancellor to guarantee that any assistance in the July 2015 Budget is focused solely on people on middle and low incomes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/11">I fear that is another attempt to try to segregate those on higher incomes from the policies affecting this country. It should be remembered that the top 3,000 earners pay more tax to the Exchequer than the lowest 9 million&#8212;a third of all workers. Many in this House would say that is eminently sensible and just. However, it is crucial for any Government to assess whether the tax rates applicable to higher earners make economic sense for the rest of us, and not merely to play politics by demonising those who do so much to keep our public services funded through their own risk-taking and endeavour. In the last financial year, the wealthiest were funding a greater share of Government spending than at any time in history, notwithstanding the reduction of income tax from 50p to 45p. The wealthy are now largely weaned off the state.</p>
	<p pid="b.273.1/12">In conclusion, the Government have created a remarkable economic climate, with 2 million new jobs and a 40% reduction in out-of-work benefits. The challenge, as we hopefully move to a period of growth and rising pay and incomes, is to set the jobs market free, lift people above the tax credit threshold, and, in so doing, ask employers to contribute the full share of pay.</p>

	<p pid="b.274.0/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech today. Like others before me, I would like to thank the House staff for being incredibly helpful, with a huge thank you to Estelle, who was assigned the onerous task of stopping me getting lost in all the nooks and crannies. She has been an enormous help to me over the past few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/2">I would not be here today were it not for the incredible support from family and friends and activists back home. It was a very much a team effort. As I often said,</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/3">&#8220;This isn&#8217;t about me; it&#8217;s about us.&#8221; I pay tribute to my predecessor, Sandra Osborne, who served the constituency for 18 years. While we had some political differences, there was much we could agree on. I know that Sandra was dedicated to representing the constituency during her time in office. I thank Sandra for her work and commitment over the years and wish her well for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/4">My journey began as a civil servant. During this time, I saw at first hand how people struggled to interact with the benefits system and how successive Governments, of whatever hue, failed to work for the benefit of those less well off. What I have heard in the Chamber today leads me to believe that little has changed for these people&#8212;our constituents&#8212;in the years since I ceased to be a civil servant. It was my experiences in the civil service that led me into the third sector and to give something back to my community, with voluntary roles in education, health, youth work and criminal justice, to name but a few.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/5">Thyroid cancer in 2010 forced me to re-evaluate my life. It reaffirmed my priorities and I realised that some of the small stuff just was not important. I took charge of my own destiny and started my own business. At the same time, no longer being constrained by working in the civil service I became more politically involved and was asked to stand in a local election, where I was successfully elected as a councillor to the Ayr East ward. This allowed me to address some of the barriers and red tape that people had constantly come up against.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/6">I think the community representative is stronger in me than the politician. I am not here for glory or be a media star in this pantomime that is called Government. In no other environment is the behaviour acted out here regarded as acceptable. I am here to represent the people in my constituency, who live lives far removed from this Westminster bubble. I see my role here as to work tirelessly for the people who voted for me, and for those who did not. I want the constituency to thrive and the people who live there to have the opportunity to reach their full potential. It is about having a future you choose rather one that is dictated by circumstances and damaging Government policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/7">My constituency is famous for its rugged coast, challenging hills and walks, its history, and a thriving food and drinks industry, which includes a whisky distillery, a microbrewery, a chocolate factory, and of course the famous Ayrshire tatties. From bordering Dumfries and Galloway in the south, it goes past the fishing town of Girvan, towards the reinvigorated Turnberry golf resort, and up to the ancient place of Maybole, which received a charter from the Earl of Carrick in 1193. Across the water is the tiny island of Ailsa Craig where blue hone granite was quarried to make curling stones. Moving inland towards the east, we have the Doon valley, where there are many sites of scientific interest, including the Dark Sky park. Close by are New Cumnock and Cumnock, where Keir Hardie, the father of the Labour party, spent a large part of his life. He started up the Ayrshire Mining Union and was a journalist on the local paper. He spoke at Cumnock town hall, along with Emmeline Pankhurst. It was clear that she was in the area for a reason, because it is noted that in 1914 two suffragettes tried to bomb Burns Cottage and set fire to Ayr racecourse, causing thousand of pounds-worth of damage.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/8">Fast forward to the present, and there are many beautiful, historic, picturesque villages such as Barr, Dailly, Kirkmichael, Straiton, Dalrymple, Drongan and Coylton, to name but a few. Many of these old mining villages have been left marred by abandoned open-cast mines, and many in the constituency are waiting with bated breath to see if tomorrow&#8217;s Budget is going to address this. The biggest town in the constituency is Ayr&#8212;a university town that hosts campuses for the University of the West of Scotland, Scotland&#8217;s Rural College, and Ayrshire College. It is also home to Ayr United.</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/9">In 1315, this historic burgh saw King Robert the Bruce convene a parliament in St John&#8217;s Tower, which is still there today, to decide the succession to the throne. It is an historic past. Our gory past also includes a ghostly piper at Culzean castle and the burning of Maggie Osborne, the last witch. Our famous baird is Robert Burns, who is celebrated the world over and who said that Ayr had</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/10">&#8220;honest men and bonnie lasses.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/11">And who am I to disagree?</p>
	<p pid="b.274.0/12">It has been 35 years since I first started working with people in need. Let us not make it another 35 years before this House actually does something constructive for our poorest and most vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid="b.276.0/1">First, may I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25401" name="Corri Wilson">the hon. Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Corri Wilson)</phrase> on her excellent maiden speech, which I am sure will be the first of many?</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/2">A lot of my constituents are low-paid workers. Many are paid the minimum wage and some receive even less. They work very long hours and some have two or three jobs to bring in enough money to feed their families and pay the bills. Even then, some of them cannot afford to put food on the table seven days a week and have to endure the humiliation of going to food banks with their families.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/3">These low-paid workers are not shirkers or skivers, lazy or feckless; nor, as a matter of interest, are they the people who caused the financial and banking crisis in 2008. If the curtains on their houses are drawn at 7 or 8 in the morning, it is not because they are skiving or being lazy, but because they only got home from work after midnight. These are the people in my constituency who rely on working tax credits to top up their poverty pay, and it is they who suffer if tax credit support is reduced or abolished.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/4">I agree with the Prime Minister that employers should pay the living wage, but many of them do not and will not unless they are forced to do so. If the Government are serious and want to save money on tax credits, they must turn the statutory minimum wage into a statutory living wage. Indeed, the Prime Minister should understand that argument, because Steve Hilton, who was his adviser until recently, has advocated exactly that. I hope very much indeed that that is what the Government will do. I suspect that they will offer incentives to employers to pay the living wage, but by doing so they would just be subsidising employers&#8212;they would not save money.</p>
	<p pid="b.276.0/5">In a different world we would have unions that were strong enough to bid up their members&#8217; wages, but they are not strong enough. Conservative Members smile and laugh whenever unions are mentioned. Unions have a traditional role of negotiating better terms and conditions for their members. The Conservative party hates trade unions. Indeed, it has made it absolutely plain that it will bring in even more draconian restrictions on them, so trade unions will not be able to do their traditional job of bidding up wages. Therefore, it is down to the Government&#8212;if they are serious&#8212;to turn the minimum wage into a living wage. Is that what Treasury Ministers intend to do?</p>

	<p pid="b.277.1/2">The Government could set an example by insisting that the contractors they use pay the living wage, not the minimum wage. That would be positive. Treasury Ministers could set an even better example. When Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, which is the Treasury&#8217;s responsibility, put out its cleaning contract to ISS and was offered a contract price based on either the minimum wage or the living wage, why did it choose the minimum wage? It could have set an example by choosing the living wage, but it chose the lowest common denominator. Low pay is a national scandal. It is not the fault of hard-working, low-paid families in my constituency or anywhere else in the country. It is the Government&#8217;s responsibility to address this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.4/1">I congratulate everyone who has made their maiden speeches today. They have been wonderful to witness and to listen to.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.4/2">This issue is of particular concern to me. Any cut to tax credits by this Government will hit my constituents in Edmonton especially hard. In my constituency, 18,000 children are in families that receive tax credits. Overall, 72% of families in the area receive tax credits, which is 21% higher than the national average. Those families and children will suffer if tax credits are cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.4/3">The Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that cutting &#163;5 billion from tax credits means that working families will lose an average of &#163;1,400 a year. That is not political scaremongering, but the finding of an independent and highly respected organisation. In my constituency surgeries, I already meet many people who are in work but are struggling to get by. The people of Edmonton simply cannot afford this further reduction in their income.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.4/4">The charity End Child Poverty estimates that 42% of children in Edmonton already live in relative poverty, after housing costs are taken into account. We found out only last week that progress in reducing child poverty has stalled since <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10777" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr Cameron)</phrase> came to power. All the evidence suggests</p>
	<p pid="b.277.4/5">that cutting tax credits will push thousands more families below the poverty line, robbing children in my constituency of the opportunities they all deserve.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.4/6">It should be plain to everybody in the Chamber that cutting tax credits for working families is immoral, but we must also realise that this is a bad approach to bringing down the welfare bill. The main driver of welfare spending during the last Parliament was low pay and the shortage of affordable social housing. Both those problems have got much worse since 2010. The coalition Government&#8217;s attack on working families has meant that the number of people paid less than the living wage has gone up 45% since 2009. That is a particular issue in London, where the minimum wage is already &#163;2.65 an hour lower than the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.277.4/7">If the Government were serious about bringing down the welfare bill, they would take urgent action to move us towards a high-wage economy in which people can afford to live on the wages that are paid. It is clear that cutting tax credits will not help to achieve that. Instead of making further attacks on the low paid, the Government should work to make the minimum wage a genuine living wage, and take much stronger action against companies that flout minimum wage laws. However, this Government have no plans to deal with these issues, but seem determined to push ahead with tax credit cuts that will leave more working families in Edmonton and across the UK in poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.0/1">Thousands of families in my constituency will go to bed tonight with a sense of foreboding. They are waiting for an axe to fall that will take a chunk out of their weekly budget, but they do not know where or when it will fall. I do not expect the Government to spell that out chapter and verse before the emergency Budget tomorrow, but my constituents and people across the country deserve better than the Prime Minister&#8217;s and the Chancellor&#8217;s media-teasing statements about merry-go-rounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/2">Tomorrow, the Chancellor will announce a series of deep cuts to working-age benefits. We know that tax credits will, in one way or another, be reduced significantly. For many of my constituents who are in low-income work, it is tax credits that enable them to go to work in the first place. They cover childcare and transport costs, which low wages alone do not meet. They provide the security that this Government&#8217;s low-pay, low-productivity recovery has not. The irony is that without tax credits, many people would not be able to afford to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/3">This is the heart of the matter: over 60% of the families with children who receive tax credits in my constituency contain someone in work. It is tax credits that make that work pay. A cut to tax credits will put at serious risk the ability of many of my constituents to support themselves. One of my constituents wrote to me just last week with her fears about the cuts. Her family&#8217;s situation sums up the vital role that tax credits play:</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/4">&#8220;My son and his wife are barely surviving with the Tax Credits that they do get. If the Tax Credits get cut, they will end up living in my attic again.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/5">The Government should be ashamed of creating such a situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/6">Tomorrow, the Chancellor will no doubt try to justify his cuts by telling us that tax credits are letting employers off the hook, making it easier for them to pay poor wages and leaving taxpayers to make up the shortfall. I say that he is looking at things the wrong way round. Instead of cutting family incomes and hoping that employers will suddenly step in, he should be asking why those employers are underpaying their staff in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/7">We need a substantially higher minimum wage, and I hope that tomorrow we will see positive action from the Chancellor to get more employers paying the living wage. If he wants to reduce the amount the Treasury spends on tax credits, he should not cut them, which only punishes those on low incomes, but set out a Budget that boosts low incomes, thereby taking people out of a reliance on tax credits and other in-work benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.278.0/8">Given the recent speculation in the media about the possible reduction of child tax credits back to their real-terms 2003-04 level, it is worth looking briefly at the impact that such a change would have. It would affect 3.7 million low-income families, costing them &#163;1,400 per year on average. More than two thirds of those who would be hit would be in work, and almost two thirds would come from the poorest 30% of households. Most shockingly, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that if the cut were introduced, 300,000 children would be pushed into living in poverty.</p>

	<p pid="b.279.0/1">I welcome this important debate, which I am sure, given the volume of correspondence that I and other hon. Members have received on the subject, is being watched closely by a great number of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/2">As other hon. Members have said, we do not know the precise details of what the Chancellor will unveil in his Budget tomorrow, but if the assault on tax credits is anything like what has been trailed in the press over recent days, many thousands of families in my constituency should be bracing themselves this evening for a big hit to their household budgets.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/3">I will briefly examine the implications for my constituents of the potential proposal that has received the most attention over recent days: a reduction in the value of the child element of child tax credit back to its 2003-04 level in real terms. That entitlement is paid to approximately 9,300 families in my constituency and benefits 17,500 children. More than two thirds of those families are in work and the annual value of the child element for each is &#163;2,780. Scaling it back to its 2003-04 level would constitute a reduction in support of 30%, costing those families a staggering &#163;845 a child. A reduction in a family budget of that scale would be deeply damaging. By its very nature, the impact would be felt disproportionately by women, ethnic minorities and single-parent households like the one that I grew up in.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/4">The Chancellor is likely to defend taking the axe to tax credits by pointing to the much-vaunted pledge to lift low-income households out of tax altogether or, in the Prime Minister&#8217;s words, to end the &#8220;merry-go-round&#8221; of people paying tax while receiving state support. They are both tilting at straw men. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24788" name="Shabana Mahmood">the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase></p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/5">mentioned, more than half the families who claim tax credits already pay no tax at all. For those who do pay tax, the likely options of bringing forward a rise in the personal allowance threshold or a rise in the national insurance threshold, while easing the strain, will nowhere near compensate them for the likely scale of reductions in in-work support.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/6">Few, if any, now believe that the growth in tax credit support that occurred over the past 17 years can be repeated, but let us be clear: tax credits are necessary and they will continue to be so, not just to incentivise employment and reduce child poverty, but to address the underlying flaws in a low-pay, low-skill, low-productivity economic model that requires significant amounts of in-work support. For all their flaws, tax credits have provided a lifeline for those on low and middle incomes, and they will still be necessary in some form, even if the UK becomes a living wage economy overnight.</p>
	<p pid="b.279.0/7">Of course we must be open minded about the need to simplify what is a fiendishly complex system, and we should question rigorously the sustainability of the underlying economic model that has made tax credits necessary. While doing so, let us not delude ourselves that another, deeper, round of cuts to tax credits will do anything other than cause untold hardship for thousands of families in my constituency and across the country who rely on state support to make the most of their lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.280.0/1">There are 4,200 working families with children who are claiming tax credits in my constituency. That is 4,200 families with parents who are working hard, doing the right thing, trying to stay off welfare, proud to be in work with the dignity that that brings, and trying desperately hard to get through the month, keep afloat and provide for their families. They rely on tax credits to survive. Tax credits are not a luxury.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/2">Tax credits were introduced by the Labour Government because we cared about in-work poverty. We cared about making work pay, particularly for single parents who were struggling in and out of a working life. That is why we introduced the historic minimum wage&#8212;despite fierce opposition from those on the Conservative Benches&#8212;and why we brought in Sure Start to give kids the best start in life. That is also why we introduced tax credits, which have been a lifeline for so many people and contributed to the huge fall in child poverty on our watch.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/3">Tax credits are vital to help people get through the month. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25379" name="Matthew Pennycook">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook)</phrase> said, we have received a lot of correspondence in the past few days about this issue. Let me quote from one of my constituents who wrote to me this week about her fear of losing tax credits. She stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/4">&#8220;I am literally terrified at the idea of losing my tax credits. I am a 29 year old single mother of an eight-month old baby. I have been in full-time employment since the age of 17 and even worked as a weekend pot washer when I was at school. Both my parents worked and I have been brought up with a good work ethic and to understand the value of money. I am currently on maternity leave but start back at work in a week. However, after 12 years of working full time I am going back part time for two years so I can also focus on the upbringing of my son&#8230;I am anything but a</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/5">&#8216;scrounger&#8217; and have never had to rely on the benefit system, but for the next couple of years tax credits will be essential to help me survive financially. I do not drive a fancy car, I don&#8217;t have Sky\cable TV, I live in a tiny terraced house and I NEVER go on holiday, so I live anything but a luxurious lifestyle that these idiots in power seem to think&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/6">forgive me, Mr Speaker, those are not my words, however much I may agree with the sentiment.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/7">My constituent continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/8">&#8220;I could quite easily go on income support and be a stay at home mum, but I choose to work to distil into my son from a young age that it is important to have a good work ethic (as my parents did with me). I am very good with money but have no idea how I will survive if my tax credits are cut. I have worked for 11 years, paid into the system and for the sake of a couple of years getting something back to help me just make ends meet, I don&#8217;t think this is me being a drain on society or a lazy scrounger the Tories seem to think anyone who claims a penny is. I lay awake at night worrying about all this, the Tories say &#8216;they are the party for working people&#8217; but they make me sick. I have never heard such a bunch of&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/9">I will leave the rest of it there as it is probably not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.280.0/10">Obviously, my constituent does not agree with the hubris and self-congratulation that I have witnessed from those on the Government Benches who seem so delighted with their long-term economic plan, and I will say more about that in debates over the next few days. I would love to say that I am looking forward to the Budget tomorrow, but I am afraid that I will do so with fear and trepidation on behalf of many of my constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-07-07b.281.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25308" speakername="Carolyn Harris" colnum="281"  time="018:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150707/debtext/150707-0004.htm#150707-0004.htm_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.281.0/1">This debate is an important opportunity for Members to express concern and show their support for families on tax credits. Tax credits give families in constituencies right across the UK the choice between eating and heating their homes. Unfortunately, the Government&#8217;s vision of a society in which work pays is skewed by the reality that many working families are living on the breadline. Parents on low wages are dependent on tax credits to raise their income to a level where they can &#8220;get by&#8221;&#8212;not live the highlife, but possibly stop having to use food banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/2">In my constituency of Swansea East, 13,000 children benefit from tax credits. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that any cut to tax credits will push a further 300,000 children into poverty in the United Kingdom. Tax credits provide the vital top-up funds that make a difference for families and allow them a basic standard of living&#8212;a basic right, but not something that Conservative Members are comfortable talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.281.0/3">A shocking indictment of that catastrophic austerity plan is that the people who face the daily hurdles of feeding their kids and keeping them safe and warm are feeling threatened that their safety net is about to be pulled out from under them. The child poverty targets for 2020 will be missed, the number of households below average income shows that no real progress has been made for two years running in tackling child poverty, and charities tell us that child poverty is increasing alarmingly, yet Conservatives think their policies are working. Ahead of tomorrow&#8217;s Budget, I say one thing to the Chancellor: he should think before he speaks. He is putting children&#8217;s lives at risk. Bear that in mind.</p>

	<p pid="b.282.0/1">We have had a good debate. I begin by congratulating my hon. Friends the Members for Bradford West (Naz Shah) and for Blackburn (Kate Hollern), and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25300" name="Patricia Gibson">the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Patricia Gibson)</phrase>, on their excellent maiden speeches and their contrasting reflections on their predecessors. The House looks forward to hearing much more from them in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/2">The Minister said at the beginning that he wants the Government to be a Government for working people. That is a laudable ambition, but they are failing. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25369" name="Harry Harpham">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Harry Harpham)</phrase> is right that working people feel uncertainty and insecurity. Working families are deeply worried about what the Government have in store. They have suffered a long squeeze on their incomes, and they are worried about a fragile recovery and what the future holds for their grandchildren and children.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/3">Their insecurity has been heightened by the prospect of deep cuts to the tax credits that they rely on, and which it appears the Chancellor will announce in the Budget tomorrow. Working families will pay the price for the decision of the Prime Minister and his Chancellor to promise big reductions in social security spending before the election without having worked out a plan to deliver them. The announcements tomorrow will not be about making work pay&#8212;in this instance, that is baloney&#8212;but about making working families pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/4">The Opposition welcome new concern from Conservative Members about low pay&#8212;we have heard a good deal in the debate about the living wage and the need for more secure, high-skilled and high-productivity jobs to support that. We all want a higher-productivity, higher-wage economy, but that requires a change of direction in the management of the economy. For example, it would mean delivering infrastructure, not just second or third announcements of future projects, or announcing and then cancelling them, as has happened in the past couple of weeks. It would mean high-quality training and apprenticeships for young people, not just rehashing old courses.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/5">What the Chancellor must not do&#8212;it appears that this is exactly what he plans to do&#8212;is make working families much worse off by cutting their tax credits long before any increase in their pay. In millions of working families, people work hard but rely on tax credits for the family budget, as was acknowledged by Conservative as well as Opposition Members. It is high time to tackle low pay, but the Government should not attack the low paid, which is exactly what cutting tax credits will do. It will be an attack on working families on low and median incomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/6">It would be fantasy to claim&#8212;I am glad nobody did so in the debate&#8212;that cutting tax credits will in itself lead to higher pay. Research has shown that the introduction of tax credits did not push pay down, and the drastic cuts now envisaged will not push pay up. Raising the personal tax allowance is not the answer&#8212;60% of tax credit claimants earn too little to pay income tax. Only about 1% of the cost of the planned personal allowance rises will actually be spent on lifting lower earners out of tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/7">Tax credits recognise the needs of children in a household in a way that wages never can. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" name="James Cartlidge">The hon. Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge)</phrase> suggested that tax credits</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/8">provided a ceiling on earnings. That is completely untrue. That is not how the system works at all. In fact, tax credits have been by far the most effective move we have ever made in Britain to make work pay. They were introduced by the Labour Government alongside the boost to pay of the national minimum wage, improved and expanded childcare with Sure Start, and groundbreaking welfare-to-work support with the new deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/9">The combination was a huge success, boosting employment by making work pay, supporting the incomes of large numbers of working families, and reducing child poverty in large part by making it worth the while of many more lone parents to be in work. The lone parent employment rate was less than 45% in 1997. Today, it is nearly 65%. Researchers have shown that that transformation was largely thanks to tax credits. The benefits have gone much wider. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24788" name="Shabana Mahmood">the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> opened the debate. In an excellent speech, she drew attention to what the <i>Financial Times</i> said recently, which is that the system of financial support we have in Britain for low-income working families is a key reason for our high rate of employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/10">The flagship reform of this Government, universal credit, aims to build on the success of tax credits. We have always supported the principle of universal credit and we still want it to succeed. It is a good idea. The Government, however, have utterly failed to deliver it. Five years after it was announced, less than 1% of claimants are receiving it and 99% are still on the old benefits. In 2011, we were told it would take six years to deliver universal credit. Today, we are told it will take another six years. Now, before it has even properly begun, the Chancellor wants to make drastic cuts in support for working families that would hole universal credit below the waterline.</p>
	<p pid="b.282.0/11">Will the Minister tell us whether he understands the crucial difference between reforming welfare and labour markets to get people into work and make work pay, and taking an axe to social security and to employment support? These cuts will store up far greater costs if they send into reverse the progress of decades in raising employment rates and reducing child poverty. We will welcome any credible plans to tackle low pay. We have championed the living wage. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25365" name="Kate Osamor">the Member for Edmonton (Kate Osamor)</phrase> pointed out, the coalition Government presided over a 45% rise in the number of people paid less than the living wage,</p>

	<p pid="b.283.1/1">If he had been present during the debate, the hon. Gentleman would have heard a lot of agreement on raising levels of pay being a good thing. That is the right way to reduce the cost of tax credits; not taking an axe to them now in the hope that pay will go up at some point in the future. Calculation of the living wage assumes that families receive tax credits.</p>

We need to give the Low Pay Commission the remit and the powers to tackle low pay across the country, as proposed in the report by Alan Buckle, the former deputy chair of KPMG. We need economic and industrial policies to support more high-skill, high-productivity jobs created by innovative competitive businesses of the future. Belated conversion to the cause of tackling low pay must not be an excuse for Ministers cutting away the vital support on which so many working families rely. As my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10260" name="Harriet Harman">the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase> pointed out to the Prime Minister two weeks ago, not a single family will be helped into work and not a single worker will see their earnings rise simply as a result of cutting tax credits. Ministers should be tackling low pay, but they must not attack the low paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.283.1/4">The Government promised to eradicate the deficit in one Parliament and failed completely to do so, but working families must not be made to pay the price for that failure. Can the Minister assure us that any action taken to tackle low pay or in other ways to support the finances of working families will make up for the losses arising from tax credit cuts? I fear he cannot. He will not be forgiven for a shabby raid on the incomes and security of working families simply to get the Prime Minister and the Chancellor out of a hole. I hope that Members on both sides of the House will join us in supporting this important motion tonight.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-07-07b.284.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24782" speakername="Damian Hinds" speakeroffice="The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="284"  time="018:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150707/debtext/150707-0004.htm#150707-0004.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.284.0/1">The Government&#8217;s clear mission is to support working people as they strive to build security and achieve their ambitions throughout their lives. We know that most people want to do their best to provide for themselves and their families; that education and skills are the bedrock of success and security; that productive employment is the only sustainable way of delivering them; that the state should incentivise independence and self-reliance; and that when someone is working, they should keep more of what they have earned.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/2">We need to make welfare savings so that we do not have to ask other working families to pay more, but when people need support, of course it is right that we support them. These are the principles that have underpinned our welfare and employment policies: making work pay; creating jobs and apprenticeships; improving childcare, education and training; cutting taxes, especially for the lowest paid; and, for those who need extra support, making the benefits system simpler and fairer for them and other taxpayers. On all these fronts, we have achieved a great deal, and we have done it at the same time as cutting the deficit and restoring growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/3">Before responding to some of the points made during the debate, I want to make one thing clear. We have set out our commitment to reducing the deficit, which, among other things, requires &#163;12 billion of savings to be</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/4">realised on welfare, on top of the &#163;21 billion we saved in the last Parliament. Further details, of course, will come from my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in tomorrow&#8217;s Budget, and clearly I am not going to pre-empt any of that this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/5">We have had a very good debate today. In particular, we have heard three distinguished maiden speeches. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25385" name="Naseem Shah">The hon. Member for Bradford West (Naz Shah)</phrase> spoke of the sartorial act she had to follow, and she united the House&#8212;a rare occurrence&#8212;in sharing her pleasure at giving her predecessor a little more time to work on his wardrobe. She was also very generous about her Conservative opponent and the positive role he played in that difficult campaign. That was very much appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25298" name="Kate Hollern">The hon. Member for Blackburn (Kate Hollern)</phrase> spoke about her ambition to be the pinnacle, or indeed the pineapple, of politeness&#8212;a reputation she brings with her from her leadership of Blackburn with Darwen Council&#8212;and reminded us of the long historical roots of the northern powerhouse. She also reminded us of our schools days with her comments about Hargreaves and the spinning jenny. She, too, has a hard act to follow, in the shape of Jack Straw and Barbara Castle&#8212;two great parliamentarians.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25401" name="Corri Wilson">The hon. Member for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Corri Wilson)</phrase> spoke about maintaining a sense of perspective. She also spoke movingly about her battle with serious illness and about how that helped her get perspective on what was most important in life. In reminiscing about the election, she also reminded us that, in our work in the House, it is not about &#8220;me&#8221;; it is about &#8220;us&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/8">There were some other excellent speeches. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25426" name="Huw Merriman">the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Huw Merriman)</phrase> advised that we should always listen to the originator of a policy and what they intended. I am sure that in this case the originator did not intend, and never expected, that the total cost of tax credits would eventually top &#163;30 billion. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25388" name="Julian Knight">the Member for Solihull (Julian Knight)</phrase> talked about the uneven generosity of the Labour party in reaching that figure and about the particular increases just before 2005 and 2010. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" name="James Cartlidge">the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge)</phrase> spoke about the jagged edges in the welfare system that universal credit&#8212;that great reform&#8212;is set to smooth out.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25415" name="Kevin Hollinrake">the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake)</phrase> spoke about the importance of productivity, which is what underpins real-wage growth and is an absolute focus for this Government. We shall hear more about the productivity plan very soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/10">Today&#8217;s debate occasionally strayed into realms of speculation about what may come in the days to follow, but in a powerful speech, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25377" name="Chris Philp">the Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp)</phrase> reminded us to focus on the facts. Some of those facts include this Government&#8217;s strong record on reducing income tax, which has already seen a typical basic rate taxpayer benefit to the tune of &#163;825 since 2010, with that figure set to rise to &#163;905.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/11">Responding to some points raised by Opposition Members, I first remind them that the number of children in workless households is at a record low, which is something we should all celebrate. I say to the Father of</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/12">the House, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10327" name="Gerald Kaufman">the right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, that according to the most recent statistics, the number of children in low-income households in Manchester has fallen.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/13">In contrast to what <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25034" name="Debbie Abrahams">the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams)</phrase> said about the quality of the enormous 2 million jobs created since 2010, there has been a 1.5 million increase in the number of people in full-time employment and a 1.27 million increase in the number of people in high-skilled employment. I remind the various hon. Members who spoke about zero-hours contracts that they account for something in the region of 2.5% of the total jobs in this country, delivering an average of 25 hours&#8217; work a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/14">Even the Labour party nominally agrees that tens of billions of fiscal consolidation will be necessary over the course of this Parliament. I have to remind Opposition Members that the Charter for Budget Responsibility was passed by 505 votes to 18, and we will have to continue the journey towards balancing the budget. I hope that that is a journey we will be able to go on together.</p>
	<p pid="b.284.0/15">In 2010, spending on tax credits had spiralled out of control, with nine in 10 families with children eligible for tax credits. We were taking money away from people in the form of income tax and then giving it back to them through another route. That is why we reformed the system to target support at those who needed it most&#8212;for example, by increasing the disability element while lowering overall Government spending.</p>

	<p pid="b.286.1/1">I am sorry, but I am too short of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.1/2">In the longer term, we will be migrating tax credits into the new system of universal credit, which will improve incentives to work, reduce reliance on benefits, make households better off and increase the number of people in work.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.1/3">There are three key ways to help people to build success and security for themselves and their families: make sure everyone can get a good start in life; create the strong economy that sustains quality jobs; and let people keep as much as possible of what they have earned. We have been doing all three. We have increased our support on childcare and early years education by &#163;1 billion; radically extended childcare provision; and increased funding for the most disadvantaged children in our schools and nurseries. We have created record job growth of 2 million&#8212;more than the rest of the EU put together&#8212;moved more and more households out of unemployment and supported millions of new apprenticeships. We have lowered income tax for 27 million people, including moving the lowest-paid 3 million out of tax altogether, and for the next five years, there will be no increases to income tax, VAT or national insurance contributions. These are the policies that our working people deserve&#8212;the ones they expect and have recently voted for.</p>
	<p pid="b.286.1/4">The only sustainable way to raise living standards is to keep working through the Government&#8217;s long-term economic plan to build a resilient and dynamic economy. Just last week, we learned that living standards had risen again by 3.9% against the same period last year&#8212;further proof of how our long-term plan is helping</p>
	<p pid="b.286.1/5">hard-working families. We have reversed the system inherited from Labour, where it could be more rewarding to live off benefits than to get a job. We have cut income tax for 27 million people. We have capped benefits in a fair way and increased support for those who need it most. We have simplified the benefits system, cracked down on those who abuse it, and helped to provide millions of jobs to empower people to help them get on in life. This Government have continuously stood up for both the vulnerable and the hard working in our society, and we will continue that support every step of the way.</p>

	<p pid="b.293.2/1">I am grateful to have secured the Adjournment debate this evening. It is on the important and sensitive subject of unseen disabilities. May I make this speech in the memory of my schoolboy friend, James Adams, who was killed 10 years ago at Russell Square in the 7/7 bombings? James had an unseen disability, which was the disability of a stammer. He had a deep interest in the workings of this House. Although he took a different political position from me, he would have taken an interest in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/2">Let me highlight the great progress that we have made on how we treat people with seen disabilities. It is perhaps best illustrated by the success of the 2012 Paralympics. But even here, we still have a long way to go. On celebrating his 50th year as a fellow at the University of Cambridge, Professor Stephen Hawking felt compelled to comment:</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/3">&#8220;I wonder whether a young ambitious academic, with my kind of severe condition now, would find the same generosity and support in much of higher education.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/4">Professor Hawking was speaking about seen disabilities. The issue I wish to raise today is specifically regarding the treatment of young people with unseen disabilities and the stigma associated with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/5">It is now 70 years since Asperger&#8217;s syndrome was discovered, 12 years since the publication of the novel &#8220;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time&#8221; by Mark Haddon drastically improved public understanding of the condition, and three years since that play came to the London stage. Yet little progress has been made on how we treat vulnerable people, particularly vulnerable young people with unseen disabilities such as Asperger&#8217;s syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/6">Let me talk about a talented and remarkable young man from my constituency with hidden disabilities who was accepted to study at Cambridge, starting in the autumn of 2012. Azhir Mahmood had a long journey from the noise and bustle of Tottenham to the hushed quadrangles of Cambridge. It started with Azhir teaching himself his maths A-level in his bedroom at home aged only 14, while studying for his GCSEs at the local comprehensive, Gladesmore School. A gifted student, Azhir nervously opened his results letter a couple of years later at a local state sixth form college, Woodhouse, to see that he had got the straight As&#8212;an A* and 2 As&#8212;that he needed to go to Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/7">Growing up in Tottenham, Azhir had not known much about the University of Cambridge, aside from its reputation as a school of international distinction. He was unaware that Cambridge has a college system, which means that most teaching, accommodation and socialising takes place within each college. He did not know which colleges had the best facilities, which were arty or which were science-focused. He certainly did not know which societies and activities he might get involved with once he arrived. Azhir did not even really know how far away his college was from the centre of town. In fact, all he really had to go on when he applied was a</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/8">bewildering patchwork of college websites that all looked remarkably similar, with shiny pictures of fairytale buildings, green fields and wooded grounds. Through a random selection, Azhir picked Homerton College simply because he thought that it looked like a nice place to study.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/9">Azhir had worked hard. That was how he won his place at Cambridge. He had even become a bit of a hero to everyone back home in Tottenham in doing so. It was a source of huge pride in our community that one of our boys was going to study at Cambridge. All that hard work had paid off. He had finally made it. He was there, or so he thought.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/10">Soon after starting at Cambridge, Azhir began to feel isolated at Homerton, which has a preponderance of arts and education students. He felt slightly out of place. He did not know whether it was because of his accent, or how he dressed, or because he was from Tottenham, but living four or five miles away from the centre of Cambridge, where most of his science friends were living, he began to feel utterly alone. His anxiety increased and began to affect the</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/11">&#8220;flashes of genius and brilliance&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/12">his director of studies could see.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/13">Homerton College seemed unable to support him through this increasingly difficult time as the severity of his panic attacks and anxiety disorder increased. Five months in, feeling utterly isolated and defeated, Azhir was forced to return home to Tottenham, which is known in Cambridge as &#8220;intermitting&#8221;, without even sitting his first exams.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/14">While he was intermitting, Azhir was diagnosed with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. The following October he returned to Homerton College and was hopeful that, after his struggles, his college would understand the importance of having his needs assessed. He hoped that proper support would be put in place to assist him with his hidden disabilities and to help him feel less anxious and less alone but again, despite many efforts on his part, no successful measures were put in place by Homerton College to help him cope. He was told to get a bike to cycle into town to see his friends, even though his GP said he had</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/15">&#8220;already had three cycle accidents so I think it&#8217;s safe to say this mode of transport is not for him&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/16">Azhir tells me that by March 2014 he was forced to intermit for the second year in a row. Time passed and by November 2014 Azhir was still stuck in Tottenham. Having been home for eight months, he was desperate to change college within the university. He knew that other students had done it but despite all his emails and phone calls nothing happened. His senior tutor at Homerton had promised the previous July that, if he went home to Tottenham a second time, she would be able to make inquiries to other colleges within the university. Four more months passed by and Azhir was only too aware that current year 13 students&#8217; applications were being considered. Time was running out, yet Homerton staff had not approached even one of Cambridge&#8217;s other 29 colleges.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/17">Meanwhile, a friend of Azhir&#8217;s, a student representative, had been trying to arrange a meeting with his senior tutor for months. When the meeting finally took place Azhir was not even allowed to attend. His friend, advocating on his behalf,</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/18">&#8220;got the vibe they didn&#8217;t really want him to return at all&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/19">Azhir reread his senior tutor&#8217;s letter of <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-20">20 March 2014</phrase> and its list of demands, including her order that he must</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/20">&#8220;focus on recovery from the depression&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/21">suggesting that he do so by booking himself a room at Cambridge&#8217;s YMCA as opposed to remaining on university property, and</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/22">&#8220;developing skills to live as an independent adult&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/23">before he would be allowed to return to his lectures, which he loved. His tutor&#8217;s final paragraph, which said</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/24">&#8220;it may be in your best interests to move to a different university&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/25">kept repeating in his head. Azhir&#8217;s dreams of going into research and of doing something meaningful and worth while seemed to him to have gone. But Azhir&#8217;s medical reports from his psychiatrist and GP stated that, if Azhir could transfer to a central college, close to the science society he liked to take part in, and close to his friends and lectures, he would not be socially isolated. He would then be far less likely to suffer anxiety and depression. He would be better able to concentrate on his studies. His supervisor, Louis Kovalevsky, was able to observe:</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/26">&#8220;Azhir is probably one of the brightest students I met.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/27">So why cannot Cambridge, one of the world&#8217;s oldest and wealthiest universities, which receives at least &#163;260 million of taxpayer funding each year in addition to fees from students and generous bequests, meet Azhir&#8217;s disability needs and facilitate a change of college?</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/28">In an email dated <phrase class="date" code="2015-11-21">21 November</phrase>, his tutor said that the college had to</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/29">&#8220;weigh up our considerable sympathy for Azhir&#8217;s predicament with the necessity to protect other students.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/30">Azhir has never put any other student at risk, let alone caused them harm. Why then, in approaches to other colleges, has Azhir repeatedly been told that each college has to &#8220;prioritise their other students&#8221;, seemingly because of Azhir&#8217;s depression? Do they think that depression is somehow catching?</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/31">If we are serious about encouraging the brightest and the best from all different backgrounds to attend our top universities, Azhir is exactly the sort of devoted and dedicated student that his university should be encouraging and supporting. He has been told to</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/32">&#8220;look at other alternatives where he would be under less pressure&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/33">outside Cambridge. He has also been told that he lacks</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/34">&#8220;a compelling reason why a change of college&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/35">would solve his problems. Worse still, reference has been made to</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/36">&#8220;the necessity to protect our other students, themselves going through very challenging and stressful times in their lives&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/37">I was the Minister responsible for higher education when the Equality Act 2010 was passed in Parliament. The Act defines disability as</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/38">&#8220;a physical or mental impairment,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/39">which</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/40">&#8220;has a substantial and long-term adverse effect&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/41">on a person&#8217;s ability</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/42">&#8220;to carry out normal day-to-day activities.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/43">Under the Act, parity of esteem is given to physical or visible conditions and unseen disabilities, such as the Asperger&#8217;s syndrome and depression from which Azhir suffers. The Act states that disabled students should not</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/44">be treated less favourably than other students. It places a duty on higher educational institutions to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that, in accessing higher education, students who are disabled are not put at substantial disadvantage compared to those who are not disabled</p>
	<p pid="b.293.2/45">Section 149 of the Equality Act contains the public sector equality duty, which requires public bodies to comply with a general duty to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity, and foster good relationships between people who share a protected characteristic and those who do not share that characteristic. Does the Minister think these stipulations have been met in the case of Azhir?</p>

	<p pid="b.296.0/1">I commend my right hon. Friend for bringing this important debate to the House. He has made a number of serious points and anyone listening to his account of his constituent would have huge sympathy. Does my right hon. Friend agree that part of the issue here is the problem of a collegiate university? Often, we talk about the university, but those responsible are in fact the individual colleges. Perhaps the relationship between the two is at the heart of the problem. The university itself has a rather good record of trying to deal with some of these issues and has been singled out for the work that it has done.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-07-07b.296.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10678" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="296"  time="019:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150707/debtext/150707-0004.htm#150707-0004.htm_spnew14">
	<p pid="b.296.1/1">The collegiate system is causing a tremendous problem for my constituent. My hon. Friend will understand that we must have a system that bends to the needs of those with disabilities and creates parity with those without disabilities. In this case, it seems that there are huge problems, which I believe this House and the university must seek to overcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/2">Cambridge University does not seem to understand that unseen disabilities must be recognised as just as debilitating as seen disabilities. The 2010 Act makes it clear that students with Asperger&#8217;s, anxiety or depression are just as entitled to additional support as paraplegic or blind students. What is most shocking to me is that when young Azhir asked for help with his mental health, he felt that the problems he was suffering were used as a weapon to attack him. In normal circumstances, colleges are supposed to act as a kind of surrogate family for young people, but instead of being given help, he was told to go to a different university. Despite there being 29 other colleges at Cambridge where he could successfully complete his course and fulfil his potential, to date that has not happened. My constituent is currently sitting at home in Tottenham.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/3">That brings me to my involvement in Azhir&#8217;s case. At the beginning of March this year my office first contacted the vice-chancellor&#8217;s office to try to arrange a call between me and him. My office was told that he would not be able to talk to me about the matter because the independent status of each college as a charitable institution meant that when a transfer was requested it was entirely up to each individual college whether to accept a student.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/4">Nevertheless, after some negotiation Lisa Dery of the university&#8217;s student advice service took my call. Lisa has been trying to assist throughout this complex process, and we agreed that I would be regularly updated. The student advice service also undertook to make efforts to secure Azhir another college through a &#8220;diplomatic, co-operative and professional&#8221; approach. Unfortunately, despite Ms Dery&#8217;s considerable efforts, no place has yet been found.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/5">When my team was informed that there was only a 20% chance of success, I again sought to contact the vice-chancellor. Again I was given the runaround. My letter of <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-27">27 May 2015</phrase> met with this reply:</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/6">&#8220;I would politely point out that my office did not refuse to speak to you&#8230; A clearer statement would be that it was suggested that you write to me in the first instance.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/7">By that point I had of course already written to the vice-chancellor, so I wrote again to express my concerns, in the hope that I could discuss Azhir&#8217;s case with him personally. That was followed by a phone call from my office seeking clarification that the vice-chancellor really did not wish to discuss the matter. I received this response on <phrase class="date" code="2015-06-10">10 June 2015</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/8">&#8220;to confirm, decisions of both admissions and accommodation are matters for the independent Colleges. The Central University has no remit on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/9">The senior tutors of the Colleges are aware of the case and they have been working with the student for some time in order to find a solution. They are aware of your concerns. Please contact the principal of Homerton College&#8230; if you wish to take this matter further&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/10">On receipt of that reply, my office immediately telephoned the office of the principal of Homerton College, Professor Ward, on <phrase class="date" code="2015-06-11">11 June</phrase> to request a call, and then again twice last week and yesterday. Today I received an email from Professor Ward, and I spoke with him this afternoon. He promised today that he will do his utmost to look after Azhir and support him throughout his studies if he returns to Homerton College this year. That is helpful, but given that Azhir&#8217;s psychiatrist&#8217;s report supports the move to a central college, and given that Azhir has felt very isolated and excluded at Homerton twice before, does the Minister believe that would really meet Azhir&#8217;s needs?</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/11">It is clear to me that I have been given the runaround and that until this afternoon the university did not wish to discuss Azhir&#8217;s case with me. It ought to be deeply embarrassed that the apparent lack of a joined-up, inter-college transfer policy is leading to students with hidden disabilities being denied a move to meet their diagnosed needs, even when failure to do so is having an adverse impact on a student&#8217;s studies, health and, ultimately, their future. It seems it would prefer to sweep the issue under the carpet.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/12">I remind that House that, very sadly, in 2010 Ronjoy Sanyal, a 26-year-old student at Cambridge, took his own life. He, too, had complained that he was not best served by the university. He, too, had Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. It is for that reason, and for all the reasons I have indicated, that I have brought the matter to the House today, and I do so with huge regret.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/13">The way I see it, Azhir and surely many other young, gifted but vulnerable students like him have put the work in and overcome many obstacles to win their place at that world-beating, historic institution, yet because of what appears to be a profound misunderstanding of the impact of hidden disabilities, they are being prevented from realising their ambitions and completing their courses. Azhir and many young people like him have shown extraordinary sprit, dedication and determination to succeed against the odds. They are exactly the sort of hard-working, dedicated young people we should be encouraging. I ask the Minister to look</p>
	<p pid="b.296.1/14">carefully at this case, to speak to the university, if he has not already done so, and really to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="b.298.0/1">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10678" name="David Lammy">the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase> has made some very powerful points. I do not think that anyone listening to his account could fail to be moved by it. There are some serious issues to be looked at. As I said in my intervention, this points to the difficult problems in a collegiate-based university system, although there are also strengths. Over the years, I have looked at the college-based system&#8212;I am partly a product of it&#8212;and sometimes asked myself whether it is the most effective way to operate in the modern world. However, the University of Cambridge is one of the most successful universities in the world. There are some real strengths in the college system but also some weaknesses, as my right hon. Friend clearly identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/2">I am sure that people in Cambridge will want to look closely at this, not least because many of those in the university have worked very hard on some of these issues. In fact, when the Quality Assurance Agency looked at the university a few years ago, dealing with students with disabilities was singled out as one of the areas where it did well. Clearly, even getting a good report like that does not mean that the system works in all cases, because it obviously did not work in this case. The University of Cambridge is one of the few higher education institutions that has a person dedicated to Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, and the number of students with Asperger&#8217;s has risen from 27 in 2009 to 135 today. While there are clearly people making an effort in the university, it is obviously not enough, because it has not worked in this case, as sometimes happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.0/3">I thank my right hon. Friend for bringing this matter to the House. As I say, I am sure that people in Cambridge will want to look at it closely. We all want to make sure that we get a successful outcome for his constituent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-07-07b.298.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24895" speakername="Jo Johnson" speakeroffice="The Minister for Universities and Science"  colnum="298"  time="019:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150707/debtext/150707-0004.htm#150707-0004.htm_spmin1">
	<p pid="b.298.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10678" name="David Lammy">the right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase> for the opportunity to debate this important topic. Access to higher education is an issue that he has long championed as a constituency MP and as a former higher education Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/2">I was extremely sorry to hear of the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituent Azhir Mahmood&#8217;s difficulties with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome and the difficulties that have arisen in his dealings with Homerton College in Cambridge. The right hon. Gentleman quoted Professor Stephen Hawking&#8217;s comments about whether anyone with a condition such as his&#8212;motor neurone disease&#8212;would find the same sort of generosity of support available now as he did when he was a younger academic. Let me assure the House that they most certainly should, for we want many more Stephen Hawkings in our universities&#8212;all of them, wherever they are in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/3">The wellbeing of students is rightly of great importance for our higher education institutions, and I know that they take their responsibilities in this area exceptionally seriously. As autonomous bodies independent of the Government, universities have the responsibility to ensure</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/4">the wellbeing of their students. This includes making reasonable adjustments for those with disabilities, seen and unseen, including those on the autism spectrum. That includes those with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. Institutions have clear legal responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 to support such students, and they are best placed to determine the appropriate support and adjustments that they need to provide to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/5">When an individual believes that they have been discriminated against and a dispute arises, there are established procedures in place for raising a formal complaint. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, this is initially through the university&#8217;s internal complaints procedure. If the complaint is unresolved after completing that process, the student can ask the Office of the Independent Adjudicator to explore the complaint, and that office, which was set up as an alternative to the courts and is free to students, can form its own view. Any complaints can also be referred to the Equality and Human Rights Commission. This is an independent body established under the Equality Act 2006 to stop discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity. It is for each institution to ensure that it is complying with the law and meeting its duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/6">Cambridge colleges are independent, and they make their own decisions. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is rightly not able to interfere with the admissions process. Similarly, I cannot comment on individual cases, but I understand, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25386" name="Daniel Zeichner">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner)</phrase> himself made clear, that the University of Cambridge has undertaken considerable work in this area, including a project looking at the support for students with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. I am told that it was one of a very small number of such projects operating across this country&#8217;s higher education landscape. As the hon. Gentleman has said, before the project started in 2009, very few students with Asperger&#8217;s were studying at Cambridge, but today there are approximately five or six times that number. That is a sign of progress and I welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/7">It is also very positive that data from the most recent national student survey in 2014 showed that disabled students at Cambridge were more satisfied than non-disabled students with their period of study at the university. That is satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/8">There are many other examples of the support that universities have in place. Many universities&#8212;almost all of them, I would imagine&#8212;have induction systems to help students understand university life and people to turn to if they are experiencing difficulties. Institutions offer counselling services to students to help with their health and welfare issues, and most also offer personal tutors. I know that universities are mindful of the fact that many of their students, particularly those who have moved far away from home for the first time to study, will be undergoing a significant transition and may need extra help.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/9">The Government also provide extra support for disabled students, on an individual basis, through the disabled students allowance, which can provide support to students with mental health issues, including those with an autism spectrum disorder such as Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. All students applying for the DSA undergo a needs assessment interview to ascertain their specific requirements with regard to their chosen course of study. Support can include items such as specialist equipment&#8212;assistive software, for example&#8212;and funding for a specialist mentor to provide support to a student to address barriers created by a particular impairment.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/10">It is important that all students, from whatever background and whether they have a disability or not, get the support they need to apply to higher education and be successful in their studies. We are making progress in that respect. The proportion of accepted applicants with a declared disability has increased from 6.5% in 2010 to 8.5% in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/11">Good progress is also being made on the entry of students from black and minority ethnic backgrounds to higher education. UCAS reports that the entry rate for English 18-year-olds increased for all ethnic groups in 2014. Since 2010 there has been a 4.5 percentage point increase in the proportion of students from Asian backgrounds, and a 7 percentage point increase in the proportion of students from black backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/12">We are not satisfied with that, however, and we want to build on that progress, so the Prime Minister has set a goal for increasing the number of students from BME backgrounds progressing to higher education by 20% by 2020. He has also set a goal to double the proportion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education by the end of this Parliament compared with 2009 levels. Those are ambitious goals, and rightly so, and for entry in 2015 we have lifted the cap on aspiration, and publicly funded universities can now choose to recruit as many students as have the ability and wish to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/13">In conclusion, the higher education sector has much to be proud of in its work to ensure the wellbeing and mental health of its students and to fulfil its duties under the Equality Act. I expect the sector to continue to meet its obligations in this area and to build and develop the support it provides.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/14">Again, I am extremely sorry to hear of this particular student&#8217;s experience. The right hon. Member for Tottenham has explained in great detail the steps he has taken to support him, and I commend his work on his behalf as a constituency MP. I must stress, however, the need for both the student and the university to continue to work together for a solution that will enable this talented individual to thrive and flourish in higher education.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/15" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.298.1/16" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
