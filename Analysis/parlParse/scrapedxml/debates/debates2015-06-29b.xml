	<p pid="b.1153.9/1">Does my right hon.

	<p pid="b.1154.0/1">I do indeed. My hon. Friend is a pioneer of neighbourhood planning. He worked closely with me when I was last a Minister in the Department to ensure that it was introduced, and it has been a huge success. The first neighbourhood plan was in Thame, in his constituency. More than 1,500 communities are now engaged in the neighbourhood planning process, and 300 neighbourhood plans have been published for consultation. I am delighted that my hon. Friend has accepted my invitation to work with me to see what we can do to speed up the possibilities for other neighbourhoods throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1154.1/1">The Government&#8217;s decision last week to shelve plans for the electrification of the Leeds to Manchester railway line fundamentally undermined the concept of the northern powerhouse. When were DCLG Ministers first informed of the decision, and were they informed before or after the election? What opportunity was given to local authorities such as Kirklees to make recommendations to various Ministers?</p>

	<p pid="b.1154.2/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport made a substantial statement on the matter, and it was clear that he was dissatisfied with the performance of Network Rail in this respect. However, it is worth our reminding ourselves&#8212;and it is important for those in the north to recognise&#8212;that &#163;38 billion is being invested in the transport system, which is the most significant investment since Victorian times. As for electrification, only 10 miles of line were electrified during the 13 years for which the last Government were in office, but we are committed to it.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1154.3/1">The success of city deals so far has been due to the fact that Ministers have avoided over-prescriptive rules, and instead have focused on what each deal can do for each community. May I strongly encourage the Secretary of State to ensure that that flexibility is retained, particularly in smaller towns and counties?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-29b.1154.4" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11884" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="1154"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150629/debtext/150629-0001.htm#150629-0001.htm_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.1154.4/1">I will certainly take that approach. My hon. Friend was a great force in working with the local enterprise partnerships in their early days, and respecting the fact that every place is different. It would be ludicrous to observe those differences and then impose a uniform requirement in all places.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1154.5/1">May I associate myself with the Secretary of State&#8217;s comments about Tunisia?</p>
	<p pid="b.1154.5/2">In all the debates about the northern powerhouse, I am very keen for us not to forget the southern powerhouse. What powers does the Secretary of State expect to devolve from Westminster to cities such as Brighton and Hove?</p>

	<p pid="b.1154.6/1">The hon. Gentleman should be aware of the success of the Brighton city deal, which has been warmly welcomed throughout his area, and which is one of the reasons for the fact that unemployment in his constituency has fallen by 53% since May 2010. That is a powerhouse that is performing.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.0/1">One of the great advantages of my right hon. Friend&#8217;s devolutionist approach is that city deals can capture the variation that occurs in key areas such as the housing market, which will vary from city to city. Will he talk to organisations such as the Royal Town Planning Institute, which is keen to establish what further work can be done to capture the link between devolution and housing delivery?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1155.1/1">I will indeed, and again I pay tribute to the work my hon. Friend did in the Department in inaugurating this transfer of powers. Housing will be of great importance in all the deals we are negotiating and expect to conclude. There is an appetite for that right across the country and I will certainly take the advice of the RTPI.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.4/1">Annual statistics on trends in home ownership are published in the Department&#8217;s English housing survey headline report, and I was pleased that recently it highlighted the fact that the number of first-time buyers is at a seven-year high.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.5/1">Is the Minister aware that the cost of the average house in Enfield has rocketed to over 11 times the average wage in the borough? Home ownership is now at its lowest level in 30 years, and the dream of buying a home is increasingly out of reach. Why are the Government so complacent about declining home ownership and their failure to build?</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.6/1">The hon. Lady should be pleased that we have seen 600 housing starts in her own area over the last year and that, although we inherited from the last Labour Government the lowest level of house building since about 1923, we have seen that level starting to come back thanks to the work this Government have done to deliver the fastest rate of building not just of council homes, but also affordable homes, in about 20 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.8/1">My hon. Friend makes an interesting observation. Of course, home ownership started to fall in 2005, under the last Labour Government. Over the last Parliament, we worked to get the house building sector working again. We have made it clear that we are a party who believe in helping people who work hard and aspire to own their own home, and that is why we will deliver some 200,000 starter homes for first-time buyers over the course of this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.1156.1/1">The hon. Lady may realise that there have been just over 1,000 housing starts in the last year in her area, which is well up on where it was before and, again, builds on the terrible situation we inherited some five years ago. I hope she will join me in thanking this Conservative Government for pledging to deliver affordable homes at the fastest rate in over 20 years and, of course, those 200,000 starter homes for first-time buyers at a 20% discount. Perhaps her party would like to get on board and support that work.</p>

We have seen the increases over the last few years, and the recent figure of some 261,000 homes getting planning approval last year is pretty much a record level, and is a good sign that we have got the market moving in the right direction.

	<p pid="b.1157.5/1">Councils facing the highest demand for services receive substantially more funding, including through the grant formula.

	<p pid="b.1157.6/1">I thank the Minister for his response, but that is simply not the case, is it? Extreme cuts in areas of need have put councils in an impossible situation. Some have found it so hard to protect essential services that they have had to use funding that had originally been allocated for local welfare assistance schemes. That means that, at times, there is nothing left for people who are in desperate need, such as care leavers, those who are homeless and those who are fleeing abuse. Does he really think that it is acceptable for councils to have to make those choices?</p>

	<p pid="b.1157.7/1">The north-east and the north-west still have the highest spending power per household after London. The average spending power per household in the north-east is &#163;2,313, and the figure for the north-west is &#163;2,250. Those figures are both higher than the England&#8212;excluding Greater London Authority&#8212;average of &#163;2,086. Spending power per household in the South Tyneside area will be &#163;2,402 in 2015-16, which is more than the England&#8212;excluding Greater London Authority&#8212;average and also more than the metropolitan area average of &#163;2,226, so I do believe that adequate resources are being provided.</p>

Over the past five years, Newham, which has very high levels of social deprivation, has lost more than &#163;1,000 of funding per household while wealthier Elmbridge in Surrey has had an increase of more than &#163;40 per household.

Local authorities now benefit from nearly &#163;11 billion under business rates retention, with the scheme estimated to deliver a &#163;10 billion boost to national GDP by 2020. By 2015-16, 94% of local authorities will see growth in business rates above their initial projections, which will be worth some &#163;544 million.

As a result, we did not need to reopen the local government finance settlement for councils for 2015-16.

	<p pid="b.1168.0/1">We have to look at the context. The cost of public sector pensions increased by about a third in the 10 years to 2009, and reform was necessary to ensure a fair deal for firefighters and taxpayers alike. Firefighters&#8217; pensions remain generous. A firefighter who earns &#163;29,000 and retires at 60 after a full career will get about &#163;19,000 a year pension, rising to &#163;26,000 with the state pension. It is also worth remembering that the pension age of 60 is the same as it is for the police and, indeed, for the armed forces.</p>

Gentleman is a former shadow housing Minister, and many of his colleagues are having occasion to reflect on Labour&#8217;s failure to offer any substantive policies; he should take his share of the blame. He should be clear from my previous answer that the right-to-buy policy, in relation to council houses, has increased the supply of housing. Whether on increasing housing supply or increasing aspiration, he should get behind our policy. The Bill was in the Queen&#8217;s Speech and it will be introduced very shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169.0/2">The reason the Secretary of State does not know when he is going to bring forward his housing Bill is that the policies were written on the back of a fag packet during the election campaign and were based on forcing councils to sell 15,000 homes a year. Since then, I have asked his Department how many of these homes will become vacant every year, and it said it does not know. How many council homes will he force councils to sell off every year?</p>

	<p pid="b.1169.1/1">I do not smoke, so there is no question of writing on the back of fag packets, but what I do know is that the Opposition policies for which the hon.

Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase>, has said that the Labour party&#8217;s housing policies made his &#8220;heart sink&#8221;, and each member of Labour&#8217;s leadership parade has called attention to the party&#8217;s failure to come up with credible policies. We are very clear that extending the right to buy is a way of achieving people&#8217;s aspirations. I have yet to hear from the hon. Lady whether she agrees with the right to buy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169.2/1">We are in favour of people&#8217;s aspiration to buy their own home, but we are also in favour of policies that add up and stack up. The Tories are just plucking the figures out of thin air. They have no idea how many council homes will be sold. Indeed, the property specialist Savills estimates that the number is closer to 5,000 rather than 15,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.2/2">This is not just about existing council homes, but about homes that councils are building or planning to build. Is the Secretary of State going to force councils to sell brand-new homes even before those who are on the waiting list&#8212;elderly people, families and others&#8212;are able to move into them?</p>

	<p pid="b.1169.3/1">The hon. Lady gives every impression of not being in favour of the right to buy, but she cannot bring herself to say it. I invite her to make her policy clear. Our policy is very clear: on expensive council houses in the top third of the area, it is an efficient use of those assets to sell them in order to be able to allow more homes to be built. That is a very straightforward policy.</p>

I know that the inspectors will look at it and work with the local authority to get it through the process. If a planning application is made, the local authority itself is the body that makes the decision. Should it end up with an inspector, they will look at the process. Obviously, as the local plan goes through the process it gains more weight, which should be taken into account in any decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173.1/1">It is with great sadness that I have to tell the House that we now know of at least 18 British nationals who have been killed, with more injured. The death toll is likely to rise still further. These were innocent British holidaymakers, people who had saved up for a special time away with their friends and family, but who suddenly became the victims of the most brutal terrorist attack against British people for many years. I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the families and friends of all those who have lost loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/2">I know the whole country will want to share in a moment of remembrance. Following the act of remembrance we have just held in this House, we will have a national minute&#8217;s silence on Friday at 12 noon, one week on from the moment of the attack. In due course, in consultation with the families, we will also announce plans for a fitting memorial to the victims of this horrific attack.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/3">This morning, I chaired the fourth daily meeting of the Government&#8217;s emergency Cobra Committee. Let me take the House through three things: first, the latest on what we believe happened in Tunisia, and also in the separate attacks in Kuwait and France; secondly, the immediate steps we have been taking to help the British victims and their families; and thirdly, how we will work with our allies to defeat this evil in our world.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/4">The events of last Friday are horribly familiar to anyone following them in the media. A radicalised university student, armed with a Kalashnikov, began massacring innocent tourists on the beach at Port El Kantaoui. He continued his attack into the Imperial Marhaba hotel and on to the streets, where he was shot dead by Tunisian police. While we believe he was the sole gunman, it is thought that he may have been part of an ISIL-inspired network. The Tunisian security forces are investigating possible accomplices who may have supported this sickening attack.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/5">On the same day in Kuwait, a suicide bomber killed 27 and injured more than 200 in an attack on the Imam Sadiq Mosque near Kuwait City. An ISIL-affiliated group based in Saudi Arabia has claimed it was behind the attack. In Syria, ISIL executed 120 people in their homes in Kobane. In south-eastern France, a man was murdered and two were injured in an explosion. While all these attacks were clearly driven by the same underlying perverted ideology, there is no evidence to date that they were directly co-ordinated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/6">Our first priority has been to help the British victims and their families. This has meant helping on site, assisting the wounded, bringing home those who have lost their lives, ensuring holidaymakers still in Tunisia who want to come home are helped to do so and gathering further evidence of what happened. A team of consular staff were on site in Sousse within hours and, by Saturday, were complemented by additional teams of consular staff, police and Red Cross experts. We now have over 50 people on the ground, helping British victims and their families. To help the wounded, we have already sent a team of military medical liaison officers to assist with medical evacuations, and a C-17 has just landed in Sousse to bring home some of the seriously injured.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/7">It is right that we do everything we can to bring home as quickly as possible those who have lost their lives. We have been helping the Tunisians with what, in some cases, is a very difficult identification process. The Royal Air Force will arrange directly the repatriation of all deceased British nationals whose families wish us to do so, as soon as the identification processes are complete, while 60 family liaison officers back here in Britain continue to support the relatives of those killed and injured. We are also working with tour operators to ensure that those who want to come home can do so&#8212;more than 20 special flights have already brought hundreds home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/8">Since Friday evening, over 380 counter-terrorism and local officers have been at British airports to meet and support travellers returning home from Tunisia, including helping to gather evidence of what happened. As Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said yesterday, the national policing response is likely to be one of the largest counter-terrorism deployments in a decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/9">Yesterday afternoon, I visited the Foreign Office crisis centre to see at first hand the work our teams are doing to co-ordinate our efforts at home and abroad, and as I speak, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase>, are out in Sousse in person, doing everything they can to help the British victims and their families and talking to the Tunisian authorities about how we can help strengthen their security. Over the weekend, I spoke to President Essebsi, and I want to put on the record my thanks for the assistance of the Tunisian authorities throughout this horrific ordeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/10">The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice, which continues to make clear the high threat from terrorism in the country, just as it did before Friday&#8217;s events, but it is not advising against all but essential travel to this part of Tunisia, so it is not advising against visiting the popular coastal resorts. This was agreed by the Cobra emergency committee and will be kept under close review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/11">These are difficult judgments. Nowhere is without risk from Islamist extremist terrorists, and of course we take into account the capability of the country in question and its ability to counter the threat. In the UK, the threat level remains &#8220;severe&#8221;, meaning that a terrorist attack is highly likely, but until we have defeated this threat, we as a country must resolve to carry on living our lives alongside it. Making those judgments means taking sensible precautions, and where there is a specific threat, we will always take action immediately, but we will not give up our way of life or cower in the face of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/12">These terrorists tried to strike at places of hope&#8212;in a country with a flourishing tourist industry on the road to democracy and in a mosque in Kuwait that dared to bring Sunnis and Shi&#8217;as together. The Tunisians and Kuwaitis will not have that hope taken away from them. They will not be cowed by terror, and we will stand with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/13">Defeating this terrorist threat requires us to do three things. First, we must give our police and security services the tools they need to root out this poison. We have already increased funding for our police and intelligence services this year and legislated to give them stronger powers to seize passports and prevent travel. Over the next two days, our security forces and emergency services will conduct a major training exercise in London to test and refine the UK&#8217;s preparedness for dealing with a serious terrorist attack.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/14">We must also do more to make sure that the powers we give our security services keep pace with changes in technology. ISIL&#8217;s methods of murder might be barbaric, but its methods of recruitment, propaganda and communication use the latest technology. We must therefore step up our own efforts to support our agencies in tracking vital online communications, and we will bring forward a draft Bill to achieve this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/15">We must also work with our international partners to improve our counter-terrorism co-operation. I spoke to President Hollande, Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Michel of Belgium over the weekend, and we agreed to work together to help Tunisia strengthen its security. Our ambassador met the Tunisian authorities yesterday to put that into action, including by strengthening the protective security arrangements at coastal resorts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/16">Secondly, we must deal with the security threat at source, whether ISIL in Iraq and Syria or other extremist groups around the world. British aircraft are already delivering the second-largest number of airstrikes over Iraq, and our airborne intelligence and surveillance assets are assisting other countries with their operations over Syria. We are working with our UN, EU and American partners to support the formation of a Government of national accord in Libya, and we will continue to do all we can to support national Governments in strengthening weak political institutions and dealing with the ungoverned spaces where terrorists thrive. As I have said here many times before, if we need to act to neutralise an imminent threat to the UK, we will always do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/17">Thirdly, we must take on the radical narrative that is poisoning young minds. The people who do these things do it in the name of a twisted and perverted ideology, which hijacks the Islamic faith and holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable, but necessary. We must confront this evil with everything we have. We must be stronger at standing up for our values, and we must be more intolerant of intolerance, taking on anyone whose views condone the extremist narrative or create the conditions for it to flourish.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/18">On Wednesday, a new statutory duty will come into force, requiring all public bodies&#8212;from schools, to prisons and local councils&#8212;to take steps to identify and tackle radicalisation. In the weeks ahead, we will go further. We will stand in solidarity with all those outraged by this event, not least the overwhelming majority of Muslims in this country and around the world. For this is not the war between Islam and the west in which ISIL wants people to believe; it is a generational struggle between a minority of extremists who want hatred to flourish and the rest of us who want freedom to prosper&#8212;and together, we will prevail.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/19">Let me deal now with the European Council. It discussed three issues that strongly affect our national interest. On the situation in Greece, I chaired a contingency meeting in Downing Street earlier today, and the Chancellor will make a statement straight after this one. Let me deal briefly with the other two issues&#8212;the need for a comprehensive approach to the migration crisis and the beginning of the UK renegotiation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/20">On migration, the right course of action is to combine saving lives with tackling the root causes of this problem. That means breaking the business model of the smugglers</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/21">by breaking the link between getting in a boat and getting a chance to arrive and settle in Europe. It means gathering intelligence to disrupt the smuggling gangs and using our aid budget to help alleviate the poverty and failure of governance that so often drives these people from their homes in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/22">Britain has already played a leading role in all this, by keeping its promises on aid and saving over 4,000 lives in the Mediterranean. By contrast, focusing primarily on setting up a relocation scheme for migrants who have already arrived in Europe could, we believe, be counter-productive. Instead of breaking the smugglers&#8217; business model, it makes their offer more attractive. Others in the EU have decided to go ahead with this relocation scheme, but because of our opt-out from justice and home affairs matters, we will not be joining them. We will, however, enhance our plans to resettle the most vulnerable refugees from outside the EU, most notably from Syrian refugee camps, in line with the announcement I made in Bratislava earlier this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/23">Finally, on the UK&#8217;s relationship with the European Union, we have a clear plan of reform, renegotiation and referendum. At this Council, I set out the case for substantive reform in four areas: sovereignty, fairness, immigration and competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/24">First, on sovereignty, Britain will not support being part of an ever-closer union or being dragged into a state called Europe&#8212;that may be for others, but it will never be for Britain, and it is time to recognise that specifically. We want national Parliaments to be able to work together to have more power, not less.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/25">Secondly, on fairness, as the eurozone integrates further, the EU has to be flexible enough to make sure that the interests of those inside and outside the eurozone are fairly balanced. Put simply, the single currency is not for all, but the single market and the European Union as a whole must work for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/26">Thirdly, on immigration, we need to tackle the welfare incentives that attract so many people from across the EU to seek work in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/27">Finally, alongside all those, we need to make the EU a source of growth, jobs, innovation and success, rather than stagnation. That means signing trade deals and completing the single market, such as in digital, where the Council made progress towards a roaming agreement that could cut the cost of mobile phone bills for businesses and tourists alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.1/28">At this meeting, my priority was to kick off the technical work on all these issues and the specific reforms we want in each area. The Council agreed that such a process will get under way, and we will return to the issue at our meeting in December. These talks will take tenacity and patience. Not all the issues will be easily resolved, but just as in the last Parliament, when we showed that change could happen by cutting the EU budget for the first time in history, so in this Parliament we will fix problems that have frustrated the British people for so long. We will put the Common Market back at the heart of our membership, get off the treadmill to ever-closer union, address the issue of migration to Britain from the rest of the EU and protect Britain&#8217;s place in the single market for the long term. It will not be the status quo; it will be a membership rooted in our national interest and a European Union that is better for Britain and better for Europe, too. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1177.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/2">The House meets today in dark times. At least 18 innocent Britons have been murdered and many more have been seriously injured in the biggest terrorist attack on our citizens since the horror of 7/7. Every one of us in this House extends our heartfelt sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and injured. Our thoughts are with them at this terrible time. We cannot begin to understand what they must have been going through as they saw on the news pictures from the beach where their families were on holiday showing sun loungers being used as stretchers and bloodstained beach towels turned into makeshift shrouds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/3">The families of those killed now face the painful process of helping in the identification of their loved ones and bringing them home. The relatives of the injured will be worried sick and desperate to bring them home as soon as possible. Others are still searching for any information about what has happened to their relatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/4">The Prime Minister was right to convene Cobra immediately, and I thank him for updating the House on all the work being co-ordinated through the daily Cobra meetings. I add our thanks to Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff, the British police teams, the Red Cross experts and other British officials who are working on this, as well as to all those&#8212;from hotel staff and local officials to the travel reps and other holidaymakers&#8212;who are supporting those who have been caught up in this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/5">As we know from 7/7, support will be needed for the bereaved and injured&#8212;not just in the immediate aftermath, but for months and years to come. Can I therefore ask the Prime Minister to establish a dedicated taskforce that reports to a Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating across Departments and agencies to provide that support? It is right that the Home Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase>, the Foreign Office Minister with responsibility for the middle east, have travelled to Tunisia today. I make particular mention of the Minister, who has stepped into this immensely difficult situation highly effectively, clearly drawing on the experience of his own family loss and demonstrating great personal empathy with those who are suffering. We thank him for his work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/6">There are close ties, going back decades, between Tunisia and the UK. The Prime Minister will have our full support in helping Tunisia tackle the scale of the terrorist problem that now confronts it. We welcome the fact that the Prime Minister, the French President, the German Chancellor and the Belgian Prime Minister have agreed to work together to help Tunisia strengthen its security. Can the Prime Minister say more about what actions are being considered by our Government and internationally to help the Tunisians respond to the economic problems that this terrorist atrocity will inevitably cause, given the country&#8217;s reliance on tourism?</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/7">While we make preparations for commemorating the 10th anniversary of 7/7, the death toll in Syria and Iraq continues relentlessly to rise. This week alone, there have been deadly terrorist attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait, Syria and France, as the Prime Minister said. People are</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/8">concerned about how difficult it is to combat this widespread threat. Can he tell us more about the international efforts to tackle the spread of terrorism? The issue is about sharing intelligence, the use of the internet and social media, cutting off finance, control of borders and co-ordinated military support to those fighting ISIL on the ground. Given the contribution that Britain&#8217;s armed forces are making in helping the efforts to fight ISIL in Iraq, has the international community been asked to provide further assistance?</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/9">The Prime Minister has rightly recognised that the violence stems from an extremist ideology, which hijacks the religion of Islam. He is right that we must be resolute in standing up for the values of peace, democracy, freedom of speech and equality for women, rejecting and confronting those who go along with these extremist narratives. Is he satisfied that the Government are doing everything they can to back up and empower those at the forefront of the challenge within their communities&#8212;particularly families, teachers, religious leaders and community groups?</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/10">The Prime Minister said that, in addition to the new statutory duty on public bodies to identify and tackle radicalism, he intends to go further in the weeks ahead. Will he outline what actions are under consideration and whether he is working with the Muslim communities on that?</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/11">Turning to last week&#8217;s European Council, obviously the biggest issue is Greece. It is in everyone&#8217;s interest that an agreement is reached. This matter is of huge importance to us even though we are not in the eurozone, because, whatever the cause, if Europe&#8217;s economy is hit, Britain will be hit too. Obviously, the Chancellor will say more about that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/12">On migration, instability in north Africa and the middle east is a growing factor that is driving desperate migrants across the Mediterranean to Europe. I ask the Prime Minister to confirm that the capacity and mandate of our action in the Mediterranean will not be diminished with the replacement of HMS Bulwark by HMS Enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/13">We back the action against people trafficking to which the Prime Minister referred. Does he agree that EU action is needed to help southern European countries cope with those who are arriving, including support for a swift and robust asylum assessment, and help from other countries for those who are certified as refugees? Does he agree that Britain ought to offer to help some of those who are certified as refugees, just as we have done for vulnerable refugees from Syria, and just as we have done over the decades and, indeed, centuries, when we have provided sanctuary to refugees who have fled persecution and allowed them to make their future here with us?</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/14">On Britain&#8217;s negotiations with Europe, will the Prime Minister confirm that there is no prospect of any treaty changes being ratified before people vote in our referendum? Of course the negotiations are sensitive, but it is evident that even the people he is negotiating with are not entirely clear what he is negotiating for, and nor are the British people he is negotiating on behalf of. He referred to the announcement at the summit that there will be technical negotiations until December. What steps will he take to keep Parliament and the British people informed? There is an expectation in this country of high levels of transparency. It is not feasible for the British people to feel that they are in the dark.</p>
	<p pid="b.1177.0/15">Finally, we are an island, but whether it is the terrorism in Tunisia, Syria, Kuwait or France, whether it is the refugees in the Mediterranean, whether it is the economy in Greece, or whether it is the radicalisation of young people here at home, this week&#8217;s terrible events remind us emphatically once again that we are all interconnected.</p>

	<p pid="b.1179.0/1">I thank the right hon. and learned Lady for her remarks and for the way in which she made them. She was generous and right to thank the FCO staff and all the others who have been working round the clock. These are difficult events to respond to, but I really do believe that the people who work so hard to co-ordinate the response in Britain do a very good job.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/2">The right hon. and learned Lady was right to draw on the experience of 7/7. She spoke about the good work of people such as Tessa Jowell in thinking about how best to commemorate and mark such events, and that work needs to be repeated. She asked about a dedicated taskforce. At the moment, there is very much a Foreign Office taskforce, along with terrorism experts, the police and others. There will come a moment when we want to bring in Ministers from other Departments, perhaps including the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to ensure that we get these things right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/3">I thank the right hon. and learned Lady for singling out the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase>, with his experience of the Bali bomb. He is talking to victims and families as we speak, and I think that he should play a prominent role in making sure that, as a country, we get the response right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/4">The right hon. and learned Lady asked what we should do to strengthen security in Tunisia. The answer is that it covers the whole spectrum from the detailed work of making sure that hotels have the necessary security screening and capacity in place, all the way through to working with the Tunisian intelligence and security services to ensure that they have an intelligence-led model of policing, as we have in this country, so that they can work out where the next threat is coming from and try to get ahead of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/5">It is absolutely right for us to help the economies of Tunisia and other countries in north Africa, which links to what the right hon. and learned Lady said about international efforts. Following the Arab spring, there was a partnership with north African countries. Some good progress was made in spending aid money to help those countries, but there is more that we need to do. Given the security threat and the risks that we face, not least the problems of the migration crisis, I think that there is a case for using our aid budget in a more co-ordinated way with others in Europe to drive change and economic success in north African countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/6">The right hon. and learned Lady asked about international efforts. We also need to ensure at the European level that we pass measures such as the passenger name record directive, so that we can co-operate better in fighting terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/7">I am grateful for what the right hon. and learned Lady said about the need to fight the ideology, as she put it, and to confront those who go along with the narrative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/8">I think that that is absolutely right. The more cross-party unity we can have on that message, the stronger I think it will be. We will certainly consider what more we can do to back up teachers, community leaders and others, and, as I said on the radio this morning, I am happy to co-operate and work with leaders across Muslim communities, but they should be people who want to back the basic values of tolerance and democracy that we hold dear in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/9">The right hon. and learned Lady mentioned Greece. I shall leave most of that to the Chancellor, who will make a statement immediately after this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/10">On migration, let me reassure the right hon. and learned Lady and the House that we will continue to have the capacity in the Mediterranean, with HMS Enterprise, to save lives. We will offer, and have already offered, to help southern European countries to process asylum seekers. I think that the only difference between us is this. We are drawing a distinction between resettling the most vulnerable refugees who are outside the European Union, for instance in Syrian refugee camps, for whom we think Britain can do more and&#8212;this is where I think the European Union is potentially heading down the wrong track&#8212;a relocation programme for migrants who are already within the European Union. I worry that such a programme would be counter-productive, and that, as I said earlier, it would reinforce the smugglers&#8217; model of getting people here in the first place. There is a disagreement with others in Europe about that. They will be going ahead with their plans, but I think that what we should be doing is helping with the resettlement, and also pointing out that our asylum system has already given asylum to many people from the most vulnerable areas of the world, and continues to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/11">The right hon. and learned Lady asked about treaty changes and keeping Parliament informed. Yes, of course I will do that. What matters when it comes to changing the treaties is making sure that there is agreement on the substance of the changes that we seek, which, of course, will involve treaty change. That is what matters, and that is what we hope to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/12">I very much agree with the right hon. and learned Lady&#8217;s final observation that we should work together with others in Europe and, indeed, around the world, because these challenges are shared challenges.</p>

	<p pid="b.1180.1/2">No country is the world is free of the risk of terrorism, but we must do everything that we can to combat this threat, along with our partners around the world. That may involve very technical measures that we should take at, for instance, hotels and police stations, or very high-profile, high-value work with Governments, but we should commit ourselves to doing all that we can.

	<p pid="b.1181.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement on Tunisia, and for the measures he has taken so far and the measures he is proposing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181.0/2">Three generations of one family from Tipton and Wednesbury have been killed in this atrocity. The impact on their relatives and the local community has been absolutely devastating, and, unfortunately, I am sure that that will be reflected in other families and other communities throughout the country. Will the Prime Minister assure me that he will take up the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition, and set up a dedicated taskforce to support not just the family liaison officers, who are doing great work, but local authorities and other public agencies, so that those families are given the specialist support that they will need now and for a long time in the future?</p>

	<p pid="b.1181.1/1">The case to which the hon. Gentleman has referred is absolutely heartbreaking. All of us have read about it in the newspapers, and we all know how the family and community will be affected, as he said, for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181.1/2">As for helping the families, I think that the first thing to do is ensure that each of them has a family liaison officer from one of the police forces. Those liaison officers are now being put in place. They are experts&#8212;they are extremely good at the work that they do&#8212;and they should be the point of contact that ensures that families are given all the information, help, advice and support that they need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1181.3/1">I can absolutely give my hon. Friend that assurance. As well as tales of great tragedy and sadness, there have been stories of extraordinary heroism and bravery, as we would expect from British citizens confronted with such an event. On bringing people home, what we have said, and what I have said today, is that we are prepared to use RAF planes, chiefly C-17s and C-130s, to bring home the British dead if that is what families want. We are putting the arrangements in place now. It has taken time to identify all the victims and that identification has to be complete before a victim can be brought home, but we will work as hard as we can to make sure this happens as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1182.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for advance sight of his statement. We on the SNP Benches share all the expressions of sympathy and condolence to all the families and friends of those so tragically killed in Tunisia. What occurred there and in so many other countries in recent days was horrific and not justified in any religion, especially in this Ramadan month of peace and reflection for Muslims.</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.0/2">The Prime Minister was right to highlight the longer-term challenge of extremism and radicalisation. He pointed out the importance of getting terminology right and not using the name &#8220;Islamic State&#8221;. Will he join parliamentarians across this House, the US Secretary of State and the French Foreign Minister in using the appropriate term? Does he agree that the time has come in the English-speaking world to stop using &#8220;Islamic State&#8221;, ISIS or ISIL and that instead we and our media should use &#8220;Daesh&#8221;, the commonly used term across the middle east?</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.0/3">On migration, I have asked the Prime Minister about the shameful position of the UK Government 80 years after this country brought in thousands of children in the Kindertransport when their lives were in danger. Will he confirm that at the EU Summit other states agreed to take in tens of thousands of refugees, and that the UK has still taken in fewer than 200 from the war in Syria?</p>

	<p pid="b.1182.1/1">First, I agree with the hon. Gentleman on the use of the term &#8220;Islamic State&#8221;. This is particularly offensive to many Muslims who see, as I do, not a state but a barbaric regime of terrorism and oppression that takes delight in murder, in oppressing women and in killing people because they are gay, so I raised this with the BBC this morning. I personally think using the term ISIL or &#8220;so-called&#8221; would be better than what it currently uses. I do not think we will move it all the way to &#8220;Daesh&#8221;, however, so I think saying ISIL is probably better than saying Islamic State, because in my view it is neither Islamic nor a state.</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/2">In terms of the numbers that other European countries have committed to relocate within the EU, these are people who have already arrived in Italy and Greece. They are planning to relocate about 40,000 people, although there was no agreement about who would take what numbers during what was a lengthy debate at the European Council. I would not, frankly, contrast that with the numbers we are offering to resettle from outside the EU. I would point to the very generous arrangements we have in place in Britain for giving people asylum. That includes many Syrians, many people from Iraq and many Kurds. That is what we have done and will continue to do, as a generous and tolerant nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1182.2/1">The Prime Minister will be aware that jihadists talk about three types of jihad: jihad of the tongue; jihad of the purse and jihad of the sword. Does he agree that although we should address the threat militarily where we can, too few of the Arab countries are pulling their weight in dealing with a problem that is part of their region? Secondly, does he agree that we must cut off the financial flows to the organisation, and name and shame those individuals and states that are facilitating the further spread of fundamental Islam? Thirdly, during the cold war we understood the value of counter-propaganda. Is it not time to rediscover, not only across Government</p>

	<p pid="b.1183.0/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. Of course there are, in part, some military answers to what is happening. We need to crush ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but military action alone will not be enough. As he says, we have to go after terrorist finance and the terrorist narrative. That narrative is shared not only by the terrorists but, sadly, by too many who stop short of terrorism but who buy into the idea of a caliphate or the idea that Christians and Muslims cannot live together. Just as we had to confront the ideology in the cold war, we have to do so again now. In the end, I think that we will win because our values of democracy, tolerance, the rule of law, freedom and free enterprise are better values. They offer young people far more hope than going off and being part of a death cult that subjugates women, murders homosexuals and creates murder and mayhem across the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. In the past two days, I have spoken to my constituent Holly Graham, whose parents Billy and Lisa Graham are still missing following the attack. There has been public concern about the time it is taking for the authorities to update families in the UK on their relatives in Tunisia, although I fully understand that the UK and Tunisian Governments are working hard to get good quality information to the families here as quickly as possible.

Lady for the way she put her question, because I share all the frustration of the families and the communities who want to get this information as fast as possible. Scotland&#8217;s Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, was in the Cobra conference by video-link to Scotland and raised some of those issues himself. Just to bring home the importance of not making an announcement before we have the information, I should say that two people who were down as missing and whom we were very concerned about turned up back in Britain today, having come home under means that we did not know about. The reason it is taking some time to identify the victims is twofold: people who were on the beach did not, quite understandably, have on them passports or means of identification; and, tragically, in some cases it is difficult to identify people after the horrific attacks that took place. In addition, the coroner in Tunisia, quite understandably, wants to make sure that no mistakes are made, so there is a full pathway from the moment of recognising the victim and all the coronial action that subsequently has to take place.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.3/1">First, I agree with my hon. Friend that helping Tunisia on its political journey is as important as helping Tunisia&#8217;s economy and civil society, and we will certainly do that&#8212;I met the Tunisian ambassador shortly before coming to the House today to discuss these issues. In terms of the linkages of this attack, I think it is too early to say. I am sure that more work is being done now, and if there is anything else to</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.3/2">tell the House I will come back at a subsequent opportunity. Where there is no doubt is on the fact that Libya, with its failed state and lack of a Government, has become a place where Islamist terrorists have got a foothold. There can be no doubt about that and while that is the case, other countries in the region, and indeed in the world, are at greater risk.</p>

I hope that today we can mourn both of them, Mr Speaker. I urge that Lisa&#8217;s family&#8217;s wishes are kept to and they are left to grieve in privacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/2">Will the Prime Minister ensure that MPs and their staff are given as much help as is possible and practical, so that we can play our part in helping families get over this? I also urge him to go the extra mile and ensure that all Government agencies act with the utmost compassion, sensitivity and understanding in the coming weeks. I am thinking in particular about the Department for Work and Pensions, education and the health service, where these people might need that little bit extra help which is not always there when dealing with massive bureaucracies. That will help the families to come to terms with this situation as quickly as possible.</p>

He is right about showing compassion and sensitivity, and indeed common sense, in how we deal with these things. Sadly, there are lots of difficulties in informing relatives, not least that the next of kin should be first&#8212;the person named in the passport&#8212;and sometimes family structures and relationships can be quite complicated.

Britain is not a state that is trying to search through everybody&#8217;s emails and invade their privacy. We just want to ensure that terrorists do not have a safe space in which to communicate. That is the challenge, and it is a challenge that will come in front of the House.

	<p pid="b.1186.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. If we are successfully to defeat this threat that faces us, we must work extremely hard to understand its true nature. That is why I commissioned the report into the Muslim Brotherhood. That organisation has an uncertain relationship&#8212;let me put it that way&#8212;with movements that condone violence. I think we see the same with some that have Salafist views. Anything that can be done to further our understanding of where the narrative of extremism is coming from is a good thing.</p>

We are not a member of the euro or of Schengen, but when it comes to co-operation over foreign and security policy, it is often Britain that is in the lead&#8212;whether it is arguing for sanctions against Iran, sanctions against Russia or a better co-ordination of counter-terrorism policies within the EU.

The thrust of the Prime Minister&#8217;s comments today and last week are that, as part of dealing with symptoms and causes, British Muslims must step up and call out those who are silently condoning extremist ideologies, but does he agree that most ordinary British Muslims, among whom I count myself, have no more knowledge and ability to</p>
	<p pid="b.1186.4/3">step up to the plate and call out in that way than any other ordinary British person?

	<p pid="b.1187.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for the thoughtful way in which she put her question. My answer is that British Muslims, Imams, mosques, community centres and Muslims in our communities are stepping up and saying that they condemn utterly what ISIL does and saying that it is not in their name. Indeed #NotInMyName was praised by President Obama in his speech at the UN. My argument is, I am afraid, that we all have to go on doing that&#8212;British Muslims included&#8212;for as long as this poisonous ideology exists. I say to British Muslims that, the fact is, these people are taking their religion of peace and perverting it. That is the reason for standing up and saying, &#8220;You must not do this. This is not what we believe in or what we are about.&#8221; The British Government, who include Muslims in their number, will back all Muslims who do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187.0/2">My second point is that we would be making a mistake if we said that we need just to confront those who support violence. Some people and some organisations&#8212;frankly, we know which organisations&#8212;go along with some of the narrative, think that a caliphate might not be such a bad idea, that Christians and Muslims cannot really live together and that democracy is inferior to another sort of system, and do not believe in equality. Those are people that we must call out, too. I want us to appeal to young British Muslims about what this country can be for them. This is a great multiracial democracy and a country of opportunity and we must also raise our game, as it were, and make this a society into which people want to integrate. It is time to speak out on both fronts. There is a need for integration, but also the need to confront a narrative of extremism, even if it stops short of violence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189.0/1">Let me add my condolences concerning the couple from Cumbernauld who have been lost in this terrible attack. The hon. Gentleman asks the absolutely correct question about travel advice. As I have said, there is no perfect way. We base our travel advice on the threat picture and the intelligence that we have at the time. Before the Bardo attack, the travel advice did say that there was a high threat from terrorism in the country, and after the Bardo attack we added a factual update on the Foreign Office website, explaining that further attacks were possible. But the key decision, both post-Bardo and now, is whether to move the advice to a level recommending nothing but essential travel to the country as a whole. Currently we are saying only essential travel to some parts of the country. We are not proposing to change the advice about the coastal region, and I think that is the right decision, based on the evidence we have today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189.0/2">Were that evidence to change, we could and would change the travel advice and, as I have said, the travel advice also depends on the capacity of the Tunisian system. That is the same for all countries. As I have said, these are difficult decisions. We must not be cowed by the terrorists. They want us to wipe out the Tunisian tourist industry, which accounts for 15% of its economy. The decision we take puts the safety of British people first and foremost. If the evidence and the information changes, we will change our advice.</p>

There is more we can do to discuss with British Muslims how we confront the poisonous ideology. That means making sure that we are talking to people directly and not always going through some self-appointed leaders, who do not always represent British mainstream Muslim opinion. Sometimes that will mean that we will be criticised for not engaging. I do not accept that criticism.

	<p pid="b.1190.1/1">There can be no greater agony than that being experienced by the people whose friends and relations have been missing and unaccounted for since Friday, such as my constituents John Welch and Eileen Swannack. Despite what the Prime Minister said about the difficulty of identifying the victims, which I quite understand, is there no more consular activity that could be undertaken to try to finalise the list of those who have tragically been killed so that we can set their families and friends&#8217; minds at rest?</p>

	<p pid="b.1190.2/1">My hon. Friend asks an entirely fair question. I can assure him that at the Cobra meetings that is one of the most important issues we focus on: what more can be done; are more resources needed; are more people needed? My understanding is that we have police officers, victim identification experts and consular officials on the ground, working hand in glove with the Tunisians. We are going as fast as we can to get that vital work done.</p>

The chief executive of Thomas Cook confirmed to me last night that they would get home free of charge, and they arrived home this afternoon after much stress.

My advice to anyone in that situation is to talk to their travel company first, but they can also ring the Foreign Office line and get assistance. The Foreign Office immediately looks into any case it sees coming up in the media or on social media to see whether it can help directly, and it will continue to do so.</p>

She travelled from the small, quiet Lincolnshire town of Gainsborough, and she did not deserve this&#8212;nobody deserved this. The question is what do we do now. What worries the British people is the fact that the threat is not just there; it is everywhere, and it is here. Will my right hon. Friend resist the principled siren voices trying to prevent him from giving the security services all the powers they need over the internet? Also, if he will allow me to make one further point, many British people view mass illegal migration as a kind of dangerous Trojan horse, so I will support him in his efforts to enforce the Dublin convention so that we return illegal migrants from where they enter the EU and we deal with this problem?</p>

He is right to say that the threat is everywhere. The difference between this type of threat and the al-Qaeda threat that we faced for many years, and which we still face, is that in the latter case we were often dealing with centrally co-ordinated plots, so if we could get on to them we could try to work out how to mitigate them. Here we are dealing with a lot of self-radicalised so-called Jihadis who have been radicalised through the internet, often by people in Syria or Iraq. Hopefully in many cases we will get advance warning and be able to stop them, but in some cases we will not. That can happen in Britain, as it can around the world. That underlines the social responsibility of social media companies, as I said earlier, but also the need for us to have the most modern capabilities to deal with the treat. As for migration, we are signatories to the Dublin convention and we want to ensure that it continues to work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1191.2/1">Two and a half years ago, in his first speech of the UK&#8217;s presidency of the G8, the Prime Minister warned about the terrorist threat in the Maghreb because of the disintegration of Libya. I welcome the Home Secretary&#8217;s presence in Sousse to reassure not only the British citizens there, but the Tunisian Government and people, but the Prime Minister is having bilateral discussions with Heads of Government.

	<p pid="b.1191.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman asks a very direct question. There are several platforms that can work. The G7 wants to have a clearing house for assisting countries like Libya, Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt to make sure that, when not all the countries are offering the same sort of help and assistance, we have more of a working out of who should be working with which country. I hope that that can be put into place and work soon, because it makes sense for Britain, for instance, to partner a country like Nigeria and possibly Libya. Other countries, with their historical links, may be better placed to partner other countries. That is one network. The other is using the EU&#8217;s neighbourhood programme to make sure that we give better assistance and support, and building up the civil societies and economies of the countries in north Africa.</p>

However, in recognising that we have failed significantly to disrupt its financial flows from Arab-friendly countries and powerful organisations and individuals from within them, failed to disrupt its prominence on social media, and failed to disrupt its business activities, what more can the Prime Minister tell the House about concrete steps that are going to be taken to combat ISIL&#8212;or Daesh, I should say&#8212;in these other areas?</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.1/1">I would not entirely agree with my hon. Friend&#8217;s description of this. Looking at what allied air action has done in Iraq, together with the Kurds, we have shrunk the territory that ISIL holds in that country. There have been some very great successes in taking down ISIL social media sites&#8212;taking pages off the web&#8212;and in the past few months a number of prominent plots in this country, perhaps as many as four or five, have been prevented. It is very important that we talk up our capabilities, strength and resolve in this way, but he is right to say that more needs to be done. The finance needs to be attacked. We need to bring to bear more pressure against ISIL both in Iraq and in Syria. As I said on the radio this morning, we are going to have to demonstrate some real long-term resolve. If we are not going to invade these countries directly, but we are going to build up their Governments and their militaries, we have to settle in for the long haul knowing that this is the right answer but it will take time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1195.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The Home Office has now set up an organisation to better identity and understand not just violent extremists, but the various extremist groups and organisations out there. I accept and agree that we have to look at pathways into extremism, but we cannot ignore the fact that young people who have been to good schools, have strong family backgrounds and are not suffering material deprivation have none the less chosen a violent extremist path. That says to me that, while we must of course go on attacking deprivation, making sure we are a more inclusive country and tackling inequalities at home, what we are really looking for is the cause of the ideological linkages that people are making, and it is those we need to go after.</p>

Where I agree with the Prime Minister is that we have to take responsibility for our young people not being edged along in Islam towards them, because these people are not Muslims. We must take responsibility for dealing with that across the whole community&#8212;the Muslim community and all other communities and institutions as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.1199.0/1">I just do not agree with the hon. Lady. Britain is fulfilling its moral obligations by picking up people in the Mediterranean&#8212;4,000 so far, I think&#8212;rescued by the Royal Navy, and is one of the only rich countries in the world to have kept its promise on its aid budget, which is being used to help those countries. Do I think it right, however, to be part of a relocation scheme for people who have already arrived in the EU? No, I do not, because it would add to the business models of the smugglers. The idea that we can only take a moral, upright position if we take part in a European scheme that I believe is misguided is just wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205.1/1">Let me report to the House on the latest developments in the financial crisis in Greece, how they might affect British citizens, and how we will protect our economic security at this uncertain time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/2">The developments over the weekend have been well reported. Greece&#8217;s financial assistance programme is due to expire tomorrow. After tense negotiations last week between the Greek Government and their eurozone partners, it looked likely that a deal to extend that programme would be agreed. On Friday, however, the Greek Prime Minister suddenly announced that there would be a referendum on <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-05">5 July</phrase> on the terms of the programme extension, and that he would recommend that the Greek people vote no. On Saturday, the eurozone Finance Ministers confirmed that, as a result of that unexpected move, negotiations were at an end and the programme would expire. Yesterday, the European Central Bank said that without a programme, it could not extend the emergency liquidity assistance that is the life support of the Greek banking system, and last night, clearly under pressure, the Greek Government announced that banks would not open today and that capital controls would be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/3">There is considerable uncertainty about what happens next. Over the past 48 hours I have spoken to fellow Finance Ministers, the chair of the Eurogroup and the head of the International Monetary Fund. At lunchtime, as we have just heard, the Prime Minister chaired a meeting attended by the Governor of the Bank of England, myself, the Foreign Secretary and others to co-ordinate our response. Britain&#8217;s attitude to the developing Greek crisis is clear: we hope for the best, but we prepare for the worst.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/4">Let me address some immediate issues that will concern people. First, our view on the overall state of the relationship between Greece and its fellow eurozone members is this: whether or not Greece should ever have joined the euro, it is now part of that single currency, and an exit will be traumatic. It was the Greek Government&#8217;s decision to hold a referendum that was the immediate trigger for the events over the weekend and the bank closures today. We should plan on the assumption that the referendum will effectively be a choice for the Greek people about whether their country now leaves the euro. That is a matter for the Greek people to decide, and we respect their democratic right to decide their country&#8217;s future. We also respect the right of the eurozone to set conditions of membership. The remorseless logic of integration is one of the reasons we did not join the euro and do not want to join in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/5">Secondly, I turn to the impact of the current events on the stability of the financial system in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe. Related to that is the position of the Greek banks here in the United Kingdom. The Greek crisis has, in one form or another, been with us for five years. It is one of the biggest external economic risks to the British economy, and the situation today shows that those risks remain. No one should underestimate the impact that a Greek exit from the</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/6">euro would have on the European economy, or the knock-on effects on us. That is why I have consistently argued that the best way to protect ourselves from those risks is to put our own house in order.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/7">Of course, markets anticipate some of the risks. Private sector exposure to Greek banks and the Greek economy is far lower than it was, say, three years ago, so the financial market reaction today has been relatively contained. Stock prices on European exchanges have fallen by between 2% and 5%, and Greek bond deals have increased by about 400 basis points to more than 14%, but bond spreads in other eurozone economies have remained broadly steady. The eurozone authorities have made clear that they stand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the financial stability of the euro area, and we welcome that commitment to the currency. Equally, the British Government and the Bank of England stand ready to ensure our financial stability in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/8">The four largest Greek banks, Alpha Bank, Eurobank, National Bank of Greece and Piraeus, all have branches here. Their UK balance sheets are small: between them, their deposits total less than &#163;225 million. Resolution and supervision of those branches is the responsibility of the Greek and EU authorities. Protection of depositors is solely the responsibly of the Greek authorities. All four branches are open today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/9">There is one Greek bank with a subsidiary in the UK&#8212;Alpha Bank. It is a standalone entity that is separate from its parent bank. It is small, with assets of slightly more than half a billion pounds, it is regulated by the Bank of England, and customers can be assured that their deposits are covered by the UK&#8217;s Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/10">Thirdly, there are 40,000 British residents in Greece, including 6,000 receiving payments from the Department for Work and Pensions and about 300 receiving public sector pension payments. The Greek Government have announced a bank holiday in Greece lasting at least until after the conclusion of the referendum on <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-05">5 July</phrase>, and restrictions on withdrawals from ATMs. Withdrawals will be limited to &#8364;60 per day per account for Greek accounts. The Greek bank accounts of British residents are subject to those restrictions. Their UK bank accounts are not affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/11">International payments into Greece are exempt from the restrictions that the Greek authorities have placed on the banking system. That means that UK Government payments, including state pension and public service pension payments, should be permitted, and I can confirm that those payments will continue to be made in the usual way. However, the situation remains fast-moving and uncertain, and we will keep it under constant review. I recognise that people may be concerned. I have asked the Department for Work and Pensions and public service pensions administrators to attempt to contact people who draw a British state or public sector pension from a Greek bank account. Those people will be helped to switch their payments to a non-Greek bank account if they wish.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/12">Fourthly, there are an average of 150,000 British tourists a week in Greece in July. For the time being the Greek Government have announced that, as usual, tourists will be able to withdraw up to &#8364;600 on cards that have been issued outside Greece. However, the Finance Ministry could impose limits in the future, and the availability of</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/13">ATMs that are stocked with cash may get increasingly patchy. I remind people that credit and debit cards are of course accepted only at the discretion of the business being paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/14">I can confirm that as a result of the limited and potentially unreliable banking services, the Foreign Office is updating its travel advice as I speak. We recommend that travellers should take sufficient euros in cash to cover the duration of their stay, emergencies, unforeseen circumstances and unexpected delays. Obviously travellers should be careful and take sensible precautions against theft. The full advice is available on gov.uk, and travellers should check it regularly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/15">Finally, we are taking steps to help firms doing business with Greece. There are restrictions on the settlement of payments being transferred out of the Greek banking system. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is today publishing guidance for businesses that may be affected. In addition, I can announce that Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs&#8217; time to pay service will be available to help give breathing space to businesses experiencing cash flow difficulties as a result of events in Greece.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/16">So let me be clear: British pensioners are being paid as normal, British businesses trading with Greece will be supported, and British holidaymakers will receive the advice and help they need in a rapidly changing situation. I want people to know that Britain is prepared.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.1/17">To conclude, it is vital that the Government and people of Greece now act to resolve the current uncertainty and ensure economic and financial stability across Europe. Five years ago we came into office in the first flush of the Greek crisis. At the time Britain, too, was dangerously exposed&#8212;on the brink. Since then, with the British people, we have worked hard to repair our economy and ensure that we can deal with risks from abroad like the current one. If ever we needed a reminder of why we must continue working through our plan to deliver economic security at home, we have it today, and I will take further steps to secure our country&#8217;s future in the Budget next week.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207.0/1">These are serious times for Greece and the eurozone, and there are risks for Europe and the UK if an urgent resolution cannot be found. Given that the Greek banks are now closed, can I ask the Chancellor about the immediate implications for the UK economy and British citizens? Our exporters, pension funds and the 1 million British visitors to Greece need to know that the UK Government have a thorough contingency plan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/2">Regarding the impact on British citizens in Greece, how will holidaymakers travelling there this summer be able to obtain full information and updates about the best way to proceed, given the constantly changing situation? The Chancellor touched on that in his statement, but will he tell us what discussions British officials have had with the Greek authorities and banks to ensure that UK citizens will continue to be able to withdraw sufficient funds from the system, especially if the cash machines in Greece are depleted of banknotes? Will he also give us his assessment of the number of British citizens with deposits in Greek banks? They will be anxious today</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/3">about whether they can get their money. Are the British embassy in Athens and our network of consular staff adequately equipped to cope with all eventualities? Do they have the resources to deal with inquiries from British citizens and companies in need of assistance?</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/4">Turning to the impact on our economy and our financial system, there have been varying reports of the exposure of the British banking system to the Greek economy. What discussions have the Treasury and the Bank of England had with financial institutions here and in the EU about the implications for our financial system? In particular, will the Chancellor give us more details of the conversations he has had personally with the Greek and other eurozone Ministers? What has he been doing to urge them to find a solution?</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/5">I understand that the Prime Minister has today chaired a Greece contingency committee. Will the Chancellor explain the day-to-day structure for monitoring emerging risks to the UK position? Which institutions are leading on each aspect of events, and how are the Government co-ordinating our preparedness for any interventions that are needed? What assessment have they made of the number of British firms and the volume of exports potentially affected by the situation in Greece and, in particular, of the exposure to export finance risk of firms awaiting payment?</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/6">Although non-eurozone countries are not directly involved in the negotiations with the Greek Government, the International Monetary Fund has of course provided &#163;37 billion of support so far, about &#163;1.7 billion of which has come from UK taxpayers. If there are wider ramifications for the eurozone economies in the months ahead, there will clearly be further risks for UK business and trade and for our economy. As the Chancellor knows, British business is highly dependent on a healthy and sustainable European economy, but our trade deficit with the EU has worsened in recent times. Does he agree that those vulnerabilities make it all the more urgent that we prioritise measures to boost economic productivity here in the UK as part of our defence against external economic turbulence? Our exporters need support and assistance, and I urge him to include measures in next week&#8217;s Budget to boost productivity and take account of their heightened susceptibility to such turbulence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/7">Given the gravity of the problems facing Greece and the wider repercussions for us and for the European economy, I believe that the Chancellor should pause and reflect that it undermines his position to make bogus comparisons between Greece and Britain. Nobody will take those comparisons seriously. The crisis in Greece has been building up for many years now, and billions in bail-outs have already been provided from eurozone economies. There has been considerable hardship for the Greek people, who still face economic distress. Does he agree that it is imperative for the institutions to continue to seek opportunities for a negotiated settlement with the Greek authorities during the week ahead, and for the Greek Government to accept their part in charting a course towards a long-term resolution and deal with economic reform and governance questions that cannot be ignored? This is surely a time for all concerned to pursue a responsible approach and avoid a disorganised and chaotic outcome that would be devastating for Greece and have severe implications for the wider European economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209.0/1">Let me deal with the specific points that the hon. Gentleman has raised. Our advice to the many British people who are planning to go on holiday to Greece is very clear. They should continue to check the travel advice on the Government website. As I have just explained, that advice has been changed, and we are advising people to take more euros with them than they might have been expecting to take.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/2">The hon. Gentleman makes a point about our conversations with the Greek authorities. Clearly they have tried to, in some sense, protect tourists from their capital controls, because if people have access to a foreign bank account, they can withdraw up to &#8364;600 from the ATMs. But of course one has to think through a situation where the ATMs potentially start to run out of money, particularly in certain locations. That is why we are advising people to take more cash with them but also to be aware of the safety issues involved in that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/3">On the question about British citizens who have deposits in Greek banks, I hope I made it clear in my statement that deposits in branches of Greek banks, and indeed, in that sense, also the host bank, are not covered by the UK&#8217;s compensation scheme, but the deposits in the subsidiary are in the UK. If people are not entirely sure what their situation is, they should check with their bank, but that has been spelled out for them. On the support for the British embassy and our consular teams in Greece, the Foreign Secretary is here, we have discussed this and the Foreign Office has put in place contingency plans to step up the support it can provide on the ground should the situation deteriorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/4">On the exposure of our banking system, it is less than 1% of the common tier 1 capital of the UK banks. As I said in my statement, it is fair to say that as a country and as a banking system we have dramatically reduced our exposure to Greece, as has pretty much every other bank in Europe. In terms of how this is co-ordinated across government, the Bank of England leads on financial stability issues, the Foreign Office covers the consular issues, and the Treasury is covering the financial stability issues and working with the Department for Work and Pensions on payments, but we are meeting regularly. We had the meeting today and we also had a meeting last week, which the Governor also attended. On businesses affected, advice is available on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills website, and, as I say, HMRC&#8217;s time to pay scheme can help with cash flow. Only 0.6% of the UK&#8217;s exports of goods and services go to Greece, so it is a small amount, but of course there could be a considerable impact on individual firms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/5">The IMF was created after the second world war to provide support for economies that have been struggling. We took steps in the last Parliament to increase the capital available to the IMF&#8212;I might point out that the Opposition divided the House on that issue, but it was a sensible step to take. The IMF has precautionary balances, and let us be clear that no one has ever lost money lending to the IMF and providing support to the IMF. Of course the IMF is very important in this situation, not least because of the rigour that it brings, which is one of the reasons why quite a few members of the eurozone are absolutely insistent that the IMF is around the table.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/6">The final point I would make is this: of course we would like a peaceful&#8212;if that is the right word&#8212;or less traumatic resolution of this crisis, but things have taken</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/7">a turn for the worse because of the decision to hold this referendum and because the Greek Prime Minister said he was going to recommend a no vote. I would therefore suggest that at the moment, in the next few days, the ball is largely in the Greek Government&#8217;s court. Of course if things change, there is a very big role for the eurozone to play in helping to achieve a negotiated settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.0/8">The observation I would make is that five years ago we were much less well prepared to deal with shocks from abroad: we had a very high budget deficit, one of the highest in the world; and our banks were not as well capitalised as they should have been. We are in a stronger position as a result of the difficult decisions we have taken over the past five years and if the hon. Gentleman is willing to support the further decisions that we are going to take in the Budget next week, I look forward to his saying so next Wednesday.</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.1/1">My right hon. Friend is right to point out that in effect what has happened over the past few years is that the private exposures to Greece have been converted into eurozone public exposures and, of course, into IMF exposure. That is part of what has happened. One key decision that we took in the previous Parliament was to get the UK out of these eurozone bail-outs. The previous Government had signed us up to those bail-outs, but the Prime Minister got us out of them and, as a result, dramatically reduced the UK&#8217;s direct exposure. But, as I have said, we are part of the financial system of Europe and we will be affected if there is a Greek exit.</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.2/1">Instead of comparing Greece with Britain, would it not make more sense to compare Greece with Ukraine? Both are debtor nations, yet Ukraine is allowed to continue to borrow money from the IMF and Greece is not. Why is that, and did the right hon. Gentleman discuss that matter?</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.3/1">It is fair to say that the IMF has provided considerable support to both Ukraine and Greece. Indeed, the combined support that has been provided by the eurozone and the IMF is considerably greater to Greece. The discussion was the extension of the current programme, and of a potential new programme. Those negotiations were under way, but the creditors in this case were demanding certain conditions. That is what happens when a country is part of the euro, which is why I do not recommend our joining it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.6/1">I am always quietly inconspicuous in this Chamber, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.6/2">Will my right hon. Friend confirm that the IMF has always made advances to countries in financial crises conditional on a programme of reform aimed at minimising the effect on creditors and, above all, on restoring a competitive and effective economy to prepare for a healthier future? It would be quite irresponsible for the IMF or the European Central Bank to abandon that approach at the moment. The best outcome would be for the Greeks to vote yes in the referendum. The one thing my right hon. Friend has not touched on is the great hardship that could be caused to the Greek people if they vote no and their economy goes into total collapse. Are there any discussions going on about the way in which the friends of Greece can mitigate those consequence for the ordinary Greek population? There is no quarrel in this House with Greece or the ordinary people of Greece who are not responsible for the mismanagement by their Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.1211.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is right to remind us that the people of Greece have paid a very high price for the mismanagement of their economy by previous Greek politicians and Greek Governments. Of course it is now a matter for the Greek people to decide their future, and we should respect that. I made it clear in my statement that most people now consider this referendum as one on whether Greece leaves the euro. Of course there are considerable consequences of taking that step, but I do not think we should be telling the people of Greece how to vote. It is for the people of Greece to make that decision, but they should be aware of the consequences. That is the broad approach that we shall take. The discussion of what would happen if Greece were to leave the euro should probably happen at a later date, but there will clearly be issues over the support that the family of western nations can provide to that country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1211.1/1">I thank the Chancellor for his statement and for early sight of it. I welcome what he said about private sector exposures to Greece being substantially lower than they were some years ago. Exposure to the banks is around &#163;5.3 billion, down from &#163;9 billion some years before. That would tell us that the risk of direct contamination is relatively low, but as we have seen today there is a risk to the banking sector across the EU, and the fall in bank stocks throughout Europe is witness to that. I welcome what the Chancellor said about the Government and the central bank being ready to ensure the financial stability of the UK, but it might be helpful if he said a little more about confidence today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211.1/2">In terms of other exposure, we have rather modest exports to Greece, worth about &#163;2.82 billion, or 1.2% of EU exports and 0.5% of UK global exports. That figure is modest but nevertheless important to the people whose jobs depend on those exports. Will the Chancellor say a little more about that? Perhaps export promotion could be stepped up to help find new markets for businesses that might find the Greek export market more difficult; or, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10354" name="Chris Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> mentioned, export credit guarantees and other short-term cash flow help, should they be required, could be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211.1/3">Finally, notwithstanding what the Chancellor said about negotiations being at an end, will he confirm that the IMF has some leeway in when it declares that a repayment has been missed, in that the IMF&#8217;s managing director has up to 30 days to notify the board if a country does not make a repayment deadline? Does that not provide some flexibility to ensure that a deal can be reached and provide a strong incentive for discussions continuing beyond Tuesday, notwithstanding the forthcoming Greek referendum?</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions. I should say that this afternoon we have been in touch with the devolved Administrations in the United Kingdom to ensure that they are aware of the plans and to work with them on any issues faced by them and by citizens and businesses in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.0/2">The Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority are, of course, monitoring extremely closely the situation with the four Greek branches in the UK and the subsidiary, although, as I have said, the subsidiary is protected by our compensation scheme and supervised by the Bank of England. There is, of course, advice available to businesses with export links to Greece, but there are capital controls in place so there are restrictions on the settlement of payments being transferred out of the Greek banking system. Businesses should be aware of that. Cash flow problems can be addressed by contacting HMRC.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.0/3">As for the IMF, I do not want to prejudge the decisions of the managing director or the board. We will just have to wait and see what unfolds in the coming days. It is fair to say that the space for substantive negotiations before the referendum is pretty limited. Of course, we shall see what the outcome of the referendum is. I would merely observe that many of the senior figures in the eurozone have said that if Greece were to vote yes, negotiations would begin to try to find a satisfactory outcome for the Greek financial situation.</p>

The point I have made is that there is a remorseless logic to being part of the eurozone that leads to greater political, fiscal, financial and economic integration. That is why I do not want to be part of it. I have also made the point that that integration, although necessary to secure the stability of the euro, has an impact on the UK as a large non-euro member. That is one of the issues that should be addressed in the renegotiation. We would not be having a renegotiation if we had not had a Conservative Government elected and able to put this issue to the British people in a referendum, and quite a lot of us in this House worked to achieve that Conservative Government.</p>

Of course, the eurozone and the European Central Bank have previously taken steps to try to contain the contagion, for example by setting up the outright monetary transactions programme and the European stability mechanism&#8212;in other words, various bail-out mechanisms that came into operation during Spain&#8217;s financial problems a couple of years ago&#8212;but I was very clear in my statement that a Greek exit from the euro would have an impact on Europe&#8217;s financial system and knock-on effects for the UK.

	<p pid="b.1218.3/1">A further collapse in the Greek economy would obviously be extremely bad for the Greek people and for our exporters, particularly in pharmaceuticals. Even the <i>Financial Times</i> this morning described the creditors programme as &#8220;economically counter-productive&#8221;, and we have learned that the US Treasury Secretary urged the creditors to take a more compromising stance.

We did not say that this was exclusively a challenge to the Greek Government; we said that the eurozone also needed to work towards a compromise. I think it is fair to reflect on the fact that the reason we are having this statement and the reason there are capital controls and the like is the unilateral decision by the Greek Government on Friday. We respect the vote in the Greek Parliament, and of course we will respect the decision of the Greek people, but that was the change in the dynamic that happened over the past three days.</p>

It is an uncertain situation that is changing rapidly, and of course people could be on holiday when it does change, so we are suggesting to them that they be prepared.

We have been working very hard to expand our exports to fast-growing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Although, in general, UK export performance has been quite disappointing in recent years, that is principally because of the weakness of the European economy. Our export performance to many of these emerging economies has been very much better, and we want to build on that&#8212;particularly, of course, our links with the Commonwealth countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.6/1">The Chancellor said in his statement that eurozone authorities</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.6/3">That may well be tested to the full in the coming weeks. Given that the lesson of the exchange rate mechanism is that pressure will undoubtedly be mounting on other European currencies and economies, what contingencies does he have in place to make sure there is no domino effect?</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.7/1">As I say, the primary responsibility lies with the eurozone and the European Central Bank, and they have put in place better mechanisms than they had three or four years ago. The European Central Bank has its outright monetary transactions mechanism, we have the European stability mechanism&#8212;in other words, bail-out funds&#8212;and the European Central Bank is also taking a supervisory role, so they are better prepared. However, I was very clear in my statement that however well prepared they are, a Greek exit from the euro would be a substantial financial shock, which would have an impact on the European financial system and</p>

	<p pid="b.1223.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that Britain has been a long-standing friend of Greece and the Greek people. There is huge affection in Britain for the country and its people, as evidenced by the fact that so many people choose to spend their holidays there. There is such solidarity and friendship with Greece, but Greece has to make its own decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.3/2">On our contacts with the Government&#8212;I was asked about them earlier&#8212;I have of course spoken over the past few months with the Greek Finance Minister and our Prime Minister spoke to the Greek Prime Minister just a week or two ago.</p>

	<p pid="b.1224.6/1">Across the British financial system, there has been a very marked reduction in our exposure to the Greek economy and banking system over the past couple of years, so we are much less exposed to the direct consequences of financial problems in Greece than we would have been a few years ago. More broadly, that is also the case across the European economy. The biggest risk that we faced a few years ago was our exposure to economies and banking systems in other eurozone countries that had relationships with Greek banks, but they too have reduced their exposures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1227.4/1">The record shows that the Prime Minister has regularly come to the House to update it on his policies in respect of the European Union. It is not for me specifically to facilitate such an occasion. However, I say two things to the right hon. Gentleman. First, the Prime Minister is here weekly at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions, and that might be a suitable opportunity for people from a range of parties to question him on that matter if they so wish. Secondly, if the right hon. Gentleman is keen to have a debate on foreign affairs or a debate specifically on Britain&#8217;s relations with the European Union and feels that he could grace us with his presence on the occasion of business questions, I promise that my eyesight will not fail me. I will see the right hon. Gentleman and feel my usual insatiable desire to hear him.</p>

	<p pid="b.1227.8/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As many Members know, I am new to this place, and I hope you can give me your wisdom and experience. This place is a little bit like Hogwarts to me: it has a lot of trapdoors, corridors and conventions. I believe that one of the conventions of the House is that, if a Minister or any other Member visits our constituency, they should at least inform us that they are coming. The Secretary of State for Health, who has been in this House a lot longer than I have, visited my constituency on Friday. I did not find out about it other than through the organisation that he visited. I just wonder whether you can give me some guidance on that, Mr Speaker.</p>

	<p pid="b.1227.9/1">I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for her point of order and the courteous terms with which she phrased it. Yes, the short answer is that there is a long-standing convention that Members notify each other in advance of what might be called public visits to each others&#8217; constituencies. That is certainly, therefore, an obligation incumbent upon Ministers, a fact reflected in the content of the &#8220;Ministerial Code&#8221;. The hon. Lady has, at a very early stage in her career, discovered an important way to register her grievance with Government Front Benchers. She has done it through her point of order, the contents of which I feel sure will be winging its way to relevant Ministers almost before I have sat down.</p>

Last Wednesday, during Prime Minister&#8217;s questions, a number of incidents, which I understand are the subject of police investigation, occurred in Central Lobby. It was drawn to my attention shortly after those incidents that in attendance of some of those events was an abstentionist Member of this House, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13836" name="Francie Molloy">the hon.

	<p pid="b.1228.3/1">I react with caution to the point of order from the hon. Gentleman, to whom I am grateful for giving me advance notice of his intention to raise it. Certainly, Sinn F&#233;in Members&#8212;it is to such a Member, clearly, that he is referring&#8212;have access to Central Lobby, just as any member of the public visiting the House enjoys such access. It is, of course, incumbent on all Members&#8212;those who have sworn in and those who have not&#8212;to ensure that the visitors they accompany behave appropriately and respect the rules on access. It is also, of course&#8212;this should go without saying&#8212;incumbent on Members themselves to demonstrate such respect. I cannot go beyond that relatively general statement, as I not familiar with the detail that the hon. Gentleman might have in mind, but I hope that that is a useful rubric.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231.6/1">My simple amendment would allow the Scottish Parliament to set tax thresholds, as any good Parliament should be able to do, and is a genuine attempt to elicit from a Minister the reasons why the</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/2">Scottish Parliament is not currently allowed to set the personal allowance. I am a lawyer, but I do not claim to be a tax expert or an economist.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/3" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/4" class="italic">Interruption</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/5" class="italic">.] </p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/6">Well, it&#8217;s just the truth. I am not an expert tax lawyer or economist. This is a probing amendment to help us investigate a complex issue, to which we can always return on Report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/7">The House of Commons Library has illustrated the complexity of the issue:</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/8">&#8220;The Bill as it stands would allow the Scottish Parliament to set the bands of income at which different Scottish rates of tax would apply. Clause 12(3) states that where there is to be more than one Scottish rate, the resolution which sets these rates &#8216;must also set limits or make other provision to enable it to be ascertained&#8230;which rates apply in relation to a Scottish taxpayer.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/9">That is not immediately terribly clear, but it continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/10">&#8220;So, if the Scottish Parliament wished to, it could set a zero rate of tax over a specific band of income, in effect increasing the personal tax allowance to all Scottish taxpayers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/11">Importantly, in its briefing on the Smith commission, the Institute for Fiscal Studies asked why the power to set the allowance was to be reserved. That is the question I am asking. The IFS, a reputable body, has asked it, and I am simply using the amendment to ask it again. I think most people would agree that setting tax and then spending the money raised is a prerequisite of a responsible Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.6/12">It is not necessary to go over all the arguments I used on Second Reading or in Committee two weeks ago&#8212;they are on record&#8212;but suffice it to say that power breeds responsibility. The Scottish Parliament must take responsibility for its own destiny in the firm conviction that it is ready and able to do so. So why are we devolving bands and rates, but not thresholds? Is not setting the threshold at which people start to pay tax&#8212;the personal allowance&#8212;vital to the decision-making process? Setting a band or rate but not a threshold is like being willing and able to leap the bar in high jump without having any control over where the height is calculated from. It does not make any sense. What we are giving the Scottish Parliament is only half a power. Are not thresholds much the most interesting part of the equation? We spent a lot of time last Parliament debating that point in relation to the UK economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232.0/1">Surely if the Westminster Parliament keeps the right to set the initial threshold, it can also vary it, thus taking away from the Scottish Parliament the ability to plan its entire budget, because the threshold could change overnight.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232.1/1">That is a good point, and I agree entirely. It does not make sense. One Parliament might be trying to manage its own affairs by setting bands responsibly, but another Parliament could cut the ground from beneath its feet by changing the threshold. I do not know why the power has been reserved, but no doubt the Minister will tell us.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232.2/1">Does it not go even further? Without the Scottish Parliament having control over the rules and the tax base, the UK Parliament could create a load of new reliefs that would cost it a fortune. If we are going to devolve income tax, we ought to devolve the whole thing, not just part of it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-29b.1233.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" speakername="Edward Leigh" colnum="1233"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150629/debtext/150629-0003.htm#150629-0003.htm_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.1233.0/1">As I explained, my personal view is that we should devolve the whole thing. It makes logical sense. As I said, setting the thresholds is often much the most interesting part of tax policy in modern Parliaments. When our friends the Liberals were in power with us&#8212;we remember those happy times&#8212;was not their proudest boast that they, as members of the Government, had lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of tax altogether?</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/2">There is an interesting argument here. For the record, I am dubious about lifting the threshold. It is expensive, and surely more, not fewer, people should have a stake in the income tax system. But that is my personal view, and I accept that there are countervailing arguments. For instance, lifting the threshold reduces the pressure on tax credits. I recognise that it is an interesting political debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/3">Setting rates and bands without being able to set thresholds makes no sense. Of course, raising thresholds and personal allowances is dramatic and expensive, which is presumably why the Scottish Parliament is being denied the power, but leaving aside the need for and desirability of full control, does not full fiscal autonomy lead to full fiscal responsibility? The more autonomy a Parliament is given, the more responsible it becomes. Countries such as Belgium and Spain&#8212;not without their own separatist problems&#8212;provide exceptionally broad autonomy to their constituent parts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/4">That is certainly the case in the United States, where the states have full fiscal autonomy, including the power to issue bonds and the like&#8212;the whole lot, as far as I know. This country is definitely not the United States, despite the best efforts of Mr Blair, but if there is one aspect of America we should like to emulate, it is its vigorous civic culture. Its states, counties and towns have real power and the capability to respond to people&#8217;s needs and democratic desires. Surely we all want Scotland to have that capacity, just as we want the whole UK to have it. The fact that fiddling with thresholds is so expensive makes Governments and Parliaments niggardly about raising them&#8212;each &#163;100 is inordinately expensive&#8212;but why should the Scottish Parliament be less responsible than the UK Parliament? Can anybody tell me why a responsible Scottish Parliament should not also be niggardly about that power and use it in a very conservative&#8212;small c&#8212;way?</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/5">Of course, full fiscal autonomy requires a set of support mechanisms through a formula-based grant. That should be based on need, not obscure variations on English spending, which is why I am opposed to the Barnett formula and want to replace it with one based on need&#8212;but that is a debate for another time. If the UK Parliament issued a sensible grant formula based on the specific needs of the Scottish Parliament, and if that were followed by full freedom for the latter to set personal allowances, bands and rates, I believe the Scottish Parliament would use that power responsibly and carefully. I contend that the more power we give the Scottish Parliament, the less it will be a grievance Parliament and the more the forces of canny, prudent Scottish financial conservatism will be unleashed. Indeed, the best way to encourage the growth of the Conservative party in Scotland is to give the Scottish Parliament more power. At the moment, all the pressure on it is to spend more money and blame the UK Government when we indulge in any austerity programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/6">In the current situation, it is perfectly logical for the voters to choose whichever party complains the most and makes the biggest fuss. I do not blame the Scottish people for doing that. The current system leads to that sort of mindset, whereas the UK system leads to an alternative mindset&#8212;we want politicians in power who are careful about how they vary thresholds and bands. It is because Treasury Ministers have that power that people are careful about whom they elect, and Conservatives do not do too badly in that UK set-up.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/7">With full home rule and full fiscal autonomy, the voter would be in charge and would choose representatives who would raise and spend money wisely rather than just go cap in hand to Westminster. That is surely what we want to achieve, so what is the objection? If it is said that the Barnett formula makes such natural freedom unobtainable, the solution is not the denial of power or freedom but the end of the formula. If the argument is that the Scottish tax system could undermine full UK fiscal responsibility, I find it unconvincing. For instance, the Scottish Parliament spends &#163;37 billion and raises &#163;30 billion&#8212;quite responsible, actually. The UK spends &#163;732 billion and raises &#163;648 billion. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I thought Scottish National party Members would respond in that way, but I could not resist helping them along.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/8">The serious point that I am making is that the Scottish budget is very small compared with the UK budget. If we gave the Scottish Parliament full fiscal responsibility, it is extremely unlikely that it would upset our fiscal responsibility. The Secretary of State may, of course, be able to deal with that point. He has many more expert advisers than I do, and I will listen to the arguments that are made today and wait for his response. Perhaps he will indulge me, if not with a yes to my arguments then at least with a willingness to listen and, in time, to move. If he is not interested, we could return to the matter on Report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1233.0/9">I make my comments in the spirit of trying to be creative and helpful. We can return to these matters, but I hope that the Secretary of State will not just provide a throwaway line from the civil service brief but will try to respond to the arguments that are made. We are trying to create a responsible Parliament; let us give it full fiscal autonomy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1234.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in this Committee, Sir David, and to speak to our new clause 54. I enjoyed much of what <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> had to say, apart from his description of the &#8220;separatist problem&#8221;, which we tend to call &#8220;national aspiration&#8221;&#8212;I think I know what he meant. I am conscious of the time, so I shall try to cover the debate as briefly as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/2">Paragraphs 75 to 79 of the Smith agreement covered issues of income tax, and stated that income tax would remain a shared tax and that both the UK and the Scottish Parliaments would share control of it. The agreement said essentially that MPs representing constituencies across the whole of the UK would continue to decide the UK&#8217;s budget, including income tax. That certainly makes sense with the very partial devolution suggested by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/3">Within that framework, the Scottish Parliament will have the power to set the rates of income tax and the thresholds at which they are paid for non-savings and non-dividend income only. As part of that, there will be no restrictions on the thresholds or rates that the Scottish Parliament can set. All other aspects of income tax will remain reserved, as the hon. Member for Gainsborough said, so that even such things as the definition of income could be changed by a UK Government, making subsequent and consequential serious change to the yield forecast by the Scottish Government. That is one reason why, with the partial devolution, we should all continue to vote on that component of income tax in the Westminster Parliament&#8212;and it is an even stronger reason, of course, for the devolution of all income tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/4">The Scottish Parliament Information Centre analysis for the Scottish Parliament Devolution (Further Powers) Committee&#8212;for the rest of the evening, termed &#8220;the devolution committee&#8221;&#8212;found in its interim report on the draft Scotland Bill that draft clauses 10 to 12, now clauses 12 to 14,</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/5">&#8220;broadly seek to give effect to the extension of income tax powers recommended by the Smith Commission. These would give the Scottish Parliament the power to set rates and bands in relation to non-savings and non-dividend income&#8230;above the UK personal allowance.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/6">Clause 14 also deals with the interaction between income tax and capital gains tax. Currently, individuals who pay income tax at the higher rate also pay CGT at the higher rate. The clause sets out that the rate of CGT that applies to Scottish income tax payers will continue to be calculated using the UK income tax rate limits. That would create an imbalance should there be a change or proposed change for Scotland and people choose to do something in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/7">There were, however, no draft clauses in relation to the corresponding adjustment in the block grant or the Scottish Government&#8217;s reimbursing the UK Government for costs arising from implementation or administration of the powers. Can the Secretary of State confirm that these recommendations do not require legislation?</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/8">The Scottish Parliament&#8217;s devolution committee interim report said in its conclusion about income tax powers that</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/9">&#8220;the essence of the Smith Commission&#8217;s recommendations has been translated appropriately by the previous UK Government into the draft legislative clauses&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/10">and that it had &#8220;no particular concerns&#8221; with &#8220;the drafting&#8221;. However, it highlighted the</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/11">&#8220;significant issues still to be resolved regarding the implementation of the new powers, such as an appropriate definition of residency&#8230;the details of the administration of the new regime (who collects the tax and how it will function&#8230;the need to avoid double taxation and the timing and phasing of the new powers on income tax relative to those already devolved under the Scotland Act 2012&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/12">Those are all matters that I am sure the Scottish Secretary will address. At paragraph 166, the devolution committee also recommended that</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/13">&#8220;details on the implementation of the new powers over income tax be produced before the Scottish Parliament is expected to give its legislative consent&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/14">That is extremely important. It concluded, too, that</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/15">&#8220;any final detail of the fiscal framework and the other matters we have considered is provided to the Scottish Parliament before the question of legislative consent to any new bill is considered&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/16">That is a view endorsed by the Scottish Government, and I understand that discussions on these issues are ongoing with the UK Government, in parallel with the passage of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/17">It is normal practice for the Scottish Parliament to consider legislative consent before the final stage of a Bill in the Commons; with the Report stage likely in the autumn, usual practice would suggest September. However, the devolution committee suggested 2016 as a more likely date, so when does the Secretary of State believe the Bill will reach Report?</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/18">Because of the lack of information on the various technical aspects of the delivery of the tax powers, beyond the wording of the Bill, the committee said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/19">&#8220;As yet, we are not able to conclude that we are content with the fiscal framework and no detriment arrangements as these details are currently being discussed between the two governments.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/20">Will the Secretary of State confirm that discussions are under way and update us on progress, particularly in respect of the no detriment and no advantage clauses&#8212;principles agreed by Smith before the committee reported?</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/21">The devolution committee also said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/22">&#8220;both the process of these negotiations and the outcome requires proper parliamentary scrutiny. We recommend both Governments reach an urgent agreement on just how this will be achieved and for the Scottish Government to report to the Committee on what arrangements it proposes to put in place for parliamentary oversight.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/23">Will the Secretary of State describe what actions his Government are taking in respect of parliamentary oversight, particularly if we do not&#8212;as may well be the case&#8212;get through the debate on all the clauses and groups of amendments tabled for debate today?</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/24">In their response to the devolution committee&#8217;s interim report, the Scottish Government made it clear that they were</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/25">&#8220;broadly content with the clauses in the Scotland Bill relating to taxation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/26">It added, however:</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/27">&#8220;as the Committee recognised, there will need to be extensive discussions between the Scottish and UK Governments over the plans for implementing these provisions.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/28">I note at this point that there were changes between the draft clauses and the Scotland Bill. In paragraph 165 of the interim report, the devolution committee highlighted one area that required specific clarification, so I ask the Secretary of State to confirm&#8212;I am sure he will&#8212;whether clause 12(5) of the published Bill now contains a change to specify that a zero rate of income tax is possible?</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/29">It is also worth saying a little about the nature of the taxation powers, which has been touched on. They are very limited. Even if we include the VAT assignation, the Scottish Parliament would raise the equivalent of around 50% of devolved expenditure. However, excluding the VAT assignation, the figure falls to barely a third. That is important because many of the submissions to the devolution committee called for more. In its written evidence, the Scottish Trades Union Congress called in its recommendation 2.1 for the</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/30">&#8220;devolution and assignment of taxation amounting to&#8230;two thirds of Scottish public spending (over 50% of all spending in Scotland)&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/31">The Bill clearly does not reach that standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/32">The point is important also because it does not match what the UK Government said in their Command Paper &#8220;Scotland in the United Kingdom&#8221;, which claimed:</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/33">&#8220;As a result of the Smith Commission Agreement, the Scottish Parliament will control around 60 per cent of spending in Scotland and retain around 40 per cent of Scottish tax.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/34">Clearly, that claim works only by including the assigned VAT; the taxes that Scotland will actually control amount to less than 30%. The full devolution of all tax on income would help resolve that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/35">It is also worth noting the evidence to the devolution committee of Professor Andrew Hughes-Hallett, who warned of the risks associated with reliance on one single tax. He said a great deal about the possible compositions of the tax base, but in essence his point was that Scotland needs a diverse tax base. We believe that adding responsibility for savings and investment income along with every other aspect of income tax would at least offer a partial solution to that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/36">Furthermore, Professor Anton Muscatelli told the Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/37">&#8220;the cleanest solution would have been to have a package that would have involved not only complete income tax devolution, including the personal allowance&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/38">but additional devolution of national insurance contributions, which would have</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/39">&#8220;allowed some flexibility around employers&#8217; national insurance contributions to try to affect employment, since that issue seems to be of concern to Scotland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/40">To try to resolve a number of the problems that we have identified, our new clause 54 seeks the full devolution of responsibility for all tax on income.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/41">One of the other issues that new clause 54 seeks to address is that raised by the National Union of Students Scotland, which told the devolution Committee that it believed</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.0/42">&#8220;that by only devolving non-savings taxes, the Scottish Parliament is put in a precarious position for any future tax rises, and particularly the introduction of a higher rate of tax. As was seen in the year before the introduction of the 50p rate in 2010, and then in the year following the reduction to 45p, those who it affected were able to shift extremely large sums of money between years and between income and dividends, in order to either escape or benefit from the changes in rates. Without the ability to tax dividends, there is a great risk that Scotland will never be able to fully utilise or benefit from any future reform of income tax.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.2/1">That is a very important point. We always moan about tax avoidance.

	<p pid="b.1237.3/1">I agree entirely. None of us should be encouraging tax avoidance or evasion&#8212;not least a Tory Government, which is why I am sure the Secretary of State will want to support the full devolution of tax on earned and unearned income. It is a jolly good idea.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.3/2">However, whether the devolution of income tax is extended or not, issues of implementation must be fully resolved. I ask the Secretary of State to confirm that, as part of the fiscal framework discussions, the following issues are now being fully addressed: the timing of the implementation of the Smith provisions; the length of the transition period and how it relates to the transition period for the Scottish rate of income tax; how the costs of implementation will be met; whether there will be an agreement to revisit the memorandum of understanding between the Scottish Government and HMRC for the Scottish rate of income tax, to ensure that it remains fit for purpose; the enforcement and compliance regime under the Smith income tax proposals; how gift aid and pensions relief will be treated under Smith; how the block grant adjustment will work, although that is much broader than simply income tax; the forecasting of revenues, the interaction between the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Scottish Fiscal Commission and the detail of how we calculate the transfer of revenue; and the continued role of the National Audit Office in working in partnership with Audit Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.3/3">The key issue is the forecasting that will drive the revenues that the Scottish Government will get and the block grant adjustment. There has to be a fair balance between the role and input of the OBR and the Scottish Fiscal Commission, particularly given that the OBR uses Treasury numbers to drive its calculations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.3/4">As I said at the outset, I am conscious of time; we have many groups of amendments to get through and others will want to speak. I hope that the Secretary of State can answer those important detailed questions on the proposed devolution. I commend amendment 54 to the Committee.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.0/1">I was not able to make it to the House earlier, Sir David; I would like to express my sympathies to everyone involved in the tragic events in Tunisia. Our thoughts are with the families all across the United Kingdom, but especially the people in Scotland who have been caught up.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/2">I want to speak to new clause 32. Part 2 of the Bill devolves significant new powers to Scotland over income tax and other taxes, and it is a real opportunity to provide the powerhouse Parliament promised by the Smith agreement. Clauses 12, 13 and 14 make provision for transfer to the Scottish Parliament of the power to set rates and bands of income tax, including, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> was pushing for, the ability to set a zero rate. The full impact of that and other tax measures should not be downplayed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/3">Lord Smith himself outlined that the measures proposed in the agreement would create one of the most powerful devolved Parliaments in the world. When taking taxation and spending clauses together, Scotland would be only slightly behind the Canadian provinces and Swiss cantons. Likewise, according to the OECD, in exercising power over setting both the rates and bases of income tax, Scotland would rank above sub-central legislatures in Sweden, Norway, Finland, the US and even Germany.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/4">The economic evidence suggests that fiscal devolution can work. It is our responsibility, and that of the Scottish Government, to make sure that it does&#8212;that is the genesis of our new clause 32. However, these are hugely complicated processes; anyone who has tried to</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/5">read the fiscal framework analysis in the Smith agreement will know that. I note that the Scottish National party and its new friend, the hon. Member for Gainsborough, have tabled new clauses that would seek to devolve income tax in its entirety.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/6">I should say at the start that those are perfectly legitimate arguments that have been debated at great length at both the Calman and Smith commissions. Labour disagrees, because we believe fundamentally in the pooling and sharing of resources across the United Kingdom; that is not a criticism of the SNP position, but merely a disagreement on a fundamental broad principle. We have rightly and repeatedly criticised the Smith agreement and the Bill on a number of occasions, particularly on Second Reading and in last Monday&#8217;s debate, but I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11973" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase>: in this instance at least, the Bill and the Smith agreement have got it right. That is probably why there are so few substantive amendments to the income tax clauses. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has echoed that by saying that the commission has made a</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/7">&#8220;pragmatic set of proposals which shows a lot of thought has been given to balancing the desire of Scots for greater tax powers against the practical obstacles to devolution&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/8">It is worth reflecting on the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s current position on income tax. Since 1999, Scotland has been able to vary the rate of income tax by 3p in the pound. Despite the current clamour for more powers, that power has never been used&#8212;incidentally, I believe that it has now lapsed, which shows the problems with the fiscal framework. Notwithstanding that, under the Scotland Act 2012, and as a result of the Calman commission, the Scottish Parliament has been afforded control over the first 10p of the basic rate of tax. Obviously, the Smith agreement and the Bill go much further.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/9">The Scottish Parliament will have total control over income tax rates and thresholds and complete freedom over the levels at which those rates and thresholds are set. That is significant as the estimated devolved income tax liabilities on income tax in 2013-14 amounted to almost &#163;11 billion. That is a considerable sum, the collection and deployment of which confers a substantial degree of responsibility on the Scottish Parliament. If they wish, the Scottish Government&#8212;of any colour&#8212;can increase or decrease that liability.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.0/1">I entirely accept where the hon. Gentleman is coming from in saying that he wants responsibility to be shared throughout the United Kingdom. However, can he explain why we should share responsibility over thresholds but not, apparently, over bands or rates? I cannot see the logic of that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.1/1">The Scottish Parliament will have a significant ability to adjust the zero rate in particular. I hope that the Secretary of State responds to that point, because the House of Commons Library was quite clear on it. However, there has to be some pooling and sharing. Income tax is the biggest tax that everyone pays. Everyone who works pays a proportion of their income in income tax, above the basic allowance. It is important that everyone has a stake in that game. We could get to a situation in which people who did not</p>
	<p pid="b.1239.1/2">have a stake in that game asked what the United Kingdom was for. I fundamentally believe in pooling and sharing, and the Smith agreement struck a reasonable balance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239.1/3">We need a full analysis of how all the proposals will work. That is why we tabled new clause 32. Some adjustment of the powers might be needed in the future. We do not yet know what effect the implementation of the Scotland Act 2012 will have, because it does not come into force until 2016. The question that the hon. Member for Gainsborough raises relates to what we are trying to achieve with new clause 32, because the report would examine the consequences of this transfer of powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.0/1">Is not one of the unintended consequences of the devolution of income tax to the Scottish Parliament that it will affect UK-wide facilities such as gift aid, which reimburses charities on the basis of the basic rate of income tax that is set at a UK level? If there were two different basic rates, might that not cause complexity for donors in tracking what they pay to HMRC and to Revenue Scotland? Does my hon. Friend think that that issue should be considered by the review that would be conducted under new clause 32?</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.1/1">I am delighted by that intervention, because I was going to speak about that issue later. Given the time constraints, I will take that point out of my speech, because my hon. Friend has made it well. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has raised the relationship between income tax and gift aid. Although that matter is not mentioned in new clause 32, I hope that if there is a reporting mechanism, it will look not only at gift aid, but at pension relief. That is another matter that was not mentioned by the Smith agreement, but which has been raised by many of the organisations that have been in touch with us about the Bill. Gift aid is worth &#163;1 billion a year to charities, so we must ensure that it is considered properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.2/1">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the principle of pooling and sharing, and I have heard that argument before. However, if it were a real principle, it would apply to the aggregates levy, landfill tax, air passenger duty and other small taxes that have been devolved. There is no principled reason why it is required to be applied to income tax. He rather gave the game away when he spoke about the ability to vary the rate by 3p either way, which was the original plan, and the ability to set the first 10p of income tax. Why does he think that so little is enough for a nation like Scotland? Why is he so afraid of giving our national Parliament all the powers it needs to tax income properly?</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.3/1">What the hon. Gentleman is asking for is full fiscal autonomy. There are many amendments that will allow us to have a full debate about that later this evening, but I fundamentally disagree with that principle because the pooling and sharing of resources is important. The difference between income tax and the aggregates levy, landfill tax and all the other taxes he mentioned is that they are removable taxes, whereas income tax is not. We should be pooling and sharing resources, and we should therefore ensure that the significant sum of &#163;11 billion is part of the overall matrix of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.3/2">As I said at the start of my speech, I do not disagree with everything that the hon. Gentleman said, but we disagree on the fundamental principle of pooling and sharing. His speech was completely reasonable in terms of what he is seeking to achieve, but Labour Members simply disagree with the broad principle of not pooling and sharing. There is no right or wrong on these issues in terms of what should be devolved; the issue is whether one believes in these broad principles or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.3/3">I find it difficult in these debates to have 56 SNP MPs braying at me from behind, when I am actually agreeing with them. I have no idea what they will be like when I disagree with them. I am paying a compliment to the hon. Member for Dundee East, which I do not do often, and he is still unhappy with my contribution. Never mind; given that they have signed most of our amendments to the welfare clauses, perhaps we will be much more collegiate tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.3/4">I was explaining new clause 32. The Scottish Affairs Committee report on the fundamental principles of the Smith agreement, which was published in March, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.3/5">&#8220;The Smith Agreement represents the best of both worlds. It presents Scotland with much greater powers over taxation, meaning for the first time the majority of the money the Scottish Government spends will be paid for by its own taxation. This will make it more fiscally accountable to the people of Scotland for how it spends their taxes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.3/6">I am confident that the income tax provisions in the Bill strike the right balance between reserved and devolved taxation, although I agree with the hon. Member for Gainsborough that some movement might be required in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.3/7">I believe that these clauses are in the spirit and the letter of the Smith agreement and the vow. The vow is quite concise on these issues. It says very little or nothing at all about taxation. One thing that it does say, which goes back to the pooling and sharing of resources, is that the Barnett formula should be maintained. The Bill and the Smith agreement are utterly in accord with that stand.</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.0/1">Last week, I supported the SNP on full fiscal autonomy and scrapping the Barnett formula, although I know the hon. Gentleman did not. The SNP Members all trooped through the Lobby to vote for that, so does he share my surprise that they have come back today with amendments that do not include it?</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.1/1">Nothing ever surprises me, although I was a little surprised last week that the 56 SNP MPs went through the Lobby with the Thatcherite arm of the Conservative party. That was because full fiscal autonomy would deliver something that would be fundamentally damaging to Scotland. The hon. Lady is absolutely correct. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I thank her for waking up all the SNP MPs with her intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/2">The Smith agreement said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/3">&#8220;Income Tax will remain a shared tax and both the UK and Scottish Parliaments will share control of Income Tax. MPs representing constituencies across the whole of the UK will continue to decide the UK&#8217;s Budget, including Income Tax&#8230;Within this framework, the Scottish Parliament will have the power to set the rates of Income Tax and the thresholds at which these are paid for the non-savings and non-dividend income of Scottish taxpayers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/4">That is exactly what the Bill does, and it is important to highlight two aspects of that quotation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/5">First, maintaining income tax as a UK-wide tax is critical to the continued pooling and sharing of resources. That facilitates UK-wide redistribution on the basis of need, which underlines the welfare state and the state pension system. The Church of Scotland expressed the same view when it argued for</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/6">&#8220;a degree of solidarity across the United Kingdom, where prosperity is shared and those with broadest shoulders can carry the extra weight of supporting those less fortunate.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/7">Secondly, the Smith agreement explicitly mentions the continuing right of Scottish MPs to vote on the Budget within the framework that it sets out. That is equally important, particularly given the Government&#8217;s proposals on English votes for English laws. Devolving income tax in its entirety, which the hon. Members for Dundee East and for Gainsborough are advocating, would place that right in doubt and create two classes of MP in this place. That risk was the subject of considerable debate in the Smith commission. As long as one believes in the pooling and sharing of resources, which we certainly do, Smith&#8217;s recommendation to retain income tax as a shared tax is critical. That is why we reject amendment 124 and new clause 54, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Dundee East.</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/8">New clause 32 concentrates on the implementation of the powers being transferred and, as I have said a number of times in this Committee, the use of those powers. What we are trying to achieve chimes with much of what the hon. Member for Dundee East said, when he laid out the concerns about how the proposals would be monitored, how the number of income tax payers would be determined, the &#8220;no detriment&#8221; policies across the United Kingdom and the complicated nature of the fiscal framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/9">The report under new clause 32 would include</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/10">&#8220;a review of the revised fiscal framework&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/11">given its complicated nature. It would also include</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/12">&#8220;the tax year to which sections 12 and 13 of this Act will apply, and the day on which they are due to come into force&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.1/13">so that businesses are able to plan. It would include details of the number of staff that both Governments would assign to the implementation of the new Scottish rate of income tax to ensure that adequate resources were deployed to make it happen. It would be useful if the Secretary of State responded to the particular concern that the staffing level to determine the Scottish rate of income tax might be deficient.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242.0/1">I am just trying to understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. As I understand it, this is an opportunity to discuss whether the Scottish Parliament should have enhanced powers over income tax. His position seems to be that, rather than take that step, we should have a review of the situation. I can understand the logic of having a review of the powers, but why does he think that the review would be better in the hands of the Tory Chancellor, rather than the representatives of the people of Scotland in the Scottish Parliament? Surely the time has come to allow the Scottish people to determine these matters for themselves, rather than a Tory Government who have only one single representative in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242.1/2">are hugely complex matters, as is demonstrated by the complicated nature of the devolution of the 10p income tax provision in the Scotland Act 2012. The new clause would not prevent the Bill from proceeding; it would merely allow the Secretary of State to bring to the House a report on the progress of implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/3">There is another difficulty. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right&#8212;the Scottish Parliament could produce a report and submit it&#8212;but I cannot, in the House of Commons, command a different Parliament to do something, which is why I am asking the Secretary of State to produce the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/4">It is right for these issues to be raised. I hope that the Scottish Parliament will also examine them in great detail, and will present a full report to both Houses. Our aim is to protect Scottish taxpayers rather than to create a political divide. It is disappointing that, although we agree on the broad principles of the devolution of income tax, Members are trying to bring about division between us. We are trying to be a responsible Opposition in calling for a report on the implementation of income tax rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/5">New clause 32 calls for</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/6">&#8220;a report on the identification of Scottish taxpayers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/7">The aim is to ensure that individuals are either Scottish or UK taxpayers but not both, to prevent the double taxation that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee East, and to deal with cross-border mid-financial year movements, which is important in the context of where people may live or work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/8">The review must include the rates and bands at which the Scottish income tax will be set, and a projection of the impact of the tax on revenues generated in Scotland and across the United Kingdom. That is primarily designed to ensure that Scotland does not become worse off over time owing to the relative tax bases and demographic or behavioural changes in the United Kingdom overall. Such a review would allow us to assess the transitional process, and to ensure that the projected rates and bands accorded with the principle of no detriment for both Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That would protect Scottish taxpayers, as well as taxpayers in the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/9">Critically&#8212;the Smith agreement restates this&#8212;any updated fiscal framework should secure the Barnett formula, with the Scottish budget bearing the full costs of policy decisions that reduce or increase revenues or expenditure. That is crucial to the fiscal framework.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11531" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> mentioned gift aid, and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond to what he said.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/11">I think it important for the people of Scotland to know what their Government are doing about these substantial income tax powers, whatever the colour of that Government. Those powers are worth &#163;11 billion, and they are fundamental to the working lives of people in Scotland. As I have said all along, this is about transparency: transparency in regard to whether additional powers should be devolved, and transparency in regard to the use and impact of those that are devolved. That is what our new clauses 1, 21 and 32 seek to foster.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.1/12">All I ask is that the United Kingdom Government, and, indeed, the Scottish Government, approach the Bill in the same spirit of transparency and openness as us, and agree to new clause 32. We shall be pressing it to a vote later this evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.1244.0/1">As others have said, the genesis of the clause lies in the report of the Smith commission. I have supported the commission since the day, indeed the hour, when it reported, but we cannot ignore the fact that the process was undertaken at great speed. Necessarily, given that five parties were engaged in the process, it involved a degree of compromise all round. It is for that reason that all of us undertook to ensure that there would be consultation following the publication of the report and, subsequently, the draft clauses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.0/2">In a debate in which consensus is not always easy to come by, I am pleased to note that there is consensus on the fact that the clause is a faithful replication of the agreement that was reached under the chairmanship of Lord Smith. However, the consultation that has been conducted since the publication of the draft clauses at the end of January has highlighted, and generated, a substantial number of important matters, some of which are technical and some of which go to the heart of the issue of taxation itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.0/3">I suggest to the Secretary of State that further consideration may be necessary. He has the ability, through the good office that he holds, to bring all the parties together again to consider the representations that have been made during the consultation, and to consider whether, given the complexities and possible areas of conflict that could arise, it is actually worth implementing the tax power in the way that is currently envisaged. If the consultation is to be carried out in good faith&#8212;and, for my part, it always has been&#8212;there are sufficient matters about which we should be talking. That would still allow us&#8212;if it were necessary, and if it were possible to construct a consensus&#8212;to return to the issues on Report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1244.1/1">I rise as a reluctant supporter of the devolution of income tax to the different countries of the Union. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24872" name="Ian Murray">the hon. Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray)</phrase> that people throughout the United Kingdom should feel that they are paying the most important tax&#8212;the tax that puts the largest amount of money into the UK pot&#8212;and seeing it redistributed. We are where we are, however, and we are talking about devolving income tax to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.1/2">I fear that we have one foot in each camp, with part of the tax in this Parliament and part of it in the Scottish Parliament, and that we will end up in a real mess. I am not sure how it is possible to make a tax work when a Parliament can set the rate, the bands and the starting point, but not the actual rules. A particular policy issue in Scotland may mean that the Scottish Parliament rightly wants to incentivise certain employment and income activities. That may not be not a priority for the United Kingdom as a whole, perhaps for reasons of scale or owing to a different approach, but there will be no mechanism enabling income tax in Scotland to promote that certain activity. A new tax relief for people working in the offshore oil and gas industry, for instance, might not be a priority for the UK as a whole, but it might be a priority in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.1/3">The record of our income tax code is cluttered with examples of the use of the tax code to promote certain types of behaviour. I am not sure that we can secure the full and effective use of a tax code if our Parliament is not setting the rate and looking after local activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.1/4">The flipside will be that tax avoidance as a result of a loophole may become material for the Scottish Parliament in the case of a certain piece of exploitation, but will not become material to the budget of the whole UK. It may be extremely important in Scotland to get that loophole closed, but in the UK there may be several others that are ahead of it in the queue, because it does not represent a large loss to the Westminster Parliament. An action that ought to be taken on something that has a material impact in one part of the UK will not be taken because of the strange disparity that exists.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.1/5">If we are going to start devolving taxes, we should step back and have a look at what a federal UK tax system would be like. We should work out which taxes are federal and which are devolved, and then try to bring about some consistency in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland so that similar taxes can be devolved in the same way, rather than adopting a piecemeal approach in regard to corporation tax in Northern Ireland, income tax in Scotland, and so forth. I do not think that anyone in the country will know to which Parliament they are paying what tax, and who has complete control of it. That means that we will not get all the advantages that we expect, such as the ownership and the accountability that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.1/6">I do not think that we are achieving the sharing and the pooling that the hon. Member for Edinburgh South wanted, the coherent use of income tax that the SNP wants, or the full devolution that would make sense. We appear to have become involved in a strange halfway fudge which we may regret in a few years&#8217; time. I think it would be better to step back and try to get this right from the start, rather than trying to find a way of clearing up the mess.</p>
	<p pid="b.1244.1/7">I accept that there are always good reasons why the line is drawn where it is. We must be very careful about tax avoidance through the use of residency, or pretend residency. If I am working full-time in Scotland, to get the Scottish rate&#8212;which may be higher or lower than the rate in the rest of the UK&#8212;I shall probably have to go and live in Scotland. I suspect that I cannot achieve that artificially. If I have large dividend flows, I can probably pretend that I am in Edinburgh when I am in London and vice versa in order to obtain the tax advantage. I can see why there is an attraction in having one UK-wide passive income tax, rather than an active tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.1245.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is raising the issue of what are known in my constituency as &#8220;willies&#8221;&#8212;people who work in London, live in Edinburgh. Those are people who take the trip down to London every Monday and go back on a Thursday evening. According to the House of Commons Library, the UK&#8217;s reason for not devolving dividend income is to prevent people from pushing money into dividend income and taking advantage of a differential rate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1245.1/1">Yes, as I was saying, I accept there are always reasons for drawing the line where we do, and trying to stop tax avoidance within a territory is a powerful reason. However, that has left us here with a</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/2">convoluted tax system where we seem to be devolving part of it, and that is not a sensible approach. It would be better to have a federal income tax which everyone in the UK paid at a lower rate than they pay now and which covered all passive income, and then have a devolved income tax like the one in the United States. It has a state income tax that can be credited against the federal one. That may be a better, more sustainable system than the one we have.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/3">I cannot therefore vote for the amendment of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase>, because it is only half-fixing the problem. It is fixing the issue of the starting point, not the whole tax base. I sense it would be a bit of a rush to devolve the whole thing now in one amendment, so I am not sure I can vote for either of the two amendments, even though I think I agree with them, because we are starting from the wrong position. We need to look at what sort of federal tax system we could have.</p>

	<p pid="b.1246.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful speech and he has the ears of those on the SNP Benches. He is right that we have got a halfway house and we have got to get this resolved. That is what the Scottish people thought they were voting for when they voted for us in such numbers. Is there anything the hon. Gentleman can do to persuade his right hon.

	<p pid="b.1246.1/1">I have tried to convince the Treasury Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11633" name="David Gauke">the Member for South West Hertfordshire (Mr Gauke)</phrase>, of various tax reforms over the last five years with, I would have to say, somewhat limited success, so I am not sure my words will help. If we are to achieve a lasting settlement of our constitution, having these tax rules in the right place with everyone understanding them and believing them to be fair will be extremely important. I do not think my constituents will understand how Scotland can set a different rate of income tax to what they pay if Scottish MPs are still able to vote on the English rate of income tax because it applies to passive income and dividend income. I suspect we will get into a constitutional nightmare, and I can foresee a situation in which Scotland chooses a lower rate of income tax than we have in England, and the English taxpayer will, rightly or wrongly, see a subsidy going from England to Scotland through the Barnett formula and then SNP MPs coming here and voting for a higher rate of income tax than their constituents are paying. That is the nightmare we would hate to see.</p>

	<p pid="b.1247.1/1">I would like to make a little progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247.1/2">Since the Committee last met, I have had the opportunity to appear before the Devolution (Further Powers) Committee&#8212;to give it its full title&#8212;and to listen to its views and explain the Government&#8217;s stance. I can assure <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11973" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> that that Committee will continue to play a full part in my consideration of the Bill as it progresses through the House, and I have assured the convener of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247.1/3">I had a very useful meeting with the Deputy First Minister to look at how we move forward, particularly in relation to the fiscal framework, and I am going to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but in a good way, because the criticism that was forthcoming from the Committee to both me and the Deputy First Minister was that we both said the same thing to the Committee, which was that we are not going to give a running commentary on the negotiation of the fiscal framework. What I can say is that the list of issues that the hon. Gentleman referred to in his contribution will be part of the discussion of the fiscal framework. We will of course keep this House updated from a UK Government perspective, but it will be for the Scottish Government to keep the Scottish Parliament updated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247.1/4">I am pleased to start with the clauses on income tax in today&#8217;s debate. These are often overlooked, meriting only a few lines in the comments received on the Bill from both Parliaments and from the Scottish Government, but that is because, as has been said, they command widespread support as delivering the central aspect of the Smith agreement in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.1247.1/5">The changes made by clauses 12, 13 and 14 will give unprecedented flexibilities to the Scottish Parliament on income tax and are a significant milestone in Scotland&#8217;s devolution journey within the UK. The Scottish Parliament will be able to set income tax rates and thresholds for earned income. This includes the ability to introduce new bands.</p>

	<p pid="b.1247.2/1">Is the right hon. Gentleman aware of the most recent analysis by the Fraser of Allander Institute, written by Dr Jim Cuthbert? This is not an issue about the individual devolution of income tax; it is about the interaction that will occur between the way in which income tax is proposed and the Barnett formula and the Government&#8217;s proposal with the Holtham index, and the conclusion of that analysis is that, when likely shifts in relative population and shifts in relative tax base are taken into account, this will create significant negative dynamic effects. In other words, it will be all over the place and lack consistency, and it will be a source of conflict down the years. Surely, that needs to be avoided by taking a stronger look at making sure the right income tax powers are devolved?</p>

	<p pid="b.1248.1/1">Obviously I am familiar with Cuthbert&#8217;s views on a range of issues, and many of the points the hon. Gentleman refers to will indeed be dealt with in the fiscal framework, which is why that is important for delivering a stable settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.1/2">The Scotland Parliament will retain the receipts from the income tax it is responsible for. This represents a significant devolution of powers, with Scotland retaining around &#163;11 billion of income tax receipts. That accounts for over 90% of income tax receipts collected in Scotland. This gives Scotland greater fiscal autonomy, with incentives to increase employment and increase wage growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.1/3">I emphasise to Members that there are no restrictions on this power. If the Scottish Parliament wants an income tax system with a dozen different rate bands, these powers allow it to do that. Similarly, if it wants to set a zero rate of income tax, it can.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.1/4">As I said on Second Reading, the devolution of the rates and bands of income tax means we will correct a fundamental imbalance in the devolution settlement. Since 1999, the Scottish Parliament has debated how public money should be spent but not how it should be raised. The Scotland Act 2012 started to change that, giving the Scottish Parliament more tax-raising powers. The Bill goes much further.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.1/5">As things stand, the Scottish Government still receive the vast bulk of their budget in a block grant from this Parliament and choose how to distribute that budget according to their priorities. When the UK Government have taken difficult decisions to bring our public finances back into order, the Scottish Government have often condemned us for inflicting cuts. Although I believe those spending reductions were necessary to secure our economy and are far preferable to increasing taxation on working families in Scotland, it is true that the Scottish Government took a different view. These clauses will allow them to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.1/6">With control of the rates and bands of income tax in Scotland, the Scottish Parliament will raise over half the money that it spends. If the Scottish Government want more money to spend on their priorities, such as higher welfare payments, they will be able to increase taxes to raise that money. However, they will have to justify that spending to the hard-working men and women in Scotland who will be paying for it out of their wages every month.</p>

	<p pid="b.1248.3/1">The Scottish Government already have to manage their finances by building in estimates of revenue. That is part of the system in which we operate and part of the decision to have a United Kingdom-wide tax. I will come on to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.3/2">The Deputy First Minister has confirmed that the Scottish Government are already considering using the tax powers that they will shortly receive under the Scotland Act 2012 to put up income tax. The powers</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.3/3">contained in these clauses will increase the scope for action considerably. With the SNP in government, Scots might pay the highest income tax in the UK.

	<p pid="b.1249.1/1">The Deputy First Minister, Mr John Swinney.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249.1/2">Ruth Davidson, however, has set out the Scottish Conservative position by saying that Scotland would never have higher rates of income tax than the rest of the UK. If people elect Scottish Conservative MSPs next May, that is what they will get. Scots voted decisively to remain within a United Kingdom. The UK is more than just a name and a flag; it is a social and fiscal union in which risks and rewards are pooled and shared. The Smith commission looked closely at a range of tax powers and agreed on a package of devolution that enhances Scotland&#8217;s place within the United Kingdom. It strikes the right balance, by empowering the Scottish Parliament, while maintaining the UK&#8217;s strength and coherence. There is a good reason for transferring every power that we are devolving in the Bill, and a good reason for keeping in reserve everything that we are not devolving.</p>
	<p pid="b.1249.1/3">Turning to amendment 124, devolution of income tax is a significant step, but it is important to remember that in the independence referendum only last September, the Scottish people decisively opted for the security of being part of the UK family of nations, and part of that is a single, cohesive income tax system. That is why HMRC will administer Scottish income tax for the Scottish Parliament as part of its UK-wide management of income tax, thus minimising the burdens on employers and individuals. It is also why the Smith commission&#8212;which it is important to remember all parties present in the Scottish Parliament signed up to&#8212;specifically decided after careful consideration not to devolve the personal allowance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250.3/1">No, I will not at this stage&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The hon. Gentleman is one of the most frequent contributors to debates in the House, and he does get to have his say, although not as much as his former leader does. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525" name="Alex Salmond">The right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond)</phrase> is a very frequent contributor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/2">The SNP&#8217;s new clause 54 goes further than amendment 124, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase>. However, to go further than the powers set out in the Bill would break the concept of shared tax and be complicated for individuals and employers with activity on both sides of the border, as they would have to understand and comply with two potentially entirely different tax systems. The Law Society of Scotland agreed with us, saying of the proposed change:</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/3">&#8220;The administrative burden would increase considerably. The complexities regarding the UK savings and investment market may also be particularly problematic&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/4">That would not be in keeping with a stronger Scotland within the United Kingdom. It is not what the people of Scotland voted for last September, and I cannot accept the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/5">On new clause 32, tabled by Opposition Front Benchers, I hope that I can provide some reassurance to the House. The new clause is intended to provide the House with a report on the implementation of the Scottish rate of income tax and the further income tax powers in the Bill. That is a laudable aim, but I can reassure hon. Members that current legislation already provides for annual reports on the implementation of devolved tax powers to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/6">Section 33 of the Scotland Act 2012 requires the Secretary of State and Scottish Ministers to lay before both Houses of Parliament and the Scottish Parliament annual reports that broadly cover the areas suggested in the new clause. Three reports have already been produced, the most recent in March, and HMRC&#8217;s accounting officer for the Scottish rate and the Comptroller and Auditor General have both given evidence to the Scottish Parliament on the progress of tax devolution to Scotland. Of course, Westminster Committees have the opportunity to call for evidence, too. Alongside that existing requirement</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/7">and to ensure that Parliament can have confidence in the implementation and operation of the Scottish rate, the Comptroller and Auditor General is required to report annually on HMRC&#8217;s administration of the Scottish rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/8">I can also tell the hon. Member for Edinburgh South that I am satisfied that adequate resources are being brought forward to deal with the issues relating to the transfer of these powers to Scotland and to HMRC&#8217;s involvement in that process. I would further reassure Members that reporting requirements are a feature of the negotiations currently under way between the two Governments on the fiscal settlement that accompanies the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1250.3/9">I have set out the rationale behind the Government&#8217;s drafting of the Bill, which, as has been widely acknowledged, fully implements the Smith commission&#8217;s recommendations on income tax. The fiscal framework will be an important part of the discussions, and we are giving this exercise the focus and priority that it deserves.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251.4/1">Clause 15 makes changes to ensure that a proportion of the VAT that is attributable to Scotland may be assigned to the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget. The Smith commission set the objective that more devolved spending in Scotland should come from tax raised in Scotland. Control over setting VAT rates is not being devolved to Scotland, because EU VAT law does not allow for differential VAT rates within a member state. The changes made by clause 15 will, however,</p>
	<p pid="b.1251.4/2">ensure that a proportion of the VAT that is attributable to Scotland may be assigned to the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget. Clause 15 sets that proportion at the first 10 percentage points of the standard rate of VAT and the first 2.5 percentage points of the reduced rate of VAT. On the basis of current VAT rates, that would be exactly half, representing, very approximately, &#163;4.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251.4/3">Clause 15 will link Scotland&#8217;s share of VAT to economic activity, providing incentives for the Scottish Government to promote growth. The Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government have considerable levers to do this, for example on skills and education policy, and it is now for them to set out how they will do that. Assigning VAT to Scotland&#8217;s budget will strengthen the financial responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, and strengthen its ability to pursue its own visions, goals and objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251.4/4">Let me say just a word or two about new clause 20, although I am sure <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10842" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> will be saying more about it shortly. It requests a review of VAT refund schemes in Scotland, with a particular focus on how they affect Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. In 2012, Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service restructured in order to streamline and modernise. As a result, eight local police and fire authorities became one. The restructuring stopped the duplication of support services, potentially saving &#163;130 million, according to the Scottish Government. Like other people and organisations, fire and rescue services and the police pay VAT on the taxable goods and services they purchase, but because they are largely not engaged in business activities they cannot recover this VAT through the VAT system in the same way as businesses do. However, there are, in certain clearly defined circumstances, existing schemes that refund some or all VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251.4/5">Section 33 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 was introduced to ensure that VAT is not a cost borne by local taxation. There are two long-established criteria for inclusion in this scheme. First, that a body must undertake a local government function&#8212;we accept that the successor bodies of the former fire and rescue service authorities do this. Secondly, the body must have the power to draw funding directly from local taxation. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is funded by the Scottish Government rather than through any legal call on local taxes, and so does not fit under that criteria. In 2011, the Scottish Government were explicitly advised of this consequence of changing from regional police and fire services to a single authority. The expected benefits in the Scottish Government&#8217;s business case far outweigh the loss of any VAT refunds, and so the Scottish Government understandably continued restructuring with that in mind. The restructuring was the decision of the Scottish Government, made with the full knowledge of the VAT consequences of their decisions. This is a historical request and is not a matter that the draft clause regarding VAT assignment should address. Having set out the background, in anticipation of the arguments we may hear from the hon. Gentleman, I urge him not to press his new clause to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/2">The Smith commission&#8217;s report was very clear about VAT, particularly in paragraph 84. The Government have spelt out in the Bill how this arrangement will</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/3">work in practice. The Opposition support the Government in implementing this part of the Smith agreement, but we have a real concern about the position of Police Scotland and the fire and rescue service in Scotland. A number of organisations have expressed concern about VAT relief schemes in Scotland, and I very much hope that the Government will accept our new clause 20 and that the review will be sufficiently broad based to cover a wide range of organisations, including charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/4">I wish to focus my remarks on the situation, which has already been referred to in part, regarding Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. Surprisingly, none of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, or the Police Service of Northern Ireland, pays VAT&#8212;not even the National Crime Agency has to pay VAT&#8212;but both Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service do. There is widespread indignation at this unfairness in Scotland. Sir Stephen House, Scotland&#8217;s chief constable, has said, in unambiguous terms:</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/5">&#8220;It simply isn&#8217;t correct. It is not right. It&#8217;s unfair and it shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to continue&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/6">The eight police forces and the eight fire and rescue services, before they were amalgamated, were exempt from VAT, but now Police Scotland has a huge annual bill&#8212;a bill that is unfair and unique in the whole of the UK. At a time when Police Scotland has no alternative but to make significant cuts, it is a liability that every year it has to put forward a forfeited bill of about &#163;10 million&#8212;the figure for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is approximately &#163;11 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/7">Why has this situation arisen? The Government&#8217;s position was spelt out in some detail in a letter to Cathy Jamieson, the then Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, on <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-09">9 March</phrase>. The letter from the Financial Secretary explained that the fire and rescue service, and by implication Police Scotland, pays VAT on the taxable goods and services it purchases, but because these bodies cannot recover VAT through the system in the same way businesses do, there are special schemes in place. He then explained that there are two schemes relevant to fire and rescue services. The first, as set out in section 33 of the 1994 Act, made sure that VAT is not a cost borne by local taxation. There are two criteria for inclusion in this scheme. First, the body must undertake a local government function&#8212;and the Treasury did accept that was the case with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. Secondly, the Treasury claimed that the body must have the power to draw funding from local taxation. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is funded directly by the Scottish Government rather than through any legal call through local taxes. Hence, the Government have argued that a &#8220;key condition&#8221; of the section 33 VAT refund scheme does not apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/8">That was the first refund scheme, but there is a second one, which is for Departments and the NHS. It is doubtful whether the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service would be in a position to claim refunds on outsource services, but the Treasury made it clear that the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service would not be eligible in principle because it is not a &#8220;central government&#8221; Department. To be honest, those reasons might be technically valid, but they are also morally suspect and unjustifiable. I am a great believer in the saying, &#8220;Where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way.&#8221; Clearly, the situation in Scotland with regard to</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/9">the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and to Police Scotland is an anomaly, which applies to only one part of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.0/10">I very much hope that the Treasury can muster the wherewithal to address that anomaly, and to do it through our proposed new clause 20.</p>

	<p pid="b.1254.1/1">Well, things can be changed through political will. As I have said, where there is a will to make that change, a change can be made. A way can be found, if there is the desire to do so. I very much hope that the Government listen carefully to what has been said this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.1/2">I must say that something else worries me, too. I refer again to the letter to Cathy Jamieson from the Financial Secretary. The penultimate paragraph says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.1/3">&#8220;In 2011 the Scottish Government were explicitly advised of this potential consequence of changing from regional police forces to a single authority as part of the proposed revised funding model for Police Scotland. At the time they took the decision to make these reforms they would have known they would no longer be eligible for the VAT refunds as a result.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.1/4">There we have it in black and white: the Scottish National party Government were warned that their plans to reorganise emergency services would, in effect, cost millions in VAT refunds. Yes, cost savings might have been made; but they knew the situation and they were prepared to see that loss occur. They still pressed ahead with their plans. This is in part a mess of the SNP&#8217;s own making, compounded by an indifferent and apathetic Tory-led Government here in Westminster. The sensible thing surely would have been for the Scottish Government and the UK Government to have come together and sort out this problem before Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service were constituted on an all-Scotland basis. That is the common-sense thing that should have happened. But that is in the past.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255.0/1">No, of course not. What I am saying is that it would have been far better if the Government in Scotland and the Government in London had sat down maturely and worked things out for the benefit of services in Scotland rather than pursue a fixation with the idea that things had to be brought together on a centralised basis in Scotland, irrespective of the consequences. The Government were absolutely adamant on this. Presumably they could not find parliamentary time, or did not have the political inclination to bring forward an amendment to have a scheme that would have benefited everyone.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/2">The sensible thing would have been to do precisely what I have said, but that is in the past. The important thing now is to move forward and resolve this situation. Our proposed new clause 20 calls for a review of the situation. It is a modest request, which I very much hope that the Government will accept. If they do accept it, it could provide an opportunity for everyone to get together and, hopefully, resolve the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/3">It has been suggested by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations that VAT rebates should be devolved so that they better conform to devolved policy to support society and public services. A suggestion has been made that the UK Government could allocate a Barnett formula-based share of the VAT rebates to the Scottish block grant. That is one possibility, but, like all the other suggestions, it needs to be soberly and carefully discussed. It could be a part of the review that we propose. I hope that the Government will accept our amendment so that we can have that meaningful discussion and reach a decision for the benefit of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255.1/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate on clause 15 stand part and proposed new clause 20 in the name of the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/2">Let us turn to the way that the Smith commission has spoken about the assignation of a proportion of VAT. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/3">&#8220;The receipts raised in Scotland by the first 10 percentage points of the standard rate&#8230;will be assigned&#8230;All other aspects of VAT will remain reserved.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/4">The Scottish Parliament Information Centre analysis for the Scottish Parliament Devolution (Further Powers) Committee referred to it in its interim report on the draft Scotland Bill clauses. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/5">&#8220;Draft clause 13 [now 15] would give effect to the Smith Commission recommendation that the Scottish Government be assigned receipts from the first ten percentage points of VAT. With the agreement of both governments it also proposes to go slightly further by notionally assigning 2.5 percentage points of the reduced rate of VAT as well&#8230;The amount of VAT receipts attributable to Scotland is to be the subject of an agreement between the UK Government and the Scottish Government.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/6">It did point out that there are no draft clauses in relation to the corresponding adjustment to the block grant. Hopefully, the Minister will confirm that that does not require legislation. In effect, the Scotland Bill proposes the assignation of half of VAT receipts to the Scottish Parliament. However, that will provide no actual control of VAT.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/7">The Devolution (Further Powers) Committee had no particular concerns with the draft clauses, but it did want details of the assignment of VAT revenues and the share of any benefits to be produced&#8212;the mechanics of</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/8">the assignment&#8212;before the Scottish Parliament could be expected to give its legislative consent. The committee said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/9">&#8220;There is still significant uncertainty on how the assignment of a share of VAT revenues will be calculated and whether the Scottish Government will be able to reap the rewards of any economic stimulus that yields higher VAT revenues.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/10">It is also worth noting that the Devolution (Further Powers) Committee&#8217;s analysis paper, which set out the differences between the draft clauses and the published Bill, noted that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/11">&#8220;No further detail is provided on the assignment of VAT revenues, or the corresponding block grant adjustment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/12">There are a number of technical issues for consideration notwithstanding the fact that there is no particular issue with the legislation as such.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/13">The committee&#8217;s interim report considered the evidence on VAT assignment from a range of sources. It said that the bulk of the evidence received by the committee, while welcoming the principle, called for greater clarity in how the assignment of revenues would work. As the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland told the committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/14">&#8220;Clause 13 in the &#8216;Draft Scotland Clauses 2015&#8217; regarding VAT delivers the mechanics of the assignment of VAT, but with the large caveat that it applies &#8216;where there is an agreement between the Treasury and Scottish Ministers&#8217;...The rules for agreeing this have not been provided and it may not be easy to identify &#8216;Scottish VAT&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/15">I take on board what the Scottish Secretary said earlier about not giving a running commentary, but on that specific point&#8212;and I shall have more specific questions&#8212;at least I hope we can get clarity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/16">In oral evidence to the Scottish Parliament committee, Charlotte Barbour of ICAS elaborated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/17">&#8220;The assignment of VAT offers more opportunity for discussions on how that might be calculated. It slots in with the difficulties with the fiscal framework&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/18">we discussed those in the last debate&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/19">&#8220;and some of the no-detriment issues&#8221;&#8212;[<i>Scottish Parliament, Official Report</i>,<i> Devolution (Further Powers) Committee,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2015-02-05">5 February 2015</phrase>; c. 4.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/20">I mentioned those previously. The Scottish Trades Union Congress was broadly supportive of the assignment of VAT. Its deputy general secretary told the Committee that</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/21">&#8220;I am quite a fan of assigned revenue&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/22">but he took the point that</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/23">&#8220;it is not a power in the sense of being usable to promote particular behaviours&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/24">However, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/25">&#8220;A degree of assigned revenue clearly rewards the Scottish Government for economic growth and, in our view, the closer we get to an amount of revenue that is derived from positive actions undertaken by the Scottish Government, the better.&#8221;&#8212;[<i>Scottish Parliament, Official Report</i>,<i> Devolution (Further Powers) Committee,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-15">15 January 2015</phrase>; c. 13.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/26">I do not think that any of us would disagree with that. We want responsibility, which rather prompts the question that given that there is no control over VAT, why assign only half of it? Why not assign it all? The Scottish Government could then quite rightly benefit, if there was a benefit, from the entire rise in VAT in Scotland rather than just half of it and could take responsibility if there was a shortfall, not just for half the shortfall.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/27">Speaking to the committee, John Swinney, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Constitution and Economy, highlighted two issues for discussion with the UK Government, which are both important:</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/28">&#8220;One is establishing the analytical base for how VAT should be apportioned and the other is the policy question of guaranteeing that if those estimates are exceeded, Scotland retains the benefit of that improved economic performance&#8221;.&#8212;[<i>Scottish Parliament, Official Report</i>,<i>Devolution</i><i> (Further Powers) Committee</i> <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-12">12 March 2015</phrase>; c. 26.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/29">The former Secretary of State for Scotland also commented on the issue of VAT in a letter to the Committee, in which he said that he could</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/30">&#8220;confirm that VAT assignment will link the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget with economic activity in Scotland, providing incentives for growth. The amount of VAT to be assigned&#8230;will be based on an estimated share of the total VAT generated in the UK...The UK and Scottish Governments will need to agree a methodology&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/31">Will the Minister provide further details, not on the specific discussions with the Scottish Government but on the themes? What are the options for how VAT will be assigned? Will it, for example, be a consumption-based approach? How can we improve the robustness of the measure and the timescales, for example by improving the survey data? What will be the costs of implementation and how will they be met? Does there need to be a proxy measure over a transition period until the methodology is robust? Has any thought been given to indexation and comparable measures of growth? What has been said about governance and accountability, for example developing a separate strand to the memorandum of understanding with the HMRC on VAT to expand the role of the project board?</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/32">The question of the robustness of the survey data is vital. At present, VAT is estimated by the Scottish Government in the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report, based on a household survey of expenditure, therefore missing tourism spend entirely. That is corrected by a percentage share adjustment, meaning that the Scottish Government estimate what percentage of UK tourism happens in Scotland, but if the Scottish Government managed to increase tourism spend through other actions, such as reducing air passenger duty, that would not show up according to the current methodology. We therefore need to agree a new robust methodology and, perhaps, an interim measure until that methodology is in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/33">As the Minister has said, VAT cannot be varied within a state and we understand and respect that. So let me repeat the question: why give only half rather than all, unless to camouflage the fact that the tax over which Scotland will have control will be such a small share of our tax base? Could the assignation of VAT revenue be designed simply to make that number seem a little bigger?</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/34">Let me turn to new clause 20, on the subject of VAT on Police Scotland and the fire service. We heard <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10842" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> describe the amendment, which proposes a review of the application of the VAT refund scheme for business in Scotland. It has been tabled with the intention, it would appear, of addressing the anomaly of the inability of the Scottish Police Authority and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to reclaim VAT. Although we agree that that is an inequitable position for both services, we do not necessarily believe that a review is the way to address it. Instead, the UK Government&#8212;as the hon. Gentleman</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/35">said, where there is a will, there is a way&#8212;should simply amend the VAT status of the single police service and fire and rescue service in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/36">There are some technical issues with the new clause. VAT is UK-wide, so any review could not be confined solely to Scotland. Proposed subsection (1) requires a review of VAT refund schemes for &#8220;businesses&#8221; but there is no business VAT refund scheme as such. Subsection (2) would make the VAT refund scheme applicable to central Government bodies that sit outwith EU law but are the subject of an EU-wide consultation process. The reference to Police Scotland should instead be to the Scottish Police Authority, which is the legal entity and VAT-registered body; Police Scotland is the part of the SPA relating to police officers. However, notwithstanding all of that and the fact that the new clause simply proposes a review, it never does any harm to find out that what we thought we knew was correct&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1258.4/1">I rise to say a few words in support of new clause 20, tabled by the hon. Members for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) and for Caerphilly (Wayne David). When considering schemes such as those that lie at the heart of the new clause, it is worth starting with the principle that underpins them. Is it, as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury suggested, the principle that local government finance should not go straight into Treasury coffers? I can understand that principle and it holds water in so far as it relates to the scheme for police and fire services across the UK, as originally envisaged. The difficulty for the Minister, however, is that there are other schemes of a similar nature that go beyond the ambit of police, fire and other rescue services. The hon. Member for Caerphilly mentioned one related to the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1258.4/2">The principle that underlines such schemes is fairly sensible&#8212;that for public services to pay money back into the Treasury is essentially an exercise in robbing Peter to pay Paul. It only creates work for accountants</p>
	<p pid="b.1258.4/3">and achieves no public good. There is a more fundamental principle at stake, however, in the proposal before the Committee and in the new clause tabled by the Labour party. That is the principle that there should be equality of treatment across the board and across the United Kingdom. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25400" name="Callum McCaig">The hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Callum McCaig)</phrase> hit the nail on the head when he referred to the pooling and sharing of risks. I think I have perhaps a greater commitment to that principle than he has, but I must say in all candour to those on the Treasury Bench that if they are sincere in their belief that risks and rewards should be pooled and shared across the UK, whatever the technicalities this situation should not be allowed to continue. Whether it is done through the review in the new clause or through action in the forthcoming Finance Bill, amendments for the sake of the continued constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom should be produced in early course.</p>

	<p pid="b.1259.0/1">Let me address the issues that have arisen during the debate, starting with new clause 20 and the refund situation. It is correct to say that there is a refund scheme for Government Departments and the NHS. This scheme refunds the VAT incurred on certain outsourced services. It was introduced to ensure that irrecoverable VAT does not dissuade Government Departments from contracting out services where this results in greater efficiencies of scale. There is also &#8212;this is relevant to the discussion&#8212;a refund scheme in respect of matters that can draw funding directly from local taxation. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is funded by the Scottish Government, rather than through any legal call on local taxes, so it does not meet this criterion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.0/2">That was not the case prior to the reforms brought in by the Scottish Government. I stress that this was a choice of the Scottish Government, with their eyes wide open to the fact that the VAT refund scheme would not be available in the event of that reform. They decided, as they were perfectly entitled to do, to proceed with those reforms, notwithstanding that loss.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-29b.1259.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25273" speakername="Peter Grant" colnum="1259"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150629/debtext/150629-0003.htm#150629-0003.htm_spnew57">
	<p pid="b.1259.1/1">For 18 years, during which I was a member of both Fife regional council and Fife council, they were unitary authorities but we did not have a joint police board and we did not elect or appoint members from different authorities to a separate organisation in which the police were funded entirely by a budget decision of a single authority. In effect, they were operating financially as though they were the education service or the social work service. At that point they had the same VAT treatment as the police in Strathclyde or Lothian, which were managed by a joint board. Fife police did not have, in the Minister&#8217;s words, a legal call on the resources of the authority. They were funded because the authority thought it was the right thing to do, not because the police had the right to demand the funding from us. Will the Minister explain why the same position does not now apply to the Police Service of Scotland or the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service?</p>

	<p pid="b.1259.2/1">As I understand the situation that the hon. Gentleman set out, if services were funded through local taxation, the refund scheme was available. That is</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.2/2">no longer the case, as the changes have been made. It therefore does not fall within section 33 as it currently stands. As <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10842" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> acknowledged, it is technically valid that the refund scheme does not apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.2/3">Many arguments are made in respect of the VAT refund schemes, and requests are made that they be broadened and applied to additional organisations. It is customary for the case to be made that charities, for example, should benefit from such refunds. That comes with significant fiscal cost. Now is not the time to run through the whole argument, but there may well be a case for reconsidering the position, but we should not look at it in isolation because of a particular decision that was made in one case. If there is a case to do that, the matter should be looked at in the round, not just on the basis of one case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260.4/1">I understand what the Treasury Minister says about the number of requests received for exemptions from section 33, but this is not a new exemption. There is a net gain of many millions of pounds a year to the Treasury from this change. Therefore the net effect of changing it back would be zero. We are not asking for exemption from section 33 to be opened up to charities. That is a separate debate. This is a case where the Treasury is a net beneficiary. How does Scotland get that money back?</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.0/1">As I said, a decision was made by the Scottish Government, believing that the efficiency savings were more than sufficient to outweigh the costs incurred by losing the section 33 refund.

	<p pid="b.1261.1/1">We keep hearing about respect. We all know why the Scottish Government introduced the change&#8212;it creates efficiency in the delivery of police and fire services in Scotland. A clear case has been made by many of my hon. Friends and by those on the Labour Benches as well. If there is a genuine feeling of mutual respect between the Government in Scotland and the Government in Westminster, all the Treasury has to do is make sure that we get the VAT back and we will invest it in front-line services to benefit the people of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.2/1">We respected the Scottish Government&#8217;s decision, because they were perfectly entitled to decide to reform the police and fire services in the way they did, but they knew what the consequences of the law of the land would be with regard to VAT. That decision was taken and it would be unreasonable for us to maintain the existing legislation, given that there are many demands on section 33.</p>

That reflects the agreement reached by the five main political parties under the auspices of Lord Smith. It represents a balance between providing a sufficient incentive for Scotland to grow its economy, relative to the rest of the United Kingdom, in order to increase its revenue from VAT and exposing the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget to potential fluctuations in VAT receipts.</p>

Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> made a number of technical points about how that will work. I accept that a number of details will need to be worked out as part of the fiscal framework. There is a need to agree the methodology for estimating how much VAT is generated by Scotland and by the rest of the United Kingdom. The UK and Scottish Governments will also need to agree the operating principles, including mechanisms for verifying that the methodology has been applied correctly, how many adjustments might be carried out and arrangements for audit and transparency, including publication of results. It is worth pointing out that other countries operate similar systems and could provide a reasonable starting point from which to build.</p>

	<p pid="b.1262.5/1">Clauses 16, 17 and 18 implement the Smith commission&#8217;s recommendations by fully devolving two taxes: air passenger duty and the aggregates levy. Those taxes will be switched off in Scotland and the Scottish Parliament will then have full competence to maintain, redesign or scrap them. The changes made by clauses 16 and 18 will switch off APD in Scotland and give the Scottish Government the power to charge their own tax on passengers departing from Scottish airports. The Scottish Government will be free to make their own arrangements with regard to the design and collection of any replacement tax. Alongside that, funding for the Scottish Government will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the APD that would have been raised in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.5/2">Clauses 17 and 18 and schedule 1 make changes to ensure that the UK aggregates levy can be fully devolved to Scotland. The Smith commission agreement stated that there would be full devolution of the levy to Scotland following resolution of the legal challenges against the levy. The changes made by clause 17 will give the Scottish Parliament the power to charge a tax on the commercial exploitation of aggregate. The clause also introduces schedule 1, and together they enable the existing UK levy to be disapplied to Scotland. These provisions allow the Scottish Government freedom in the design and implementation of any tax on the commercial exploitation of aggregate in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263.0/1">Amendment 36 would, in essence, have opposed clause 16 standing part of the Bill, because I want the Committee to explore the specific issues related to air passenger duty and the more general principles about tax competition between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom that may well evolve from a discussion on air passenger duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263.0/2">Some of us who voted to set up the Scottish Parliament in the first place now think that, although it seemed a very bold decision at the time, it was less bold than it might have been and that if we had the benefit of being able to go back in time&#8212;we do have the benefit of hindsight&#8212;the proposals that the Government are making might well have been those that should have been put before the House after the 1997 general election, with us now moving towards full fiscal autonomy for the Scottish Parliament. It was a fundamental mistake to set up a Scottish Parliament with mainly spending powers and no tax-raising powers, apart from the plus or minus 3p on income tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. One of the mistakes is that there is no incentive for the Scottish Government to grow the economy. A great example that we have in the Hebrides is that the Scottish Government have put a road-equivalent tariff on to the ferries. This has grown the economy in the west of Scotland, but the increase in tax revenue is not going to the Government that funds it but to Westminster, which gives no extra cash and further incentives to roll it out further across the west coast. It is similar with childcare and a number of other issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a pretty fundamental point about devolution. When the House was making a decision to devolve powers, it would have been sensible to settle on a grant basis that was fair between Scotland, England and Wales, which the Barnett formula was not, and then allow the Scottish Parliament to raise taxes on that basis, so that if it wanted better-quality services, it could have had higher taxes and, if it was more efficient, it could have had better services or lower taxes, and so on. That is a very clear principle.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263.3/1">The important point I am driving at is that, if the Scottish Government had proper control of their taxes, they could have grown the economy more and that growth would have delivered far more than the zero-sum game of who has got and has not got what in the UK. It is the ability to grow the economy that tax powers would give that is really fundamental.</p>

	<p pid="b.1263.4/1">If the hon. Gentleman is saying that Scotland, or any other devolved authority, should benefit from the initiatives it takes and from its own efficiencies, I agree completely. We are moving that way, but the Bill does not move far enough. No Minister or shadow Minister has been able to explain to me, in any of our debates, why we should have the unfair funding in the Barnett formula.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263.4/2">Those are the basic principles. I now want to explore how, if taxation is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the United Kingdom Government will respond to competition. Air passenger duty is a very good example. As I understand it, the SNP intend to reduce air passenger</p>
	<p pid="b.1263.4/3">duty by 50% and then reduce it to zero. That is quite a sensible policy for the SNP to follow. For that matter, it is a sensible policy for the United Kingdom Government to follow, because a number of consultants&#8217; reports have shown that there is almost certainly likely to be a benefit for the whole United Kingdom if air passenger duty is taken away.</p>
	<p pid="b.1263.4/4">Every other country in the European Union has moved either to very low rates of APD or, as in the Netherlands, to zero. It is therefore a sensible policy, but the Government do not seem to have a clear position on what they will do about the very unfair competition between regional airports.</p>

	<p pid="b.1264.0/1">Air passenger duty is a perfect illustration of what I said earlier. If the Scottish Government decided to lower APD and that upped the rate of economic activity in Scotland, they should benefit from the fruits of that activity. The benefits should not go to Westminster, because it would not compensate the Scottish Government for that initiative.</p>

	<p pid="b.1264.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-20">20 January</phrase>, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told the Treasury Committee, in response to a question asked by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25220" name="Mike Kane">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase> about that very point:</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/2">&#8220;I think the best approach to dealing with this concern, which I think is perfectly legitimate, is to cross the political boundaries of our two parties to try to find a solution that helps these regional airports that can be affected by an air passenger duty decision north of the border.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/3">HMRC has done some work on this and I think it anticipated that Manchester airport would lose around 3% of its traffic and Newcastle could lose around 10% of its traffic. That was work carried out a couple of years ago&#8230; I think you and I&#8212;I made the same offer to Ed Balls&#8212;could work to help regional airports in the north of England if the Scottish Government were to go down the road of dramatically cutting its air passenger duty.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/4">Further to that, the Chancellor told the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-27">27 January</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/5">&#8220;We have a couple of years to work this out&#8212;it does not have be done tonight or tomorrow&#8212;and we can work out a plan that protects the brilliant Newcastle, Manchester and other regional airports.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2015-01-27.726"><i>Official Report</i>, 27 January 2015; Vol. 591, c. 726</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/6">What progress has been made on that? This is about a loss of 3% and 10% of business, which are not trivial amounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/7">This will result in not only an economic benefit for Scotland, but in real competition, which will come in two forms: there will be competition for passengers on short-haul flights, for which APD is &#163;13 per passenger, and for those on longer-haul flights, for which it is &#163;71 per passenger. Obviously, the same amount is paid for the return flight. A passenger from Newcastle therefore has an incentive&#8212;this applies to large families in particular&#8212;to travel to Edinburgh or Glasgow in order to save some money. Someone travelling long distance from north America or China has the same incentive.</p>

	<p pid="b.1264.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a knock-on effect on cargo? If the successful flight from Newcastle to Dubai were to be jeopardised in any way, the revenue earned from the airport through the transfer of cargo in that passenger aircraft would also be at risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.1265.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. There is competition not only for passengers, but to get airlines and aircraft to land. Given that a lot of cargo is carried in an aeroplane&#8217;s belly, if Newcastle, Manchester or Leeds Bradford loses a flight to Scotland, it will lose not only the passengers and the benefit they bring but the cargo carried by the plane. The United Kingdom already has experience of that with Belfast airport. The Northern Ireland Assembly managed to get the power to vary APD because it was in competition with Dublin airport, which was taking passengers and aircraft to travel from south of the border. That is well known to people who are interested in transport, but it is less well known that the impact was not only on Belfast, but on English and Welsh airports, as people decided to fly across the Atlantic from Dublin to save the &#163;71.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265.0/2">I will conclude by talking about the economic impact on England. I have given the figures for the savings that passengers could make, and airlines can of course take advantage of those savings by choosing to split them between passengers and their own profit lines. If, however, for the sake of argument, one Ryanair flight and one easyJet flight were moved from Manchester airport to Glasgow, &#163;2.9 million of revenue would be lost to the United Kingdom Treasury and 450 jobs would be lost in Manchester. That is not insignificant when one is trying to build an economy, and I do not blame Edinburgh or Glasgow for trying to build their economy in the way that Newcastle and Manchester are doing. Those figures represent nearly 250,000 passengers, and the economic impact in relation to long-haul flights is much more significant.</p>

	<p pid="b.1265.2/1">I agree with that perfectly sensible point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265.2/2">The Government may have a number of possible solutions, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to respond in some way. Manchester airport has made the case strongly to the Government that there should be an air passenger duty holiday on new long-haul routes, and that would be helpful. The Government could devolve decision making to other parts of the United Kingdom as well as to Scotland, although it would be difficult to find a mechanism for doing so. The Government could also agree to compete with Scotland, because if there is no competition, there will be an unfair loss of jobs through lowering the rate of air passenger duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1265.2/3">Such solutions seem sensible to me, given the experience in the rest of Europe and, indeed, in the rest of the world. The tax was brought in not for environmental reasons, as is sometimes said, but entirely to deal with the hole in the budget after the 1992 general election. It is an inefficient tax: consultants have estimated that it costs the economy more than it brings into the Treasury in cash. Even if the Financial Secretary cannot give an</p>

	<p pid="b.1266.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has been very kind in giving way. The tax is about more than just a hole in the budget; it is actually a demand-management tool for Heathrow and perhaps for Gatwick as well. If airports are full, APD is a demand-management tool that might work. It is certainly not helping in Edinburgh, Glasgow or Manchester. The solution is not to worry about each other, but for us to be rid of it, and for the Government to keep the demand-management tool in airports that are already saturated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266.1/1">I do not agree with the point the hon. Gentleman makes in his fourth intervention. Demand management is not the solution for our regional airports, which have huge extra capacity, but if I went down that line, I expect you would rule me out of order, Mr Crausby. I look forward to the Financial Secretary&#8217;s response.</p>

	<p pid="b.1266.2/1">I will come on to the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10576" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)</phrase> in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/2">The provisions relating to the devolution of air passenger duty&#8212;I will concentrate on the duty, rather than the aggregates levy or the further provisions in clause 18&#8212;were set out clearly in the Smith agreement:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/3">&#8220;86. The power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved&#8230;The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements with regard to the design and collection of any replacement tax, including consideration of the environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/4">&#8220;87. In line with the approach taken in relation to the Scotland Act 2012, if such a tax is introduced by the Scottish Parliament to replace Air Passenger Duty (APD), the Scottish Government will reimburse the UK Government for any costs incurred in &#8216;switching off&#8217; APD in Scotland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/5">Given that they simply would not collect it, I do not imagine those costs would be very high. The provisions also require:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/6">&#8220;88. A fair and equitable share of associated administrative costs will be transferred to the Scottish Government. The&#8230;block grant will be adjusted&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/7">A wide range of organisations that gave evidence to the Scottish Parliament Devolution (Further Powers) Committee backed the devolution of APD, including Institute of Directors Scotland, Glasgow chamber of commerce, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry. As the report says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/8">&#8220;This was coupled with support for either a reduction or scrapping of this duty after devolution had taken place.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/9">The Scottish Parliament Information Centre analysis for the Committee, referred to in the report, found that:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/10">&#8220;Draft clause 14&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/11">now clause 16&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/12">&#8220;would make this a devolved tax, as recommended by the Smith Commission. It would give HMRC the ability to &#8216;switch off&#8217; these UK taxes in Scotland from a date to be set by secondary legislation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/13">As with many of the clauses we have discussed, there is no recommendation as to how the transfer would work or how the block grant would be adjusted, but, as I understand from other clauses, there is no requirement for legislation to achieve that. Essentially, the legislation</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/14">delivers on the Smith agreement in the way anticipated. We have no concerns with the drafting of the clause, which did not change between the Command Paper version and the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/15">In terms of the policy approach on air passenger duty, on which much of this clause stand part debate is centred, the Scottish National party supports the devolution of air passenger duty to the Scottish Parliament. We are pleased that the Scotland Bill will deliver this recommendation. We have previously set out our proposals to halve APD when control over the tax is devolved, and we fully intend to abolish it when public finances allow. We believe that taking that action will encourage greater tourism and investment in Scotland, boosting our economy and creating new jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/16">There are a substantial number of benefits for consumers from the reduction of air passenger duty, not least because the UK levies are some of the highest aviation taxes in the world&#8212;indeed, APD is relatively rare in other countries. APD is currently &#163;71 for an economy class long-haul flight, which is extraordinary&#8212;that is over 2,000 miles. Abolishing APD would mean that a family of four, with children over 12-years-old, would save something under &#163;300 per long-haul flight&#8212;a substantial saving by any measure. Reducing APD would therefore save consumers money, and, in certain circumstances, significantly reduce the cost of family holidays.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/17">There are broader economic benefits from a reduction in air passenger duty. A report commissioned by Edinburgh airport in March 2015 found that a reduction in APD would bring considerable economic benefits to Scotland. The report argued that the Scottish Government&#8217;s policy of halving APD in the first instance would create new jobs, and that a failure to take action would cost Scotland tourists and tourism revenue. Its key findings included the fact that a 50% reduction would provide benefits to Scotland worth &#163;200 million a year, meaning a &#163;1 billion economic boost over the lifetime of a Parliament; and that a 50% reduction would bring considerable benefits to local communities, creating something in the order of 3,800 new jobs by 2020. On the other hand, it was estimated that we could lose out on about 1 million passenger journeys a year if APD was not reduced. Again, by 2020, that would cost the Scottish economy up to &#163;68 million in lost tourism expenditure every year. It is clear, therefore, that devolving and reducing APD would have a considerable economic impact on Scotland and that failure to act would mean Scotland missing out on significant tourism and hospitality revenues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/18">We have heard what happened in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Although the 2014 study by Ulster University was a little more ambivalent and suggested only a limited number of scenarios in which Northern Ireland might benefit, supporters of a reduction pointed to the success of this approach in the Republic of Ireland. As the BBC reported:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/19">&#8220;Tourism NI chairman Howard Hastings said: &#8216;If you compare with our nearest neighbour in the Republic of Ireland, in the two years since they abolished air passenger duty, they've seen arrivals grow by 1.1 million passengers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/20">It is self-evidently a success, and if we can replicate that, we can deliver the benefits I have described. If we do not, we will face the cost of failure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/21">The hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton and others tabled amendments that are not being debated&#8212;although the debate has been very similar to the one I would have heard had we been debating them&#8212;and expressed concern that the devolution of APD to Scotland would disadvantage airports in the north of England, as travellers journey across the border to Scottish airports in order to travel to holiday destinations abroad. The SNP makes no apologies for championing Scotland, and we believe that the reduction and eventual abolition of APD would benefit Scotland&#8217;s economy and tourism sector in particular. Its devolution is also a cross-party commitment agreed through the Smith commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/22">Attracting more tourists to Scottish airports by reducing APD could also benefit the north of England by rebalancing the economy away from London&#8217;s pull and bringing more visitors to the northern parts of these islands as a whole. If one considers Edinburgh to be a hub airport, I am sure that businesses in the north of England would rather spend an hour on the train from Newcastle to Edinburgh than four, five or six hours on the cross-London journey to Heathrow, let alone travelling to a hub airport such as Schiphol or Charles de Gaulle. Edinburgh is the ideal solution for people from Durham, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/23">A stronger Scottish economy will also bring significant economic benefits to the north of England, as new trade and investment opportunities arise. However, we are concerned about some of the UK Government&#8217;s threats in relation to APD&#8212;this relates to what the hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton said about competition. During the election, the Prime Minister astonishingly expressed concerns that a reduction in APD would &#8220;distort competition&#8221;. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/24">&#8220;The SNP government in Scotland is committed to using its new powers to cut and eventually abolish air passenger duty for flights from Scottish airports. That could distort competition and see business drawn north of the border with a huge impact on airports in the rest of our country so we&#8217;re reviewing the way air passenger duty works to make sure other cities don&#8217;t lose out&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/25">Devolving and amending APD is not a distortion of competition; it is competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/26">The Prime Minister&#8217;s comments chimed with his so-called Carlisle principle. It was reported that the Prime Minister had</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/27">&#8220;outlined plans for an annual review of the impact of Scottish Devolution on the rest of the UK. He announced what he&#8217;s calling the &#8216;Carlisle principle&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/28">He did that during a speech in Crewe&#8212;one would think he would go to Carlisle to do it, but Crewe it was. He said that the aim was to make sure that policies devolving more power to Scotland did not have a negative impact on other parts of the UK&#8212;in areas such as air passenger duty, tax rates, university tuition fees or energy policy. If only we had thought of that, we would not have abolished the subsidies for onshore wind.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/29">The Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/30">&#8220;I want to set out a new principle&#8212;you could call it the Carlisle Principle&#8212;that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution, for either England, Wales or Northern Ireland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/31">Will the Minister explain what the Carlisle principle&#8212;whatever it actually is&#8212;will mean in practice for the devolution of APD? I hope that when he gets up, he will say precisely nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1266.2/32">There is agreement on all sides that we have a no detriment and a no advantage principle, which was agreed before the Smith proposals were published. They are clearly being adhered to. There is all-party agreement on the devolution of APD. There can be no backsliding. I suspect there will be no votes on this. I look forward to hearing what the Minister says in his summing up.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/2">I do not oppose the devolution of APD to the Scottish Parliament, but as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10576" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)</phrase> said, it will have a dramatic effect on regional airports within the UK. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11973" name="Stewart Hosie">The hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> mentioned the attractions of Edinburgh to north-east businesses that want international flights, but I have to say that they would sooner fly directly from Newcastle. As for the notion that people would fly to Edinburgh and then get on a train to travel south to our region, that would not be an alternative to flying directly to the north-east via Newcastle. Newcastle airport has been a success story for the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/3">We hear much from this Government about rebalancing the economy. The north-east has taken the brunt when it comes to the loss of public sector jobs and it also has the highest levels of unemployment in the UK. There have also been knock-on effects from the Government&#8217;s decisions deliberately to divert funds from poorer regions such as the north-east to the Tory heartlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/4">We have heard the Government&#8217;s rhetoric about growing the private sector. Newcastle airport has, I think, been a great example. A few years ago, I had the privilege of being a director of the airport, which is great partnership between the local authorities in the region and the private sector. In 2012, the airport added value of some &#163;640 million to the north-east economy, and under its master plan by 20130 it will generate some &#163;1.3 billion for the north-east economy. It is currently sustaining 7,800 jobs, rising to over 10,000 by 2030.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/5">The team at Newcastle airport now provides direct flights to Dubai and to New York, and those international flights will be put at risk if the Scottish Government go ahead with their plans. I understand that this is a devolved matter, and I understand the reasons why the Scottish Government want to reduce APD. Clearly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackley and Broughton said, the tax was brought in for environmental reasons that now make little sense when it comes to growing the country&#8217;s economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269.1/1">I could be reading the amendment paper wrongly, but am I wrong to interpret the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment 36, which has not been called for debate, as designed to delete the clause that would devolve air passenger duty? Several times, the hon. Gentleman said that he was not opposed to the devolution of APD, but I thought his amendment was supposed to delete the provisions that made APD a devolved matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269.2/1">The reason for that is that I was advised to do so to get my probing amendment on the amendment paper. There is no intention to delete the provisions,</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.2/2">and the amendment has not been selected. I would have thought that the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s experience in the House would make him au fait with the procedures for ensuring that Members can get a subject debated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.2/3">The Scottish Government&#8217;s proposals on APD do not make economic sense. Reducing and abolishing APD will clearly grow airport traffic into airports in Scotland as well as grow jobs, yet that will be to the detriment of airports such as Newcastle&#8217;s.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.0/1">If the hon. Gentleman is concerned that further devolution to Scotland might make Scotland too successful, surely the answer is to see further devolution to the regions and great cities of England, not to stop further devolution in its tracks so that everything remains centred in London for ever and a day.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.1/1">I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s thrust, but what the Government have proposed for the north-east is not clear: an elected mayor whose area would stretch from Berwick right down to the Tees. That is the only way we will get any sort of devolution to the north-east at all, and there has been no public debate about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.1/2">Clearly, the measures on air passenger duty will grow jobs in Scottish airports. I accept the point made earlier about the more outlying airports. In this country, we seem to have a policy of looking at regional airports as we do the major city airports. However, it is clear that small airports and communities, whether in Scotland or the rest of the UK, need connectivity to the major hubs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.2/1">Prestwick airport, the oldest passenger airport in Scotland, is in my constituency. We are not even connected to London. There was a time when people could take transatlantic flights from it, but no longer. Rather than thinking that Scotland would steal from the north of England, can the hon. Gentleman not accept that the total number of tourist visitors could grow?</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.3/1">I agree, but if air passenger duty were zero in Scotland and the same as it is now in Newcastle, Scotland would clearly have an advantage. I do not want to get on to how much Scotland is able to devote to its tourism promotion budget, something that we need more of in the north-east.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.4/1">The hon. Gentleman seems to be setting out the most attractive form of tax competition. If Scotland gets rid of air passenger duty, there will be real pressure on the Chancellor to abolish it for the rest of the United Kingdom, and the whole economy will grow. It is marvellous to see the whole House moving in such a right-wing direction in its economic debates.</p>

	<p pid="b.1270.5/1">On this very rare occasion, I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I would abolish APD altogether; it is a tax that, as the Scottish Government have recognised, stifles economic development. A PwC report says that the number of overseas visitors would grow by 7% if we abolished it altogether and that more money would come in from other taxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/2">Scotland, for her own, sensible reasons, could halve and then abolish APD, leaving Newcastle at a great disadvantage. That would cost jobs; it has been anticipated</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/3">that up to 1,000 jobs could be lost by 2025 if the situation remained the same, along with &#163;400 million gross value to the economy of the north-east. One of the poorest regions in the UK cannot afford to be at such a disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/4">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10576" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer)</phrase> said, there seems to be a bit of confusion over the Government&#8217;s approach. He read out the Chancellor&#8217;s comment at the Treasury Committee sitting. The Chancellor seemed to be sanguine, giving the impression that if Scotland reduced its APD, airports such as Newcastle could happily soak up a 10% loss in traffic. I am sorry, but I have been a director of the airport and I know the management team well&#8212;I know how hard they have to work to attract every single flight and new route to Newcastle. A clear 10% loss would not be acceptable. My hon. Friend mentioned another point. The Chancellor also said that his personal view was that tax competition should be allowable. If that means putting the north-east at a disadvantage, the Government have to address that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/5">There has been some confusion. During the general election, the Prime Minister was asked by a local newspaper about unfair competition affecting Newcastle airport and&#8212;we should not forget the other airport in the north-east &#8212;Durham Tees Valley airport. He was questioned about reducing rates of APD for north-east airports to match the reduction in Scotland, as the Labour party in the region had been arguing. He said that that could be a positive suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/6">What we need now is clear action. We have a new Minister for the northern powerhouse, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24930" name="James Wharton">the hon. Member for Stockton South (James Wharton)</phrase>. I understand that his constituency includes Durham Tees Valley, so whether he can persuade the Treasury to do something about the effect of the clause on the north-east economy will be an interesting test of his power. We hear a lot about the northern powerhouse. Those of us in the north-east think that it ends in Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/7">It is important that the effect of the clause is addressed. If it is not, this unfair tax will not only cost jobs in one of the poorest regions of the UK, but stifle one of the few economic drivers in the north-east in Newcastle airport, which can grow not only business, but competition. As I said in an earlier intervention, Newcastle airport is important not only for passengers, but for cargo revenues. It enables companies in the north-east to export around the world. The direct flight to Dubai has meant that a lot of local businesses have been able to export products there directly and to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.5/8">I am interested to know the Government&#8217;s approach to this issue. If the clause is passed, we cannot have a lag that leaves regions such as the north-east being hit by the tax competition which the Chancellor seems to think is acceptable, but which the Prime Minister clearly wants to do something about. The ball is firmly in the Government&#8217;s court to ensure that this anomaly is put right.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Members for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) and for North Durham (Mr Jones) for the way that they have spoken about this issue. I am unconvinced by the argument</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.0/2">that they had to table an amendment to delete the devolution of air passenger duty in order to make speeches. Speeches could be made on clause stand part. None the less, whatever the flow of logic, I am delighted that they have confirmed that they support the devolution of APD. I will be very supportive, in return, of some of the arguments that they have made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.0/3">As I have been through this issue in one guise or another over the past few years, I thought that it might be useful to remind the Committee of a little bit of history. The devolution of APD was proposed by the Calman commission. For Members who were not in the House at that time or who are not fully up on these matters, the Calman commission was the response of the Unionist parties to the SNP&#8217;s breakthrough in the 2007 election. We are still debating the devolution of APD because it disappeared from the legislative programme arising from Calman that was enacted in the last Parliament. It was proposed again by the Smith commission, which was the response of the Unionist parties, through the vow, to try to deflect the yes campaign in the final days of last year&#8217;s referendum.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.0/4">Both those events, incidentally, have been overtaken by the fact that 56 Members of Parliament now adorn these Benches for the Scottish National party. No doubt, at some occasion in the not too distant future, we will be back debating the Government&#8217;s response to that latest political development. Surely history tells us&#8212;the hon. Member for Blackley and Broughton referred to this&#8212;that it would have been far better to have been more extensive and generous with devolution in the first place, and that we should not repeat the mistakes that the Government and the Unionist parties made in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.0/5">I had a meeting with Howard Davies a few years back when he was asked to chair the Airports Commission. I will be generous and say that it was set up to address the under-capacity and congestion at airports in the south-east of England&#8212;or perhaps it was to bash Boris&#8217;s proposal for an island airport. The point was to reconcile between Heathrow and Gatwick. We can be absolutely certain about two things in respect of the proposals that will come from the Howard Davies commission. First, we can be certain that, whatever the final adjudication, it will be some considerable time before either Heathrow or Gatwick emerges as the winner from the process. Secondly, we can be certain that, whatever emerges from the process, considerable amounts of public money, running into many billions of pounds, will be devoted, by one means or another, to expanding the capacity of those airports, which are severely congested at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.0/6">The reason I mention this is that when I had my meeting, as First Minister, with Mr Davies&#8212;it might be Sir Howard Davies now, for all I know&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am told that he is soon to be ennobled&#8212;other people have more information on these things than I do. Anyway, when I had my meeting with Sir Howard, I said, &#8220;Given that, whatever happens, your proposals will take some time to be enacted, would it not be a grand idea for you to propose, in the meantime, measures to relieve some of the congestion in the south of England airports? Perhaps reducing air passenger duty in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England and, pro tem at least, diverting some of the business from those airports would relieve some of the extraordinary pressure on them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.0/7">I was very disappointed when, in his interim report, Sir Howard made clear his belief that such a move would constitute a &#8220;distortion of competition&#8221;. I thought that that was a magnificent argument in its way&#8212;magnificent in terms of brass neck. It was clearly not a distortion of competition to propose the expenditure of billions of pounds of public money on investment&#8212;financed by all of us&#8212;in increasing the capacity of the south of England airports, but it somehow would be a distortion of competition to reduce the taxation and increase the revenues generated by airports in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273.1/1">I do agree with that, but I also think that we must consider the motivation for the introduction of what appears to be a remarkably foolish tax. Any Chancellor looking at Heathrow, for example, would see a fully congested airport and an air passenger duty with an effective collection rate of 100%, whereas any Chancellor looking at the north of England, Northern Ireland or Scotland would see airports with substantial capacity where a reduction in APD could increase business, and, given increased revenues from VAT and other taxation, would see the magic formula for a Laffer curve emerging. I was going to turn to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24926" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon.

According to a recent study of transport infrastructure spending per head in various parts of England, the figure for the south-east of England was over &#163;2,000 per head, the figure for the north-east was &#163;26 per head, and the figure for the north-west was &#163;200 per head.

	<p pid="b.1274.1/2">I am delighted that Members from the north of England have accepted that this tax should be devolved, and I am delighted that they have accepted the economic argument behind the direction in which the Scottish Government are moving. I think that the tax should be reduced at airports in the north of England as well, because they have substantial capacity that would increase revenue for us all. I am glad that their amendment did not become the basis of this conversation, because if the Scottish Government had opposed the devolution of part of APD to Northern Ireland, no progress would have been made. We are now on the verge of having APD devolved to Scotland, and I say to Members representing north of England constituencies that they should take the attitude that this should be the example for further devolution of a sensible policy which not only benefits one part of the country but looks at the economic opportunities in all parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1274.1/3">Unfortunately, I arrived for this debate at the end of the VAT fiddle discussion. I hope when the Minister replies on APD that, instead of his wholly disappointing and negative attitude to the embezzlement of VAT from the Scottish police service, he will return to the style of grace and imagination with which he usually so adorns the Dispatch Box, and this time recognise the opportunity for Scotland, and indeed the north of England, of making sure that this disgraceful tax is reduced and economic activity is increased.</p>

	<p pid="b.1275.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman will know that the whole history of airline travel hitherto has been that it increases exponentially. It has done so, and if allowed to do so, will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.4/2">So I do not share this cosy consensus. I am not part of the airline and airport love-ins. As Members will know, airlines and their passengers already get a huge subsidy because of the low price they pay for airline fuel&#8212;kerosene. Members ought to bear this in mind when debating APD: no doubt the figures are lower in Scotland, but across the UK in any given year half the population do not fly. I believe that hon. Members have a completely distorted view of this matter. I suspect that I am one of the very few Members of this House who does not fly; I have not flown for years. I suspect that every other Member has a distorted view, based on self-interest. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is not me who is causing a huge amount of environmental degradation through flying. The greenhouse gases emitted by aeroplanes at high altitude are far more damaging than the same amount of greenhouse gases emitted at sea level. Air travel is the most polluting form of mass travel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.4/3">In that context, I regret that the Government are devolving air passenger duty. Yes, I would increase it. The UK Government will live to regret this measure, because we are clearly heading towards the abolition of air passenger duty in Scotland and, eventually, through a process of &#8220;beggar my neighbour&#8221; downwards, across the rest of the United Kingdom. That will be another nail in the coffin of the doomed and uneconomic HS2 railway line. People will continue to fly south from Scotland and the north of England, and vice versa, rather than using the HS2 line. It is already uneconomic and, with the abolition of air passenger duty, it will become even more so.</p>

The issue has been raised directly by the Committee on Climate Change, which reported recently that Scotland had missed its climate change target by 4.5%, the third time in a row that it had missed an annual target. The report also asked the Scottish Government to assess the impact of carbon on the economy in relation to the slashing of air passenger duty. I cannot ask the Scottish Government this question directly from the Dispatch Box, but can the Minister tell me whether an environmental assessment has been carried out on the raising or lowering of the duty?</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.2/1">Again, the hon. Gentleman is making a particular case. There are particular circumstances applying to that flight to the US, especially the competition that existed from the Republic of Ireland, which was why steps were taken on that point.

	<p pid="b.1277.3/1">Is the Minister telling the House tonight that the Chancellor has changed his views? When he went before the Treasury Committee last year, he talked about the effects on Newcastle, which he said would be about 10%. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.3/2">&#8220;That was work carried out a couple of years ago, but in Newcastle&#8217;s case, its traffic was up 12% last year, so I think these are manageable.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.3/3">Is the Minister now giving a commitment that this will be looked at or is the Chancellor sticking to his position that a reduction of 10% would be acceptable and &#8220;manageable&#8221; for Newcastle?</p>

	<p pid="b.1278.2/1">I should put it as neutrally as I possibly can. We do not believe that the behavioural effects are as great as those set out in the PwC report, which is why we believe APD does raise revenue.

Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray)</phrase> asked about the likely progress on legal matters. The European Commission was forced to reconsider its 2002 decision that the exemptions from the levy did not provide state aid following legal action by the British Aggregates Association. It announced its decision in March, finding that the levy as a whole was lawful, as were most of the exemptions. The Government are currently informally consulting trade associations on draft legislation to reinstate those exemptions&#8212;for example on slate and clay&#8212;found lawful by the Commission in March 2015.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.1/1">With this it will be convenient to discuss the following:</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.1/3">&#8216;(1) Part 2 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 (specific reservations) is amended as follows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279.1/4">(2) In Section A1 (fiscal, economic and monetary policy)&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.1/8" class="italic">This New Clause would provide for the creation of a Scottish Office for Budget Responsibility to exercise fiscal and budgetary oversight over Scottish Government competencies. The Smith Commission recommended that the Scottish Parliament should seek to expand and strengthen the independent scrutiny of Scotland&#8217;s public finances in recognition of the additional variability and uncertainty that further tax and spending devolution will introduce into the budgeting process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.1/10">Individual local authorities in Scotland shall have the discretion to raise additional income by levying a tax, in addition to Council Tax and Non-Domestic Rates, on either residents, occupiers, property owners or visitors in the local authority or within a discrete area of the local authority.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.1/26">(4) Subject to subsection (5), the commission may determine its own quorum and methods of working and must publish a protocol setting out its own terms of reference.</p>

	<p pid="b.1281.0/1">It is great to see you in the Chair, Ms Engel. Congratulations on your elevation to Deputy Speaker. It appears that in tonight&#8217;s debate there is a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu, as we debated full fiscal autonomy a few weeks ago. Given that the Committee stage of this Bill has been dominated by the SNP manifesto commitment to deliver full fiscal autonomy and bringing forward its watered down promise to deliver it this year, it is good that we have the opportunity to try to put it into this Bill. In fact, as we witnessed last week, the SNP&#8217;s hand had to be forced by its arch Thatcherite colleagues, when its Members went into the Lobby with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase>. I said at the time that the worst possible scenario for Scotland would be the SNP demanding full fiscal autonomy and its being delivered by a majority Conservative Government. Those words were echoed&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1281.2/2">&#8220;An incoming Tory government faced with a big number of SNP MPs, saying, &#8216;OK, if that&#8217;s what Scotland voted for, let&#8217;s give them Full Fiscal Autonomy.&#8217; The Treasury would be able to dump &#163;7.5bn of the deficit on the Scottish Government and just walk away.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1281.2/3">The fact that the SNP has another fudged amendment this evening shows that it does not believe that full fiscal autonomy would be good for Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.1282.7/1">I am delighted by that intervention. What I did not want to do last week was rain on the parade of the Scottish National party as its Members went through the Lobby with the Thatcherite Conservatives to deliver full fiscal autonomy for Scotland. That is what seems to be wrong. The SNP is in full agreement with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352" name="Edward Leigh">the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> again tonight on the subject of the devolution of the entirety of income tax. Perhaps the party has a right-wing agenda after all.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.7/2">As we know, the Bill provides full control of nearly 50% of revenues and more than 60% of spending. According to the Library, that will be 65% if the devolution of housing benefit is agreed tomorrow, making it one of the most powerful devolved Parliaments in the world. The OECD ranked the Smith proposals and came to the same conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.7/3">With that accountability and responsibility must come transparency and honesty. During the general election campaign, the First Minister and SNP candidates repeatedly said that they would vote for full fiscal autonomy this</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.7/4">year. That was reaffirmed in the television debates. All the impartial and independent expert analysis of full fiscal autonomy shows clearly that that would devastate Scotland&#8217;s financial position. That is the genesis of our new clause 1. If the Scottish Government want to dismiss all the independent experts simply because they do not agree with them, let us set up an independent commission to consider the consequences on Scotland&#8217;s finances of full fiscal autonomy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1283.1/1">The new clause is quite clear. I do not think it would be appropriate for Members of the House of Lords to serve on the commission&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Will SNP Members let me finish the sentence before they start braying from the Back Benches again?</p>

	<p pid="b.1283.4/1">The problem with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond)</phrase> is that he does not want to debate full fiscal autonomy, as he knows that it is a bad policy. Let me emphasise that if the Secretary of State wants to accept the new clause, I would be more than happy to ensure that Members of the House of Lords were not on the commission. Let us be transparent and accountable in this place, rather than nitpicking about parts of the clause. The SNP do not want the scrutiny and that is the key to this argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.4/2">Let us consider some of that scrutiny. The much-quoted IFS analysed full fiscal autonomy in Scotland and said that it would cost &#163;7.6 billion next year and up to &#163;10 billion by 2020. It has made it clear that that is over and above the deficit of the UK at the moment and the spending profile of the current Conservative Government. Let me emphasise again, as this has been misquoted by</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.4/3"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11189" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase> on a number of occasions, that that figure is in addition to the current UK deficit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.4/4">The impartial analysis has been dismissed by the Scottish Government, so let us turn to another source of information, Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury, which analysed these figures with results broadly in line with the analysis of the IFS. According to Treasury costings that I obtained through a freedom of information request, full fiscal autonomy would leave Scotland with an additional cash terms deficit of &#163;7.7 billion in 2015-16, rising to &#163;8.4 billion in 2019-20.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.4/5">Again, this will no doubt be dismissed, so let us look at the Office for Budget Responsibility oil and gas report published just 10 days ago. It shows that revenue from the North sea is projected to fall from &#163;36.7 billion to just &#163;2 billion in the period 2020-40. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That is dismissed not just by the SNP, but at this moment by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11333" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, so let us try the Scottish Government&#8217;s own annual accounts in the form of the Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report published in March this year. The Scottish Government&#8217;s annual accounts show an annual deficit over and above the UK deficit of some &#163;4 billion, and projections are due to worsen with the lower oil price.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that between 2007 and 2009 the UK&#8217;s deficit quadrupled. Given the significance that he attaches to deficits and to one year, what significance does he attach to the quadrupling of the debt of a state in a two-year period?</p>

	<p pid="b.1284.1/1">I am not sure I understand the intervention. We are debating a deficit in Scotland being &#163;7.6 billion over and above any UK deficit, rising to &#163;10 billion by 2020. If we are defending Scottish jobs and livelihoods, that seems not just economically incredible, but economic illiteracy. Hon. Members need not take my word for it. The Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary, Grahame Smith, commented that the Scottish Government&#8217;s own accounts were</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/2">&#8220;a sobering reminder of some of the risks of full fiscal autonomy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/3">That is from the trade unions in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/4">The Scottish Government sneaked out their own oil and gas bulletin, their first since May 2014, last week on the last day of the Scottish Parliament. It would be good to look at that alongside the independence White Paper. The bulletin was very much in accord with the Office for Budget Responsibility that was rubbished just a few days before. It showed that North sea oil revenues and projections have fallen drastically in recent times, so let us have a look at those figures. The Scottish Government&#8217;s own oil and gas bulletin of June 2015 estimated North sea tax receipts for the period 2016-20 to be &#163;5.8 billion. The same scenario from the same bulletin 13 months earlier estimated the receipts to be well in excess of &#163;26 billion. Even if we compare one year&#8212;say, 2016-17&#8212;revenues had fallen from a projected &#163;6.9 billion to &#163;1.1 billion, and the lower estimates are as low as &#163;500 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/5">These are the Scottish Government&#8217;s own figures&#8212;all in all, an 85% drop. That tells us two things. First, it blows apart the financial basis for full fiscal autonomy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/6">Secondly, like my new clauses 1 and 21, it calls for a more robust and impartial analysis of the Scottish economy and public finances. That is why we tabled new clauses 1 and 21. New clause 21, alongside new clause 1, would provide for the creation of a Scottish office for budget responsibility to exercise independent and impartial fiscal and budget oversight over Scottish Government devolved competencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/7">The Smith commission recommended that</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/8">&#8220;the Scottish Parliament should seek to expand and strengthen the independent scrutiny of Scotland&#8217;s public finances in recognition of the additional variability and uncertainty that further tax and spending devolution will introduce into the budgeting process.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/9">The new clauses would do just that and take away the politicisation of one of the fundamental underpinnings of the Scottish economy, the financing of Scottish public services and, crucially, though it tends to be forgotten in this debate, the livelihoods of everyone living and working in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/10">I would go further and ensure that the Scottish office for budget responsibility assesses and reports on individual party manifestos, so that the public can be confident that what they are being sold is both credible and desirable. This is about simple transparency and accountability. That transparency and accountability, as I have said, has not been forthcoming on the current manifesto commitment on full fiscal autonomy. If we had had a Scottish office for budget responsibility at the last election, it would have reported that FFA would be hugely disadvantageous to Scotland. It would have backed up the IFS analysis that showed that FFA did not work and that Scotland would need a real-terms growth rate of 4.5% per year at least between 2013-14 and 2019-20. The assistant general secretary of the STUC, Mr Stephen Boyd, commented exactly on this and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/11">&#8220;The implication across the board is that taxes would be cut. There are a number of examples where the Scottish Government would be trading a real and immediate cut in revenue for benefits that may not be great in the long run.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/12">That shows that it would not be achievable in the figures from the IFS. The IFS&#8217;s conclusion is that FFA would incur deep, deep cuts in spending or huge tax rises.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/13">It is easy to talk about figures, percentages and statistics, but this has to be about the everyday lives of ordinary, hard-working Scottish families. Inflicting a policy on Scotland that would leave a deficit larger than the entire education budget, or more than three quarters the size of the NHS budget, will not assist Scotland. We all reject the Conservative Government&#8217;s misguided austerity, which we know is ideologically driven, rather than an attempt to balance the country&#8217;s finances, but we must also reject any policy that would inflict harsher and deeper austerity in Scotland. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> This is not, as some would claim&#8212;they are claiming it as I speak&#8212;about being anti-Scottish, anti-aspiration or anti-hope for the ingenuity, passion and entrepreneurial spirit of Scotland; it is a sobering response to a key manifesto commitment from the Scottish National party.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/14">SNP Members dismiss the views of the IFS, the OBR and even their own GERS reports, but even Jonathan Portes, the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, has said on FFA:</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/15">&#8220;If the SNP plan for full fiscal autonomy were to go ahead, then, as a number of commentators have said, that would lead to very, very severe austerity in Scotland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.1/16">That is why Labour is against full fiscal autonomy; that is why we believe in the pooling and sharing of resources across the United Kingdom; and that is why the public voted to remain part of the United Kingdom.</p>

If Members read new clause 1 and new clause 21, they will see very clearly that what we are asking for is an independent commission to analyse the consequences for Scotland of full fiscal autonomy. If the SNP is so confident about its figures, it should back that proposal and then we will have the transparency, impartiality and independence of those policies. If it is so confident that it was not fiddling the figures, it should help us to set up a Scottish office for budget responsibility and let that body analyse its figures. However, it is clear once again that, when we shine the light of scrutiny on SNP policies, its Members want to talk about the process but not look at the impartial and independent evidence before us. If they are so confident, they will back new clause 1 and new clause 21 and bring much needed transparency, credibility and accountability back to the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s finances.</p>

	<p pid="b.1286.2/1">We have just listened to one of the worst speeches I have heard in 10 years. The Labour party now has one argument: we have gone from being too small, too poor and too stupid for independence to being too small, too poor and too stupid for any powers at all. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24872" name="Ian Murray">The hon. Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray)</phrase> spoke about something that was &#8220;credible&#8221;. Credible? The Scottish people decided what was credible at the election in May, and they did not say it was his party. He spoke about right-wing, Thatcherite Tories, but it sounds to me like the core vote of the only Labour MP left in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286.2/2">New clause 33, which stands in my name and those of my hon. Friends, would require the Scottish and UK Governments to enter into an economic agreement setting out a plan for implementation of full fiscal autonomy for Scotland and establishing a framework within which the two Governments co-ordinate their economic and fiscal policies in the context of full fiscal autonomy for Scotland. The Scottish Parliament and Government would have competence for revenue raised in Scotland through taxation and borrowing and for determining levels of public expenditure in or as regards Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286.2/3">We see the framework including arrangements for facilitating fiscal co-ordination, overseeing economic co-operation, safeguarding fiscal sustainability, and setting out the joint responsibilities in certain areas. In the agreement, the two Governments must seek to ensure the maintenance of monetary stability throughout the UK and the single market of the UK and the EU. They must also ensure co-operation in the exercise of all the respective functions relating to the administration and collection of taxes and an equitable and transparent approach to the consequences, resources and rewards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286.2/4">The Scottish Parliament and Government would retain the benefits of increased tax revenues as a result of positive policy impacts and would have the powers they need to manage the consequences of full fiscal autonomy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286.2/5">I turn briefly to new clauses 1 and 21. New clause 1 would require that a Tory Secretary of State appoint a commission of between four and 11 members, none of whom can be Members of Parliament, Members of the Scottish Parliament or employees thereof. It is backed by Labour and United Kingdom Independence party Members, so we have a Labour amendment backed by UKIP asking a Tory Secretary of State&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1287.3/1">So we have confirmation&#8212;Labour and UKIP hand in hand, empowering the Tories to run the rule over Scotland again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.3/2">As for new clause 21 on a Scottish OBR, we already have one&#8212;it is called the Scottish Fiscal Commission. The consultation on its expanded power closed on Friday. One would have thought that Scotland&#8217;s sole Labour MP might actually have known what was going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.3/3">New clause 33 would have the Scottish and UK Governments enter into an economic agreement that set up a plan for the implementation of full fiscal autonomy and establish a framework within which the two Governments would co-ordinate their economic and fiscal policies in the context of full fiscal autonomy. That would mean the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government having competence for determining revenues raised in Scotland through taxation and borrowing, and for all of the spending, paying compensation to the UK for shared services. This is the right approach to take. I am just disappointed that we did not have proper time to debate it rather than being subject to the nonsensical rant and talking Scotland down by the so-called shadow Secretary of State. By taking responsibility for key areas of Scottish life, we can improve the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s ability to deliver real progress for the Scottish people. New clause 33 does that. It rejects the miserablist approach of the Labour party, and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> set out the facts, and the facts are clear&#8212;a &#163;10 billion black hole for Scottish taxpayers to fill. We do not need a commission to tell us that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.4/2">I do not accept the new clause on a Scottish OBR, because one thing that the hon. Gentleman said is correct&#8212;it is for the Scottish Government to determine</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.4/3">for the people of Scotland how they will ensure independent oversight of fiscal policy. The UK Government would like legislation brought forward by the Scottish Government to be consistent with OECD principles for best practice in independent fiscal institutions. We therefore look to have those discussions during the negotiation of the fiscal framework.</p>

	<p pid="b.1305.1/1">I wish to present a petition on behalf of my constituents in the Cynon Valley, my hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Gerald Jones) and for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock), and people from all parts of Wales. On the instruction of Mrs Beryl Astbury and Mrs Pamela Lewis, descendants of Mr Richard Lewis, their solicitor Bernard de Maid has written to the Secretary of State for Justice requesting a pardon for Richard Lewis. I repeat Richard Lewis&#8217;s last words before his hanging on <phrase class="date" code="1831-08-13">13 August 1831</phrase>, which reaffirm this miscarriage of justice: &#8220;O Arglwydd, dyma gamwedd.&#8221; In English, this means, &#8220;Oh Lord, this is injustice.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.1/2">The petition states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.1/3">The Petition of residents of Wales,</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.1/4">Declares that Richard Lewis (known as Dic Penderyn) was a Welsh labourer and coal miner who lived in Merthyr Tydfil; further that he was involved with the Merthyr Rising of <phrase class="date" code="1831-06-03">3 June 1831</phrase>; further that during the riot, he was arrested and charged with stabbing a soldier, Donald Black, with a bayonet; further that the people of Merthyr Tydfil were convinced of his innocence and signed a petition for his release; further that despite this, he was found guilty and hanged on <phrase class="date" code="2015-08-13">13 August</phrase>; further that in 1874, a man named Ianto Parker confessed on his death bed that he stabbed Donald Black; further that James Abbott, who testified against Richard Lewis at the trial later admitted to lying under oath; further that at Mr Lewis&#8217; trial, the Prosecution suppressed evidence which would have exonerated him; further that the same evidence, which should have led to his pardon in 1831, was also suppressed by the trial Judge and the Home Secretary; further that there is strong feeling in Wales that Richard Lewis was wrongly executed, that his conviction should be overturned and that he should be granted a pardon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.1/5">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Secretary of State for Justice to grant a pardon to Richard Lewis.</p>
	<p pid="b.1305.1/6">And the Petitioners remain, etc.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306.2/1">I pay tribute to the work carried out on this issue by James Arbuthnot, the former Member for North East Hampshire, and Mike Wood, the former Member for Batley and Spen, both of whom I worked with for more than two years in a working party in search of a fair settlement on this matter. Unfortunately, throughout the process we all lost faith and trust in the Post Office&#8217;s willingness to investigate the issue properly and thoroughly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.2/2">To give some background on how the Post Office has let down sub-postmasters and Members of this House throughout this process, let us consider how it has dealt with the matter from the outset. The Horizon accounting system used by sub-postmasters was introduced some 15 years ago. Almost immediately, a spate of discrepancies began to appear as sub-postmasters attempted to balance their accounts at the end of the day. From that time forward, there has been failing after failing on the part of the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.2/3">The Post Office has finally acknowledged that its help system for the Horizon software was completely inadequate, but even with that admission the Post Office continues in its failure to demonstrate any appetite to deal with issues arising from the Horizon system in a fair and transparent way.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306.3/1">Is there not something disgraceful in the fact that criminal charges were pressed against these sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses when the fault lay with the Post Office, yet nearly two years after the investigations those charges have not been lifted? The shadow hanging over their heads has not been lifted either. Does the hon. Gentleman not feel that it is time to bring that to an end?</p>

	<p pid="b.1306.4/1">The hon. Gentleman tells a tale which has been told too long to the working group. We need to bring matters to a head and I hope the debate tonight will give us an opportunity to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.4/2">The mediation scheme that was set up to handle disputes about the software system has not delivered what Members of this House had understood was agreed at its inception. It was flawed in a number of ways, the most significant being that it excluded those who had pleaded guilty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306.5/1">My constituent, Jo Hamilton, has her case in front of the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Does my hon. Friend agree that for those who pleaded guilty, the CCRC should be given powers to obtain all the papers that it needs from private sector organisations and full access to all Post Office files?</p>

	<p pid="b.1306.6/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point and he is right. Many people pleaded guilty on advice from lawyers or out of fear of losing their liberty in a lengthy and expensive court battle with the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.6/2">The House should know that the Horizon system has no adequate suspense account function, so it pushes the sub-postmaster who wants to balance his books when the books actually do not balance. This is false accounting and a criminal offence. However, I have seen correspondence that shows that the Post Office has advised sub-postmasters to keep any surplus balances that they discover at the close of business in their safe so that they can put them back when they have a shortage. That is also false accounting and is also a criminal offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.6/3">A further flaw is the fact that issues of concern to the forensic accountants Second Sight, appointed by the Post Office at the request of the working group to assess independently the mediation cases, have been specifically excluded from mediation&#8212;for example, the absence or the ignorance on the part of the sub-postmaster of the contract they were under, and the failure of audits and investigation&#8212;despite the agreement of Post Office Ltd with Members of this House that the scheme would cover all these issues. This is resulting in what I believe to be 90% of the cases in dispute being excluded from the mediation scheme. This mediation has proven to be a shadow of what was agreed with Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.6/4">I first became involved in this matter several years ago when my constituent Michael Rudkin brought his case to me. My constituent had 15 years&#8217; experience as a postmaster and served as a senior member of the national executive. Indeed, he was chairman of the negotiating committee, the most senior post within the National Federation of SubPostmasters, responsible for national negotiations with Post Office Ltd and Royal Mail Group. In short, my constituent knew his job and the organisation inside out. He knew the organisation to the extent that on a visit to the Post Office headquarters in Bracknell, he was shown in error a room where operatives had remote access to the Horizon software and it was demonstrated to him how postmasters&#8217; accounts could be altered remotely. The House should know that the Post Office has always maintained that it is not possible to alter accounts in a sub-post office remotely. However, it has recently admitted that this was not the truth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.6/5">In a debate in December I went into the details of Mr Rudkin&#8217;s case. To summarise, his post office branch had a loss in the accounts in excess of &#163;44,000. He was absolved of any knowledge of this loss by Post Office Ltd but ordered to pay back the money at &#163;1,000 per month from his salary. After he had paid back &#163;13,000, Post Office Ltd started proceedings against Mr Rudkin&#8217;s wife for theft and false accounting. It also applied for a confiscation order to be placed on all his property and had his bank accounts frozen using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. This all occurred after my constituent had witnessed the operatives in Post Office headquarters demonstrating their remote access to the Horizon system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.6/6">My constituent has gone through the mediation scheme and his experience is that the professional advisers, Aver Ltd, Bill Cleghorn and Emma Porter, are very good. Second Sight has been extremely fair, professional and accurate in its analysis of both systemic and thematic issues within Post Office Ltd. However, the same cannot be said of the Post Office itself. I and my constituent have no faith in its ability to resolve the matter. It is said that justice delayed is justice denied, and this matter has</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.6/7">simply dragged on for too long, with the Post Office seemingly looking for ever more reasons to delay the truth of the matter coming out.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.0/1">In the past five days I have been alerted to a case in my constituency. Very briefly, the sub-postmistress emailed me to say:</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.0/3">That has left the village without a post office service, and obviously it is also putting an intolerable strain on my constituent. I would be grateful if my hon. Friend and the Minister would consider the impact that that is having.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. When we hear a Post Office spokesperson stating,</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.1/2">&#8220;I am really sorry if people have faced lifestyle problems as a result of their having been working in Post Office branches&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.1/3">we have to wonder whether the organisation is even aware of the misery it has caused. The fact that Post Office Ltd believes that honest, decent, hard-working people losing their homes, their businesses, their savings, their reputation and, worst of all, in some cases their liberty can be quantified as a &#8220;lifestyle change&#8221; only serves to show that the organisation is not fit to conduct an inquiry into the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.1/4">The Post Office mediation scheme has proven to be a sham, Second Sight has proven to be far too independent for the Post Office to stand, and the disdain that has been shown to Members of this House and to sub-postmasters is a disgrace.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.3/1">Indeed. When we look at the cross-section of Members who have raised the matter, many of whom have served at the highest levels of Government, and who all believe that their constituents have been wronged, how can the Post Office believe that it can continue to sweep the matter under the carpet?</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.3/2">It is most interesting that after two years in which the Post Office has consistently claimed that its Horizon system software is robust and 100% reliable, I now have in my position an email clearly showing that the Post Office is now urgently seeking a replacement software system from IBM. I am sure that the Minister can draw his own conclusion from the happy coincidence that the investigation is now closed. It appears to me that it is indeed now sunset for the Horizon system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.3/3">It is therefore my belief, and the view of many Members across the House, that the matter must now be taken away from the Post Office and a judicial inquiry set up. The Post Office has abused its privileged position and sought to cover up its failings by way of a wholly non-transparent approach to the mediation process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1309.1/1">I am not surprised to hear that from the hon. Gentleman. The management style of the senior management at the Post Office is Dickensian, and they have an almost feudal relationship with their sub-postmasters. This is now a national scandal. The Post Office has demonstrated that it is incapable of putting its own house in order, so it falls to this House and to this Government to do so for it. I therefore respectfully ask the Minister for a full judicial review into the Post Office Horizon system and the way in which the Post Office contracts with is sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1309.2/2">My constituent Tom Brown, a postmaster for 30 years, had a post office in Newcastle. In 2008, he informed the Post Office that there was a problem with his Horizon system, and it took away one of his base units to change it. He was told by the helpline&#8212;a euphemism because it has not been very helpful to many sub-postmistresses and sub-postmasters and has actually got them into more trouble&#8212;that the system would rectify itself. It did not. The next audit said that his figures were down by &#163;85,000. He was arrested by Northumbria police, and his car and home were searched. Subsequently, the police dropped all charges as there was no evidence against him. Then, for some unknown reason, the Post Office took out a prosecution against him to take him to court for false accounting. That process took until July 2013, when he finally appeared in court for the third time. No evidence was put forward to the court, and after that the case was dropped.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.2/3">This man has lost his home, his livelihood and his good reputation. He is one of the individuals who have gone through the mediation system, even though, as the hon. Gentleman outlined, the system is a sham. He was given four different dates that were all delayed. He described this to me as six hours of wasted time. The Post Office employed top lawyers from Newcastle to represent it. It again went through what it said was the evidence, and made no offer at all. The system is a sham. As the hon. Gentleman outlined, it has been a way of delaying decisions on these cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.1309.3/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the Post Office has failed to be transparent about this process? My constituent, Mrs Carter, a sub-postmistress, asked the Post Office to audit her branch to get to the bottom of the problem, but it refused to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.1309.4/1">I will go further than that. It has not only not been transparent; it has gone out of its way to delay cases and hide evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.4/2">My concern about the work done by Second Sight is that it suggests that if information is returned to the Post Office, evidence will go missing. That is why I totally agree with the hon. Member for North West Leicestershire that there needs to be an independent judicial inquiry into this&#8212;as he described it&#8212;national scandal. I am pleased that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11362" name="Iain Wright">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase>, the new Chair of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, is present for this debate. I urge him and his Committee to look at this as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.4/3">The fundamental point is this: who controls the Post Office? This organisation is out of control. It has led to people&#8217;s lives being ruined and, as we have heard, in some cases to people being given prison sentences when clearly they are innocent. It is important that we get to the bottom of this. Without a judicial inquiry, I fear that this national scandal will continue and these people&#8217;s reputations will continue to be blackened.</p>

	<p pid="b.1310.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24741" name="Andrew Bridgen">the Member for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen)</phrase> on securing this debate. I commend him and other hon. Members across the House for raising here and elsewhere the concerns of their constituents&#8212;sub-postmasters who face problems. I echo the tributes paid to the former Members for North East Hampshire and for Batley and Spen for their work on this issue. They, my hon. Friend and others can take a great deal of credit for raising this issue and encouraging the Post Office to take action to address sub-postmasters&#8217; concerns and to improve business for the thousands of sub-postmasters and staff working in the network today. My hon. Friend kindly informed me before the debate of the points he wanted to raise, and I will try to deal with all his questions, but I want first to set out a little background.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.0/2">Hon. Members do not need me to wax lyrical about the important role that post offices play in communities in providing access to essential mail, financial and Government services. I am sure that we all agree on and understand that. The Post Office is undergoing a very significant transformation programme to remove central costs, grow new revenue streams and modernise its extensive branch network. Already, more than half of eligible sub-postmasters have benefited from investment in their branches or have signed up to do so. These changes will help the post office network to survive in the digital age. The way we live and communicate is changing, and post offices need to adapt to that. The Government are supporting and investing in the Post Office to ensure that it can become sustainable for the long term and reduce its reliance on taxpayer subsidy. The network is now at its most stable for a generation. Having halted the closure programmes we saw under previous Governments, we are committed to securing the future of 3,000 branches that are the last shop in a local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.0/3">The Government are, of course, the shareholder of Post Office Ltd, and in that role we make sure that there is a wide network of branches across the whole country, and we provide subsidy for the Post Office to do so. We also recognise, however, that it is a commercial business</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.0/4">and we allow it to operate as such. Furthermore, as I am sure most hon. Members are aware, the vast majority of post office branches are operated not by Post Office Ltd, but by sub-postmasters. They are independent businesspeople who choose to contract with Post Office Ltd to provide post office services, usually from a small business such as a shop.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.0/5">Small businesses are the lifeblood of the local economy in so many communities, and Post Office Ltd needs to ensure that it supports its sub-postmasters properly. I am pleased that the Post Office takes that role very seriously and that it has made significant improvements to the way in which it works with its sub-postmasters, not least following many of the cases that hon. Members have raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1310.0/6">The Post Office already ensures that new sub-postmasters receive full training on all aspects of their role, including the Horizon system, through both classroom and in-branch training. There is also a dedicated helpline available to sub-postmasters to help resolve any issues they are having.</p>

	<p pid="b.1311.0/1">I am listening carefully to the Minister, but surely he accepts that there is a fundamental problem with the Horizon system, because we have heard complaints right across the country from all sections of the population, as well as from the sub-postmasters themselves.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-29b.1311.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24817" speakername="George Freeman" colnum="1311"  time="023:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150629/debtext/150629-0005.htm#150629-0005.htm_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.1311.1/1">I will come to the quality of the system. It is difficult on the face of it to characterise either the training or the helpline as having been inadequate. The vast majority of people who use or have used the Horizon system since it was introduced 15 years ago have in fact done so successfully. However, there is always room for improvement and the Post Office has implemented a business support programme to that end, including improvements to training, with both classroom and new online training available 24/7; improvements to the Post Office&#8217;s support helpline, including new ways of identifying and proactively supporting branches in difficulty; and new processes to help sub-postmasters manage their branch and protect against fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/2">I now come to some of the points that have been made about the Horizon IT system. It is used by tens of thousands of people working in the post office network, performing more than 6 million transactions every working day in branches up and down the country, so it is essential that it functions correctly. Like any large IT system, it is subject to rigorous testing, independent audit and industry accreditation. Nevertheless, in the light of the concerns raised about serious glitches in the Horizon system, the Post Office commissioned an independent firm of forensic accountants, Second Sight, to investigate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/3">Second Sight produced two independent reports&#8212;one in 2013 and the other earlier this year&#8212;both of which found there was no evidence of systemic flaws in the system. That is an important point that I would like to reiterate in response to the shadow Minister&#8217;s point: there is no evidence of systemic flaws in the system. Second Sight&#8217;s reports have, rightly, pointed out some areas where the Post Office could have improved how it</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/4">operates, particularly on the training and support that it provided in some individual cases. As I said earlier, the Post Office is acting on those points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/5">The general secretary of the National Federation of SubPostmasters, George Thomson, told the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee in the last Parliament that the NFSP</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/6">&#8220;represent 7,000 sub-postmasters&#8230;If there was a systemic problem&#8230;we would be absolutely inundated.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/7">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/8">&#8220;Over the 15 years, the Horizon system has been fantastically robust.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/9">As well as improvements to training and support, the Post Office also launched a mediation scheme so that any current or former sub-postmaster who felt they had problems with the Horizon system could bring forward an application. They would have their cases thoroughly reinvestigated both by the Post Office and by Second Sight, and, if appropriate, proceed to mediation to seek to resolve any issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/10">It is important to understand that the mediation scheme is independent of the Government. That is the right approach for something that is a contractual matter between two independent businesses, and we should remember that sub-postmasters are independent businesspeople who have contracts with Post Office Ltd.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/11">Mediation is, of course, a voluntary process. Both parties need to consent to it, and for it to be successful there needs to be a reasonable chance of coming to a common understanding. Sometimes mediation will not be appropriate or will not succeed, but it is important to note that mediation cannot overturn a criminal conviction. I will come back to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.1/12">My hon. Friend the Member for North West Leicestershire and others have been critical of the mediation scheme and how it is progressing. He mentioned that 90% of cases are being excluded from mediation, but that statistic is not borne out by the information provided by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, which oversees the mediation scheme and is independent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1312.0/1">Given the number of postmasters and postmistresses who have been attending MPs&#8217; surgeries to discuss this matter, does not the Minister agree that one miscarriage of justice is one too many and that the Post Office has to be accountable for this system?</p>

	<p pid="b.1312.1/1">I absolutely accept that the Post Office must be accountable for any miscarriages and I will make a suggestion at the end about how we might address that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1312.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for North West Leicestershire raised the case of his constituent Mr Rudkin. As he will understand, I cannot comment on that or any other individual case, because their details are rightly confidential, but I reiterate an offer that has been made to all hon. Members who have a constituent in the scheme: Post Office Ltd has offered to meet to discuss individual cases in detail, provided the applicant gives their consent. I am aware that Post Office Ltd has repeated that offer to my hon. Friend in the last fortnight,</p>
	<p pid="b.1312.1/3">and I hope that he and others will take up that offer. I would be delighted to convene the meeting in my office in the Department if that helps.</p>
	<p pid="b.1312.1/4">I will move on to the points that my hon. Friend made about whether there may have been miscarriages of justice where sub-postmasters have been prosecuted and convicted. The Post Office handles large amounts of public money every day and operates a trusted role in communities, so it is vital that it has processes in place to protect that money and guard against fraud or theft. The Post Office can bring prosecutions against an individual, but it is down to the courts to determine whether they are guilty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1312.1/5">If an individual has been convicted and feels that their conviction is unsafe, they should explore the legal avenues open to them. They should seek advice on whether they can appeal their conviction, or raise their case with the Criminal Cases Review Commission. That is the correct way to deal with these issues if people believe there have been miscarriages of justice. The House cannot overturn a court ruling; nor, indeed, can mediation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.0/1">It is of course for individuals to decide whether they plead guilty and there is of course an avenue of appeal. Is it not important to note, however, that for many of these people the time for an appeal will be long past, so they remain the victims of a grave injustice?</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.1/1">As I say, if any individuals feel that their conviction is unsafe, they can always explore the legal avenues open to them. Where large numbers feel that that is the case, as is alleged, it is perfectly possible for them to bring a class action together. I do not accept that there is a fundamental injustice in the process that prevents people from bringing claims. I accept, however, that it is absolutely vital, where there is a legitimate claim against the Post Office about how it has treated its sub-postmasters, that those claims must be looked at properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.1/2">In the limited time available, I want to move on to the Post Office&#8217;s approach. Both tonight and elsewhere, my hon. Friend the Member for North West Leicestershire and others have raised the very serious dissatisfaction felt about the way in which the Post Office has handled relations with its sub-postmasters. When this debate was called, I spoke to the Post Office to understand the situation. I have received a letter from its chief executive, Paula Vennells, which I shall send to my hon. Friend and others who have spoken and place in the Library. The letter sets out just how seriously the Post Office has taken this matter. Ms Vennells says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.1/3">&#8220;We have gone to great lengths...because I was determined that, if there were problems with the Horizon system, these had to be identified and resolved.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.1/4">I will happily pick up any issues that my hon. Friend or others feel are not addressed in the letter.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.1/5">As I have already said, the mediation scheme is rightly independent of the Government. It was established jointly by the Post Office and the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, working with Second Sight, and it is overseen by an independent chair, a former Court of Appeal</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.1/6">judge. It is right that the details of individual cases should be confidential and that the Post Office respects that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.0/1">The Minister should be aware that one of the criteria given by the Post Office for removing cases from mediation was if a very large claim was involved. Those sub-postmasters who have suffered the greatest loss and the greatest injustice were therefore immediately excluded from the mediation system.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.1/1">That is a very interesting point, which I will be happy to take up with my hon. Friend, perhaps in the context of what I am about to suggest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.1/2">Although it remains the case that there is no evidence that the Horizon system is flawed, if any individual feels that their conviction is unsafe, they can pursue the legal avenues available to them. I do not see any reason for the Government to intervene in this matter by instigating a full judicial inquiry. However, I am struck by the extent of the concern expressed tonight by Members from both sides of the House and during the lead-up to this debate, including some of the specific testimony heard tonight. I will be happy to convene a meeting in the Department, perhaps led by my hon. Friend, with the support of others from across the House&#8212;to deal with the point he has just made and one or two others that have been made this evening&#8212;and to invite the Post Office to come to that meeting with representatives of sub-postmasters to try to iron out the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.1/3">My hon. Friend has raised other points that are a matter for the Post Office, rather than for the Government. I have no doubt that the Post Office has listened closely to this debate and will be in touch with him to answer his questions. I agree with him that this matter has gone on for far longer than anyone would wish and, for whatever reason, has been the cause of huge difficulties, trial and unnecessary hardship for a number of the sub-postmasters who have been affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.1/4">The important thing now is for the final cases in the mediation scheme to progress to mediation, and I urge all the parties involved to continue to work together to make that happen. That will help the individuals with cases remaining in the scheme to reach resolution, and it will mean that the Post Office can, working closely and collaboratively with its sub-postmasters, carry on with its essential role of serving communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.1/5">I repeat that some of the points made tonight in the House merit investigation. I will happily convene a meeting in the Department to put those specific points to Post Office Ltd. The system may have generally worked well for the vast majority of users, but that in itself is no reason not to ensure that those who have been legitimately unable to deal with the system should not be penalised unfairly. They certainly should not be made the victim of criminal judgments when their crime is nothing more than being unable to cope with a new IT system. I look forward to raising those points with the Post Office.</p>
