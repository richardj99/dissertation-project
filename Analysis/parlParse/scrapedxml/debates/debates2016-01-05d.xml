We share his view: we want to see greater choice in end-of-life care so that people are able to be cared for and die in the place they choose and which is appropriate to their needs, whether that is a hospice, a hospital or their own home. The recent Choice review set out a vision of enabling greater choice at the end of life. I am working with NHS England to see how this can be best achieved and the Government expect to comment on that soon.</p>

Before he responds to the Report on the Regulation of Herbal Medicines and Practitioners, will he look very carefully at dispensing arrangements for the small-scale assembly of herbal products, something the Government of the People&#8217;s Republic of China are very interested in?</p>

	<p pid="d.3.0/1">Herbal products are slightly beyond my normal portfolio remit, but anything that assists in social care and makes people feel better and can add to their vitality and wellbeing is to be welcomed. I am sure in many local areas they are taken extremely seriously.</p>

	<p pid="d.3.1/1">I thank the Minister for his response. Integration and improving care outside of hospitals is just one way we can revolutionise the health service. Will the Minister outline any links his Department is exploring between reducing pressure on A&amp;Es and using care provision outside of hospitals to facilitate reducing that pressure?</p>

	<p pid="d.3.2/1">Absolutely, and a number of the pilots and pioneer programmes are doing just that. Early results from the living well programme in Penwith in Cornwall show a 49% reduction in non-elective admissions to hospital and a 36% reduction in emergency admissions to hospital. So the hon. Gentleman is right: better social care and better integration may have, and should have, an impact on hospital admissions and make sure people are receiving the most appropriate care in the most appropriate place.</p>

	<p pid="d.3.3/1">I was pleased to hear the Minister&#8217;s reference to the integrated care organisation that is being created in my constituency. Given the increasing challenge of providing social care to those in the later stages of life, does he agree that this is a model that needs to be looked at, and will he give it as much support as he can?</p>

	<p pid="d.3.4/1">Indeed; the ability to see how these pilot projects respond to the different demographics in different areas enables one area to learn from another. Torbay has come up frequently in this context, and I am pleased to be able to praise it again. While I am on my feet, I should also like to point out that many of those involved in adult social care were greatly affected by the recent flooding in the north of England and that they were looking after vulnerable people and working beyond the front line. That work was very important, and I am grateful to Ray James of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and to all those working in local authorities in the affected areas who contributed so well to looking after vulnerable people during that period.</p>

	<p pid="d.3.5/1">The report on the appalling failures at Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust highlighted the fact that more than 1,000 unexpected deaths of mental health and learning disability patients, many of which took place outside hospital, had not been investigated. Given that the Health Secretary did not allow the House an opportunity to scrutinise those findings before Christmas, will he or the Minister respond today to the widely held concern that the experience of that NHS trust is not an isolated one? Does the Minister agree that a national public investigation is now needed?</p>

	<p pid="d.4.0/1">The hon. Lady is quite right. As my right hon. Friend the Health Secretary said in relation to that urgent question, this is a wider concern. That is why the Care Quality Commission is looking at the picture of what has happened nationally. These deaths have not been investigated appropriately in the past, and that must change. This Government are determined to change a range of things in relation to mental health and learning disabilities, and this is one area that has been forgotten for too long. It has now been brought to light, and work is being done by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.4.5/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That system does not work for people who have to go to work, and we want to make it easier for people to book appointments online or using an app on their phone. We also want to make it easier for people living in rural areas such as his constituency of North Cornwall to have telehealth appointments where appropriate, so that they can see someone without actually having to go to the surgery.</p>

	<p pid="d.4.6/1">Given the increasing difficulty that members of the public are having in getting an appointment with their GP quickly and at a time that is convenient to them, does the Secretary of State believe that his predecessor was wrong when, as one of his first acts, he scrapped Labour&#8217;s 48-hour GP access guarantee?</p>

	<p pid="d.4.7/1">No I do not, because that had perverse consequences. When that target was in place, the number of people waiting to see a GP increased rather than decreased. In the last Parliament, the number of GPs went up by around 1,600&#8212;a 5% increase in the workforce&#8212;and we have plans to increase it by 13%, which would be one of the biggest-ever increases in the GP workforce in the history of the NHS, on the back of a strong economy.</p>

He also claimed that there had been a 30% reduction in GP partners&#8217; incomes in the past five years, and said that more and more GPs in Slough were turning to private practice. I have noticed that they are also resisting the creation of new GP practices. What is the Secretary of State doing to ensure that under-doctored areas such as mine get more GPs?</p>

Alongside a number of other schemes, it has had a significant impact on reducing emergency admissions in her area. The answer to the point she makes is that we are investing an extra &#163;8 billion in the NHS over the course of this Parliament&#8212;it is &#163;10 billion when we include the money going in this year. We have said that we want more of that money to go into general practice, to reverse the historical underfunding of general practice, which I completely agree needs to be reversed.</p>

We had to bring in the requirement for safer staffing rotas because of the catastrophe at Mid Staffs and the need to try to staff hospitals better, and that had an immediate consequence which called for agency workers. Unfortunately, some companies have taken advantage of that situation, but we have introduced measures to stop that and are already having an impact across the service.</p>

The fund was introduced by the previous Government, and we are very proud of it. It has made a big difference to the lives of more than 80,000 patients. More widely, the recent cancer taskforce published its report, &#8220;Achieving world-class cancer outcomes&#8221;, and it made many recommendations, which are particularly relevant to rarer cancers and blood cancers, many of which focus on improving access to diagnostic testing.</p>

Among the things that the Government are doing that will make a really big difference to some of the institutions that he mentioned and others, and particularly to sufferers, is the 100,000 genomes project, in which the Government have invested. The creation of a network of genetic medicine centres will underpin that further development of genetic testing services. As a very large proportion of rare diseases are genetically based, we want to make significant progress with that genomic work.</p>

The early evidence from the better care fund, which we launched only this year to tackle this very issue, is 85,000 fewer delayed transfers, 12,000 more older people at home within three months of discharge, and nearly 3,000 people supported to live independently. Through more funding, greater freedoms and local devolution, we are supporting health leaders and council leaders to bring together health and care.</p>

We hear very little from the Labour party about Wales, where it is responsible for the health service, and an awful lot of questions about England, where fortunately it is not responsible.

As I say, the Government have made a &#163;3.5 billion commitment from the new precept and the better care fund is a significant commitment, but he is right&#8212;we will have to go further.

It is risky that the proposed increases in the better care fund are back-loaded; they do not reach &#163;1.5 billion until 2019-20. The social care precept funding is uncertain because it will raise only &#163;1.6 billion by 2020 if every single council decides to raise the maximum possible. Social care is in crisis now.

The Opposition say that it is not enough and that it will fail, but the data do not support that. If we look at the early data from the better care fund, which was introduced by this Government early last year, we see 85,000 fewer delayed transfers, 12,500 more older people at home within three months of discharge and 3,000 people supported to live independently.

Nationally, the numbers of looked-after and abused children in the new prevalence survey&#8212;the first since 2004&#8212;would be relatively small.

	<p pid="d.15.8/1">My hon. Friend is right to point out that there are different ways into nursing. Just a few weeks ago, we announced a massive expansion in apprenticeships across the NHS, and I anticipate that a significant number will be for those going into nursing. The new post of nursing associate is a vocational route into nursing via an apprenticeship. In addition, our reforms to bursaries will ensure that there is a 25% increase in funding to recipients, bringing it into line with the rest of the student cohort. That cohort has seen a considerable expansion in the number of students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds as a result of the reforms that we undertook in 2011 and 2012.</p>

	<p pid="d.16.0/1">Does the Minister accept that his Government&#8217;s decision to cut nurse training places by 3,000 a year since 2010 has led to the huge shortage of nursing staff in the NHS and an increased reliance on nurses recruited from abroad and expensive agency staff, and that that will get worse with the abolition of bursaries? Is not this a textbook example of a false economy from the Government?</p>

	<p pid="d.16.1/1">The hon. Lady should look at the facts. March 2015 saw a record number of nurses in the NHS&#8212;319,595. We are increasing the number of nurse training places. We are able to increase them by considerably more than we could have done otherwise, as a result of the reforms to student finance that bring nurses into line with teachers and other public sector professionals.</p>

	<p pid="d.16.2/1">It would be good to hear the Minister concede that it was a bad idea back in 2010 to cut the number of nurse training places. Even today we are still training fewer nurses than we were in 2009. Not only have this Government failed to recruit enough nurses, they have failed to retain them too: last year there was a 12% increase in the number of nurses leaving hospitals. With staff morale already at an all-time low, why does the Minister think it is right that nurses should be burdened with a lifetime of debt to pay for his Government&#8217;s mistakes?</p>

One of the things we are undertaking at the moment is to talk intensively with universities to see how we can reduce attrition rates. We have had some success in some areas, but I want to see far more. It is important that students stay on their courses as much as possible. Of course, many go into community nursing.

Nobody wants strikes, not least the junior doctors, but they feel badly let down by a Health Secretary who seems to think that contract negotiations are a game of brinkmanship. When will he admit that changing the definition of unsocial hours and the associated rates of pay for junior doctors is a forerunner to changing a whole load of other NHS staffing contracts to save on the NHS pay bill?

	<p pid="d.18.2/2">Not content with alienating one group of staff, the Health Secretary now has another target: student nurses. The disastrous decision in the first half of the last Parliament to cut nurse training places has driven the rise in the agency staff bill. We all know that we need more nurses to be trained, but why should a trainee nurse who spends half their degree caring for patients not receive a bursary? If they are on a ward at 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning, why should they be expected to pay for the privilege?</p>

Let me tell her why there are 8,500 more nurses in our hospital wards since I became Health Secretary. It is because of the Francis inquiry into Mid Staffs.

Since the Chancellor announced the scrapping of bursaries for trainee nurses and midwives, there has been a worrying reduction in the number of applications for next year&#8217;s training, compared with what we would expect to see at this time of year.

	<p pid="d.19.1/1">We have record levels of nurses in training and a record number of nurses in practice because of the decision by my right hon. Friend the Health Secretary to increase nurse training by 11% over the past two years. We can expand that significantly due to our reforms to the funding of nurse training. As regards nurses from abroad, part of the reason we are undertaking this change is so that every putative nurse in this country can have the opportunity of having a nursing position.

	<p pid="d.26.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the European Council meeting that took place before Christmas. The Council focused on three issues: migration, terrorism and the UK&#8217;s renegotiation. I will take each in turn.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/2">First, on migration, even in winter there are still many migrants coming to Europe, with over 3,000 arriving via the eastern Mediterranean route each day. Of course, Britain is not part of the Schengen open border arrangements, and we are not going to be joining; we have our own border controls, and they apply to everyone attempting to enter the UK and every day help to keep us safe. Let me repeat: these controls apply to all, including EU citizens. We have stopped nearly 95,000 people at our borders since 2010, including almost 6,000 EU nationals. These people were not allowed to come in.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/3">What Schengen countries are now trying to put in place is a pale imitation of what we already have. What they do, of course, is a matter for them, but it is in our interests to help our European partners secure their external borders. So we have provided more technical expertise to the European Asylum Support Office than any other European country, including practical assistance to help with the registering and fingerprinting of migrants when they arrive in countries such as Greece and Italy. We have focused on the root causes&#8212;not just the consequences&#8212;of the migration crisis. That is why we continue to play a leading role in the efforts of the international Syria support group to end the conflict in Syria through a political process and why we have backed the agreement reached recently in Morocco that should pave the way for a new united, national government in Libya. We have deployed HMS Enterprise to go after the people traffickers in the Mediterranean and have provided &#163;1.12 billion in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian conflict&#8212;by far the largest commitment of any European country and second only to America. In addition, the donor conference I am hosting next month with Germany, Kuwait, Norway and the United Nations will help further by raising significant new funding to help refugees in the region this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/4">The Council focused on implementing the previously agreed measures on refugee resettlement. In Britain, we said we would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees during this Parliament, taking them directly from the camps, and I can tell the House that, exactly as we promised, over 1,000 Syrian refugees from camps in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon were resettled here in time for Christmas. These people are now in homes, their children are starting this new year in our schools and they can look forward to building a new life here in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/5">Many in the House have called for us to take more refugees or to take part in the EU relocation and resettlement schemes. The reality is that we have already done significantly more than most of our EU partners in this regard. The House might be interested to hear the figures: by the time of the December Council, only 208 refugees had been relocated within the EU out of the 160,000 agreed, and in all other member states put together, according to the most recent statistics, just</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/6">483 refugees had been resettled from outside the EU under the EU&#8217;s voluntary resettlement scheme. The point is clear: we said what we would do, and we got on and did it.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/7">Turning to terrorism, the latest appalling video from Daesh is a reminder of its brutality and barbarism. It is desperate stuff from an organisation that hates us not for what we do, but for what we are&#8212;a democratic multi-faith, multi-ethnic nation built on tolerance, democracy and respect for human rights. Britain will never be cowed by terror. We will stand up and defend our values and our way of life, and with patience and persistence, we will defeat these extremists and eradicate this evil organisation.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/8">I am sure the whole House will want to join me in paying tribute to the British servicemen and women who have spent this Christmas and new year away from their families. In the last month, RAF aircraft have conducted 82 strikes in Iraq and Syria. In recent weeks, the priority of the international coalition has been supporting the Iraqi security forces&#8217; successful recapture of Ramadi, to which our airstrikes made an important contribution. They have also helped Kurdish forces to repel major Daesh counter-attacks in northern Iraq. In Syria, there have been 11 RAF strike missions, 10 against Daesh-controlled oil infrastructure and one against Daesh terrorists near Raqqa. We continue to fly intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, providing vital support to our other coalition partners.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/9">As for the discussion at the Council, we now have a clear agreement on rules to share passenger name records. This is a vital breakthrough, but we still need to go further, so the Council agreed to take forward urgent proposals on more systematic data sharing, on stepping up our co-operation on aviation security and on working together to do even more to starve Daesh of money and resources, choking off the oil and clamping down on firearms and explosives to stop them getting into the hands of terrorists. We also agreed to do more across Europe to counter the extremist propaganda and the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism that is the root cause of the terrorism that we face. The threat from Daesh is a threat to us all, and we must stand together to defeat it.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/10">Turning to the UK renegotiation. I have set out the four areas where Britain is seeking significant and far-reaching reforms: on sovereignty and subsidiarity, where Britain must not be part of an &#8220;ever-closer union&#8221; and where we want a greater role for national Parliaments; on competitiveness, where the EU must add to our competitiveness, rather than detract from it, by signing new trade deals, cutting regulation and completing the single market; on fairness for countries inside and outside the eurozone, where the EU must protect the integrity of the single market and ensure there is no disadvantage, discrimination or additional costs for a country like Britain, which is not in the euro and which in my view is never going to join the euro; and on migration, where we need to tackle abuses of the right to free movement, and deliver changes that ensure that our welfare system is not an artificial draw for people to come to Britain.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/11">This is the first time a country has tried to renegotiate its membership of the EU from a standing start. Many doubted it was even possible, but at this Council we had an entire session focused on this issue, lasting several hours, and with almost every European leader contributing. I am happy to go into detail on what was an extensive discussion, but the key points were these. There was strong support for Britain to stay in the EU. European leaders began their remarks by saying not that Britain is better off in Europe, but that Europe would be better off with Britain staying in it. All wanted to reach an agreement that would address the concerns we have raised. There was extensive discussion of all four areas, and difficulties were raised with all four of them. The most difficult issues were around free movement and welfare.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/12">There was, however, a great deal of good will. At the end of the discussion, the Council agreed&#8212;and I quote directly from the conclusions&#8212;that we would</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/13">&#8220;work closely together to find mutually satisfactory solutions in all the four areas&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/14">I think it significant that the conclusions talk about solutions, not compromises, and I made it clear that these solutions would require changes that were legally binding and irreversible. So while each of these areas will require hard work, I believe that there is now a pathway to an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/15">Later this week, I am continuing my efforts to secure that agreement with further discussions in Germany and Hungary, and I hope we can reach a full agreement when the Council meets again next month. What matters is getting the substance right, not the speed of the deal. If we can see this through and secure these changes, we will succeed in fundamentally changing the UK&#8217;s relationship with the EU, finally addressing the concerns that the British people have over our membership. If we cannot do that, as I have said before, I rule nothing out.</p>
	<p pid="d.26.1/16">My intention is that, at the conclusion of the renegotiation, the Government should reach a clear recommendation, and then the referendum will be held. It is the nature of a referendum that it is the people, not the politicians, who decide, and as I indicated before Christmas, there will be a clear Government position, but it will be open to individual Ministers to take a different personal position while remaining part of the Government. Ultimately, it will be for the British people to decide this country&#8217;s future by voting in or out of a reformed European Union in the referendum that only we promised and that only a Conservative majority Government were able to deliver. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.28.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement, a copy of which I received a short time ago. I wish you, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister and the House a very happy new year. I hope that the Prime Minister will not misinterpret that greeting in any way whatever and will take it in the spirit in which it is meant&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Thank you.</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/2">Last month, I travelled to Brussels to meet European leaders, including Prime Ministers, to discuss the issues our Prime Minister has raised today. I learnt a lot at that meeting. I learnt that the Prime Minister has botched his negotiations with European leaders. I also learnt that many of our European colleagues have an intuitive understanding of British politics&#8212;they know that the Prime Minister has asked for help so that he can win a referendum he never wanted to hold.</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/3">Does the Prime Minister now accept that his attempts to bludgeon leaders into accepting his flawed reforms have failed and that he has come back with very little? Can he really be surprised at his failure, when he has not worked with his negotiating partners in Europe, and failed even to turn up when asked for help on the European refugee crisis? To deliver change, you need patient, effective diplomacy and you need to make friends.<i>[Interruption.]</i> Indeed we all value our friends. But the Prime Minister is not interested in that; he is more interested in his own party. He is playing politics, rather than putting forward the interests of the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/4">Can the Prime Minister now explain whether his Government will have a view on the choice facing the people of this country in the referendum, and how will that be reached and expressed? What has he had to say to Lord Heseltine, who said Britain would become</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/5">&#8220;a laughing stock across the world&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/6">if the Prime Minister made the announcement he has today? Leaders across Europe can see that the Prime Minister&#8217;s demands are a bluff, a fig leaf for Conservative party politics. Does he accept that his bluff has now been called?</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/7">The Prime Minister said that he wanted to secure more for national parliaments in the EU. It is now clear that he has achieved nothing of any substance on that point. Does he also accept, as experts have warned, that his proposals for reforming migrant benefits are not only likely to be ineffective in reducing any inward migration, but are discriminatory and unfair and likely to be legally challenged? Can he confirm that he has now abandoned those plans altogether? Can he also confirm once and for all that he has dropped his utterly disgraceful plans to weaken what is already weak workers&#8217; protection in this country when compared with the workers&#8217; protection offered in other European countries?</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/8">Essentially, the Prime Minister&#8217;s proposals are a distraction. The real issue is about delivering a better, more cohesive, more democratic and progressive Europe that promotes security and protection for workers, and delivers investment and a productive economy to support jobs and sustainable growth. That is why in the upcoming referendum we will fight to ensure those things are delivered in the European Union as part of a progressive reform agenda.</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/9">I would like to ask the Prime Minister something more about the refugee crisis, and what he is doing to help in this growing humanitarian crisis. First, I want to put on record my thanks to the Royal Navy and all other service personnel working in the Mediterranean trying to save lives. They have done a great job and they have saved a very large number of people who were desperate to cross the Mediterranean and find a place of safety. What funding is Britain offering to assist in the collective effort to deal with the refugee crisis across Europe? There is a very serious crisis in many countries on the borders of Europe, and we also face the present situation in Calais.</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/10">Can the Prime Minister confirm that Britain is fully part of, and signed up to, the negotiated political peace process to try to bring about a ceasefire in the Syrian civil war, and is he in a position to update us on anything to do with that?</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/11">Does the Prime Minister agree that we now need a pan-European humanitarian relief programme, co- ordinated by the United Nations, to assess the status of all refugees and provide proper refugee support? The Government are simply not going far enough to help those in need. Will the Prime Minister commit himself to accepting at least 20,000 refugees over the next two years, rather than the next five? Will he support calls for Britain to take in 3,000 vulnerable and unaccompanied children who are currently in a quite desperate situation?</p>
	<p pid="d.28.0/12">Does the Prime Minister not recognise that by isolating Britain from Europe, he is making it more difficult for us to work as partners on all these issues, and that once again he is putting the politics of his own party above the national interest? Will he join me in seeking a more progressive union across Europe which will deliver welfare and security to our workers and our economy, rather than the agenda that he has put before us today?</p>

	<p pid="d.30.0/1">Let me wish the right hon. Gentleman&#8212;along with you, Mr Speaker&#8212;a very happy new year. Let me also apologise for interrupting what is clearly the longest reshuffle in history. We could have watched the entire run of &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; movies, but we still do not know who has been seduced to the dark side. There is absolutely no sign of a rebel alliance emerging either: I can see that.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman had the temerity to say that this was a referendum that I did not want. This is a referendum that I put to the British people in a manifesto. It is odd to hear such talk from the right hon. Gentleman, who has a shadow Foreign Secretary whom he does not want.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked a number of questions. Let me now answer them. He asked whether the Government would make a clear recommendation. Yes, we will: I said that very clearly in my statement. He asked whether the national Parliament measures were still in place. Yes, they are, and they received a warm reception from a number of other European countries. He asked about welfare benefits. Our four-year proposal remains on the table. I have said that I am very happy to look at alternatives, but I will not take my proposal off the table until I see something equally effective being put forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.0/4">I would just note that at the last election, it was Labour policy to ask people coming to this country to live and work here for several years before claiming benefits. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Labour Members can all call out about what a great policy it was, but it has now been abandoned by their leader. Never mind how many Eagles we end up with; I think we have all worked out that they have an albatross at the head of their party. <i>[</i><i>Laughter</i><i>.</i><i>]</i></p>
	<p pid="d.30.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman asked about refugees. I think he was right to praise the Royal Navy for the work that it does. As for funding, let me make it very clear that we believe the EU can do more, but the EU has a generous budget to which we are a significant contributor. In all our conversations we asked the EU to use its existing budget, knowing that countries like Britain have made huge contributions, outside the EU budget, to the excellent United Nations programmes. If only other EU countries were as generous to those programmes as we have been, we would ease the Syrian refugee crisis by a huge amount. As I said in my statement, we have contributed &#163;1.12 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether we were signed up to the Syrian peace process. Yes, we are. We have been one of the leading players behind that process. There was a good meeting in New York in December, but more meetings will be needed to bring about the ceasefires and the political discussions that are necessary. I will keep the House updated on that, as will the Foreign Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="d.30.0/7">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether we would take more migrants. I think that the 20,000 resettlement is the right number. I stress again that we have gone ahead and delivered what we said we would, which is in stark contrast to many other promises made by other countries. He asked about the issue of the 3,000 orphans. I said in the Syria debate that we would look seriously at that issue, but there are problems. Of course we can think about helping, but we must be careful to ensure that we are not removing people from their wider families. We need to look carefully at those who have tragically lost parents.</p>

Now that some of our right hon. and hon. Friends are taking an unaccustomed interest in benefit rules, will he confirm that his proposal on the table for a four-year limitation is stimulating a discussion with other countries anxious to take away unnecessary draws to their countries of other EU nationals, to find a solution so that we have coming here only people who will work legally in a way that benefits the British economy?</p>

	<p pid="d.31.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes two very powerful points. First, the ever-closer union does matter, not purely as a symbolic issue, but because it does get used as an interpretation by the European Court and has been one of the things that people feel has driven something of a ratchet in terms of EU law, so it is vital that we are fully carved out of that. He is right as well about benefits. Of course this is a controversial issue in Europe, but other countries share our concerns. Indeed, some of the countries that people are leaving are also concerned about the potential hollowing out of their countries as so many young people in their 20s and 30s leave. My point is simple: Britain has benefited hugely from migration and we should continue to support migration and free movement, but the extra artificial draw that our in-work benefit systems can bring badly needs to be addressed.</p>

	<p pid="d.31.2/1">It is our first day back in Parliament so this is our first opportunity to say that our hearts go out to all around the country who are suffering from the recent and ongoing flooding. In particular we think of the families who have lost loved ones, and who have endured damage to their homes and their businesses, and we should put on record our appreciation for the response of the emergency services and of neighbours, friends and total strangers who have been making a difference.</p>
	<p pid="d.31.2/2">The biggest European challenge in 2016 is not the negotiations of the Prime Minister and his position on Cabinet splits, which have been described by Swedish statesman Carl Bildt as &#8220;more than bizarre&#8221;; the biggest issue for our continent is the refugee crisis, the instability in the middle east and the threat of terrorism. Three EU member states have immigration opt-outs: the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark. But both Ireland and Denmark are part of the EU refugee programme, while the UK has stood aside. Given the overwhelmingly warm welcome and positive humanitarian response in the UK to Syrians fleeing conflict, will the Prime Minister reconsider that position? At least, will he follow the advice of the Select Committee on International Development and help more refugee children, just as the UK did with Jewish children in the past through the Kindertransport?</p>
	<p pid="d.31.2/3">On the instability in the middle east, how is the Prime Minister going to step up diplomatic support for the Vienna process and help secure a ceasefire in Syria? Does he understand the growing concern about the worrying confrontation involving Saudi Arabia and Iran? Is it not time, however, to do more than just condemn those who behead, crucify and shoot those they disagree with? Is it not time for concrete action by the UK Government?</p>
	<p pid="d.31.2/4">On European reform, it is an open secret that three of the four demands of the Prime Minister are so limited that they are almost universally uncontentious. On EU citizens working in the UK, why do we not hear more from the Government about their positive contribution to our communities, public services and the private sector, and the massive tax bonus the UK receives from EU taxpayers living in the UK? Will the Prime Minister confirm that this positive EU bonus massively outweighs any abuses of in-work benefits?</p>
	<p pid="d.31.2/5">Will the Prime Minister finally&#8212;because he has had many opportunities to do this&#8212;give a guarantee that if Scotland votes to remain within the EU, it will stay within it? <i>[Interruption.] </i>The public at home will hear the groans from the Conservative Benches; the people of Scotland want to know if they will be taken out of the EU against their will. Will the Prime Minister give that guarantee today&#8212;he has failed to do it thus far?</p>

	<p pid="d.32.0/1">On the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s last point, Scotland had a referendum on whether to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the former Scottish First Minister, now <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10525" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond)</phrase>, and I signed the Edinburgh agreement, which said that both sides had to respect the outcome of that referendum. That is the only answer that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11189" name="Angus Robertson">the right hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase> needs.</p>
	<p pid="d.32.0/2">I join the right hon. Gentleman in paying tribute to the emergency services and the Army for the incredible work they have done during the recent floods. Our hearts go out to all those who have had homes, businesses and shops flooded. Let us also pay tribute to the amazing spirit of the British people who have come together at Christmastime and made huge sacrifices to help to each other. It is remarkable what those communities have done.</p>
	<p pid="d.32.0/3">In answer to the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question on the EU refugee programme, we believe that our resettlement programme is better run by ourselves. We have done it well and quickly, and we have brought more people into Britain from Syria than other countries have been able to resettle. We are also able to carry out our own safeguarding checks on those people. I have already answered the question on the 3,000 orphan children, which we are looking at again.</p>
	<p pid="d.32.0/4">The point that the right hon. Gentleman made about three of the four things we are asking for being uncontentious is simply not true. I encourage him to spend more time talking to European colleagues about just how difficult these things are to achieve. On the issue of the Vienna process, we have a clear view that we condemn and do not support the death penalty wherever it takes place, Saudi Arabia included. On the Vienna process, we have to find a way of trying to get Iran and Saudi Arabia into the room at the same time to negotiate what will happen in a Syrian transition. We have to be clear that that is our greatest priority. Dealing with the Syrian crisis, which is the source of so much of the terror that we face and the source of the migration crisis that is facing Europe, has to be top of mine.</p>

	<p pid="d.33.1/1">Once this negotiation is complete, people will have to ask the big question about whether Britain is better off inside or outside a reformed European Union. The question will also be about whether we will be safer and more prosperous. I believe that this renegotiation will make a difference on competitiveness, on sovereignty, on the euro and on the issue of migration. People will also be asking the bigger question about whole of the position of Britain in Europe, and what the Government and I are doing is making sure that the choice people face is not between the status quo and leaving altogether but between an important amendment to the status quo and leaving altogether. It is right that we get that right.</p>

They are of a similar age to my children and those of the Prime Minister, but they are alone and separated from their parents. They are vulnerable to exploitation and prostitution, as well as to the cold, to bronchitis and to scabies. The longer the Prime Minister looks at this proposal to help 3,000 children, the more of them will simply disappear. The proposal has cross-party support, and I urge him to agree today to work with Save the Children on a plan for Britain to help 3,000 unaccompanied children from across Europe.

I have said this at the Dispatch Box before. On the question of the people at Calais, we are clear that we will do everything we can to help the French with border security and with helping to process people who are in France, but at the end of the day, people do not have the right to try to break into Britain against our rules. Those people in Calais should be properly processed and dealt with by the French.</p>

	<p pid="d.34.6/1">First, on what my right hon. Friend says about what Britain is doing in the EU to counter terrorist propaganda, we have taken the expertise that we have built up here and are sharing that with other European countries as we set up some new organisations. It is very important to win this battle of ideas&#8212;in some ways it is a battle of ideas, as we faced in the cold war. I am not sure I go all the way with him on what he said about &#8220;either television or newspapers&#8221;. As he said, television media have been responsible. I do not think it would be right to have some sort of blanket ban on showing any parts of these videos. Indeed, showing a part of these videos and just how ghastly and brutal this organisation is, for instance in the way it is using children, reminds everybody, not least those who might be tempted by this radical organisation, of just what a sick organisation it is. On the whole, the media have been fairly responsible about this, and I think it is much better to have that form of self-restraint than anything else.</p>

I cannot guarantee that we will reach agreement in February. The Council agreed that we would try to reach agreement on all four issues in February; so that is the aim. If that is possible, I am keen to get on and hold a referendum. We should not do it precipitately. I have looked at precedents. I note that when Labour held a referendum in 1975, there was only a month between the completion of the legislation and the referendum, which was not enough time. When we had the referendum on the alternative vote in the previous Government that I led, the period was less than three months, which was also not enough. We should be looking for a period longer than that, but, believe me, by the time we get to the end of the referendum campaign, everyone will have had enough of the subject.</p>

One is the abuse whereby people have used the free movement legislation to bring criminals to the United Kingdom and the other is where they take part in immigration practices that are against our rules. Those abuses need to be dealt with. As I have said, our welfare system has provided an unnatural draw to the UK and we need to further control immigration inside the EU by addressing that problem.</p>

One of the reasons that the problem of the draw of our welfare system arises is that unlike many other European countries we have a system to which there is immediate access.

I am open to all sorts of suggestions, including the one that my hon. Friend made.

When this debate comes, a lot of it will rightly focus on security questions. Although there are still many imperfections in the way border controls and the exchange of information work, there is no doubt that we will benefit hugely from the passenger name record legislation that is coming through: it does not just tell us which passengers are coming to our country but where they bought their ticket, which credit card they used and where they are from. This is vital information which, combined with the Schengen Information System information, will help us to stop terrorists getting into our country. Of course, arguments can be made on both sides, but I think the security argument will be crucial in determining what is the right future for Britain.</p>

The argument will be about whether we would be more prosperous and more secure inside or outside a reformed EU. To answer his question directly&#8212;I answered this when I went to Iceland&#8212;countries such as Iceland and Norway have to obey all the rules of the single market, including on the free movement of people, but without having any say on what those rules are. In Norway it has been described as democracy by fax, because the instructions comes through from Brussels, and they pay more per head to the EU than we do.

But that needs to happen after the negotiation has taken place. I think that Members on both sides of the House, and indeed members of the public and businesses and others, want to know what the renegotiation amounts to.

	<p pid="d.41.3/1">First of all, I send the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituents my sympathy for the flooding that they suffered. Let me say that we will do everything we can, including through the Bellwin scheme, to make sure that his council is fully reimbursed for all the emergency measures that it had to take. We will also make sure that we put in place the flood prevention measures and investment that are coming down the track.</p>
	<p pid="d.41.3/2">I have looked very carefully at the question of EU funding; we looked at it previously in 2013. It takes a very long time to get hold of any money and it is very uncertain whether you get it. Indeed, you end up paying for it in many ways as well. I think it is quicker and better to give people the help they need from our own resources.</p>

	<p pid="d.42.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right to raise this issue. It is why a defence co-operation operation is being undertaken in the Mediterranean, in which Britain is playing a very leading part with HMS Enterprise, which is exactly to go after the people smugglers. In time, when there is a proper Government in Libya, we need an agreement with that country that we can stop boats, and indeed turn back boats, when we think that these people should be properly dealt with in Libya&#8212;as I say, we need to break the link between their getting in a boat and settlement in Europe. We are working with all the Governments available, but crucially we need a Government in Libya with which we can deal.</p>

We have seen exactly the same, and we will see more, with regard to the eurozone, where we want to make absolutely sure that we suffer no disadvantage, we cannot be involved in bail-out schemes, and the British position is protected. That is a return of power. Look at what we are trying to achieve on deregulation, where we are saying that we need deregulation targets and cuts in regulation&#8212;that is about powers coming back to Britain. If you look at what we are saying about a subsidiarity test where every year the European Council should be asking, &#8220;Are these powers and these areas of powers still necessary, and can they be returned?, you see that the whole aim of this renegotiation is to say, &#8220;Yes, we are part of a European Union that is reformed and that can achieve greater prosperity and greater security for Britain, but we are doing it as a proud nation state with institutions that serve the people who put us here.&#8221;</p>

I am committed to working with the new Portuguese Prime Minister. We will see what emerges in Spain. I work very closely with Prime Minister Rajoy, who did a very good job for his country in difficult circumstances. These election results show how we need reform in Europe.

	<p pid="d.43.2/1">My hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right. One of the problems that has emerged is that the legal changes that have been made have defined free movement in a more and more generous way. It used to be the case that it was free movement to go and take a job for which you had applied, whereas today, I think I am right in saying, 60% of those who come to Britain are job applicants&#8212;they do not have a job when they come. This is another reason we need to address the welfare issue, because those people will be particularly affected by changes to in-work welfare, and we will not have that unnatural draw to Britain. Many people who come to Britain work hard and contribute and all the rest of it, but we need to make sure that our arrangements reduce the unnatural pull of migration to Britain, as my hon. and learned Friend set out.</p>

That is not what is happening. There has been quite significant reform. There has also been some fairly significant reform to the common fisheries policy.

	<p pid="d.45.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important argument, but I think there are forces going in both directions. On the good side, the widening of the European Union to include the Baltic states, the Nordic countries and the Balkan states has been a great advance for the British agenda, and the fact that we are focusing Europe on doing trade deals with the fastest growing parts of the world, rather than looking inwards, is a great advance in the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="d.45.3/2">However, there are still proposals for more federalistic approaches and Britain has successively carved itself out of those things. If Europe wants a border force to help police its external borders, that is a matter for them and is not something we will take part in. If the eurozone wants to pass a series of laws to have a fiscal union or mutual debt obligations, that is a matter for it. It is fine, as long as we are not involved. What I aim to get through the renegotiation is the best of both worlds for Britain&#8212;in Europe where it is to our benefit, but not involved in those things that involve the wrong passage of sovereignty from this place to others.</p>

One of the strongest voices of support for the British renegotiation was the Irish Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, who made a brilliant speech at the European Council, for which I will for ever be very grateful. The Republic of Ireland wants Britain to stay in the European Union, because all sorts of difficult issues would arise in respect of the border and other things if we were outside it. Of course, the Republic of Ireland sees Britain as a strong voice in Europe for many of the things it believes in. Look, we have to get this deal right, and then we need to bring all the arguments to bear on both sides of the case. I think that what is said by those in the Republic and in Northern Ireland will make a big difference.</p>

More action is being taken in Europe, but some countries, particularly some of the Nordic countries, have an issue because of the way in which their citizens defence forces are set up. We need to go through all those problems to check that we can do more. Stopping the arms coming from the Balkans is absolutely key.</p>

	<p pid="d.51.1/1">We are not a Schengen country, so there is no prospect of us being part of a European external border force. Our external border is well delineated and well protected, but we should obviously look at what more we can do. Should we, however, stop other European countries if they want to get together and do more at their external border? No, I do not think we should. Frankly, we want to see a better-protected European border. Whether or not we would co-operate, work with or help some future force, I do not know, but it could be properly looked at. At the moment, even though we are not in Schengen, we have more people working on the European Asylum Support Office than any other European country. In the end, we recognise that protecting Europe&#8217;s external border is in our interest. Again, I think we can have the best of both worlds: we can keep our border controls and keep out of Schengen, while encouraging other European countries to do more on their external border and providing help where appropriate and necessary, but make sure that we maintain our own sovereignty in this vital regard.</p>

This is how the Prime Minister has started 2016, but for most of 2014 the Prime Minister was telling us that being part of the United Kingdom was the only way to guarantee our membership of the EU.

Having met the Spanish Prime Minister several times, I am not sure that there are many circumstances in which the Spanish would ever let an independent Scotland back into the European Union. That is the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s first question. The answer to the second is that we had a referendum on whether Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom. Scotland voted to stay in the United Kingdom and the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party vowed to abide by the decision taken&#8212;for one United Kingdom.</p>

Thanks to the excellent work of the Under-Secretary of State for Refugees, we have fulfilled our pledge. If we look at the resettlement and relocation schemes that the EU spent a lot of time discussing, so far they have not amounted to as many as the 1,000 people that we have helped. I am sure that they will over time, but my point is that Britain is a country that prides itself on signing agreements, implementing them and doing the things that are set out in those agreements. That is exactly what we have done with Syrian refugees.</p>

One thousand by Christmas was a big ask, but we did it. The fact that the British Red Cross, a caseworker and interpreter were with these people provided an example and a reminder for me that bringing them here properly and under the right terms, so that they have the services they need, means that we have done this the right way round.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.56.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10426" speakername="Theresa May" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="56"  time="017:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0002.htm#160105-0002.htm_spmin35">
	<p pid="d.56.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement about our work to counter the threat that we face from terrorism, in the light of the latest propaganda video from Daesh.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/2">This weekend, Daesh released a video depicting the sickening murder of five men whom they had accused of spying for Britain. The video also featured a young boy. Let me echo the Prime Minister's words: this is a barbaric and appalling video. Daesh seek to intimidate and spread hateful propaganda, but in doing so they only expose their own depravity, and the emptiness of their proposition.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/3">The House will understand that this is an ongoing police investigation. and that I cannot comment further while that investigation continues. To do so could prejudice the outcome of any future judicial process. For the same reason, I cannot comment on the alleged identity of the man or the child in the video.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/4">Since the start of the conflict in Syria, more than 800 people from the UK who are of national security concern are thought to have travelled to the region, and we believe that about half of them have returned. Those who have travelled include young women and families. We have seen deadly Daesh-inspired terrorist attacks in Europe and other countries, including the attacks last year in Paris, Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait and Tunisia, where 30 British nationals, along with others, were murdered at a tourist resort.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/5">It is imperative that the police and security services have the resources and the powers that they need to keep us safe. Since 2010, we have protected the counter-terrorism policing budget, and, as we announced in November, through the strategic defence and security review, we have made new funding available to the security and intelligence agencies. That will provide for an additional 1,900 officers, an increase of 15%, at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, and will enable us to respond better to the threat that we face from international terrorism, cyber-attacks and other global risks. We have also strengthened the powers available to the police and security and intelligence agencies.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/6">In 2013, I updated the criteria governing the use of the royal prerogative, which allows the Government to cancel the passports of those planning to travel to engage in terrorist-related activity overseas, and in 2014 I removed 24 passports from people intending to travel for terrorism-related activity. Last year, the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act provided new powers to deal specifically with the problem of foreign fighters and to prevent radicalisation. This included a new power to temporarily seize the passports of those suspected of intending to leave the UK in connection with terrorism-related activity. These powers have been used on more than 20 occasions and in some cases have led to longer-term disruptive action such as use of the royal prerogative to permanently cancel a British passport. In November, we published the draft Investigatory Powers Bill, which is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/7">Since April last year, exit checks have been in place on all international commercial scheduled air, sea and rail services using the UK. The information this provides is already supporting our intelligence work, enabling us to make appropriate interventions. In addition, the UK has joined the European watch list system&#8212;so-called SIS II&#8212;meaning we are now alerted when any individual is stopped at a border checkpoint or by police anywhere in Europe and is checked against the system. Through our Prevent and Channel programmes we are working to protect people from being drawn into terrorism. In partnership with industry, we are working to secure the removal of extremist videos through the police counter terrorism internet referral unit. They are currently securing the removal of around 1,000 pieces of unlawful terrorist-related content every week.</p>
	<p pid="d.56.1/8">It is clear that Daesh will continue to try and poison minds, and to hurt people in Europe and other parts of the world. We must not let that happen and we stand with all those who want to stop it. Time and again we have seen people of all faiths and backgrounds join together and demonstrate their opposition to terror, and their stand for democracy and freedom. Britain will not be intimidated by Daesh, and together we will defeat it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.57.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10766" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="57"  time="017:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0002.htm#160105-0002.htm_spnew34">
	<p pid="d.57.0/1">As the Home Secretary has just said, people will have been sickened to see images from the latest Daesh video on their television screens last night. What makes it even more disturbing are the British voices in the video and reports that one of them is a UK national who absconded to Syria while on police bail for terrorism-related offences. Clearly, something has gone seriously wrong. People will rightly want to know how on earth this could possibly have happened and will want reassurance that steps are in hand to prevent a repeat</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/2">The Home Secretary has not provided that today. I do appreciate that there is a limit to what she can say, but she is only saying anything at all because we applied for an urgent question that was upgraded by the Government into this statement. I believe the public are owed more than that so I want to set out the questions that she will need to answer, if not today, then over the coming days and weeks, both on the specifics and the wider implications of this case.</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/3">I will deal first with the case itself and the reports concerning Mr Siddhartha Dhar. Whether or not he is the person in the video does not matter; the system has failed because it allowed him to abscond to Syria, and it is the system&#8217;s failings I want to focus on, rather than the identities of people in the video. He was well known to the authorities having been arrested six times on terror-related offences before being placed on police bail in 2014 and asked to surrender his passport. It was when he failed to comply with those bail conditions that it emerged he had absconded. This brings me to my first question: can the Home Secretary tell the House when she was first made aware that this individual had absconded? Did she order an inquiry at that time, and if she did, can she tell us what it revealed and what immediate action she took to tighten up procedures? If she did not order a review, can she say why she did not do so? Was he placed on a watch list and, if so, when? If not, why not?</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/4">At the heart of this case is the system of police bail for people arrested for terrorism-related activity and whether it offers the potential for loopholes. Can the</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/5">Home Secretary tell the House whether the authorities followed the correct procedures between arrest and the bail hearing?</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/6">Even if the correct procedures were followed, I have evidence that they were far too weak. I have here the letter sent to Dhar setting out his bail conditions after he was bailed on <phrase class="date" code="2014-09-26">26 September 2014</phrase>. It reminds him that he was due to surrender his travel documents by <phrase class="date" code="2014-10-03">3 October 2014</phrase>, but this letter was sent over a month later, on <phrase class="date" code="2016-11-07">7 November</phrase>. Let me quote from the letter. It states: &#8220;It has come to our notice that condition number 3 has not been complied with, or so our records suggest. Are there any changes to your circumstances that the police need to be aware of? Could you please contact the police on the telephone number listed above as a matter of urgency?&#8221; Does that in any way sound like an adequate response to the seriousness of the charges? It is clear that Mr Dhar had left this country long before that letter was sent. As I have said, regardless of which individuals might be in the video, this particular individual has absconded and the Home Secretary needs to provide answers.</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/7">I turn now to the wider implications of this episode. Will the Home Secretary tell the House how many other individuals are currently on bail for terror-related offences? Is she satisfied that their bail conditions and the monitoring of those individuals are adequate? Is this the only example of an individual absconding while on police bail, or are there others? On the question of the passport, can she say whether, in cases of this type, the authorities should seize a passport immediately rather than waiting for it to be surrendered voluntarily?</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/8">Will the Home Secretary also tell us whether individuals in terrorism-related cases should immediately be placed on the watch-list for all airports and seaports at the point of arrest? There are also wider implications about border checks, and anecdotal reports suggest that people continue to be waved through at seaports. The Government committed to check all passports on exit from the UK by the end of the last Parliament. Has that been implemented? If every passport is not currently checked, when will the figure reach 100%? Even if Mr Dhar&#8217;s passport was not checked here, it should have been checked on arrival in the Schengen area. However, at the time he went through the border, the UK was not party to the Schengen Information System, which allows the sharing of our watch-lists across Europe, because the Home Secretary had delayed our participation in it. In retrospect, does she now accept that that delay was a mistake and that it weakened our security arrangements? Can she confirm that we are now playing our full part?</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/9">We know that the Border Force has undergone a huge upheaval since 2010, involving losing staff, and that it is today facing further cuts. Does the Home Secretary believe that the numbers of border staff are adequate to the meet the threat level and that further cuts will not leave us exposed?</p>
	<p pid="d.57.0/10">In conclusion, we appreciate that this is an ongoing police investigation, but the fact that this individual could abscond while facing major charges raises serious questions about counter-terrorism policy. We need a commitment from the Home Secretary today that there will be an inquiry into this episode and that its findings will be made available to the House. There has clearly been a major lapse in security, and the onus now is very firmly on the Home Secretary to demonstrate that she is taking all the necessary action to strengthen our systems of monitoring people who pose a risk to our country.</p>

	<p pid="d.59.0/1">The shadow Home Secretary has asked a number of questions. He is right to say that I will not comment on individual reports in the papers relating to the Daesh video. That is an ongoing investigation. An initial assessment has been made, and work on it is continuing. He asked further general questions about the conditions for police bail and on checks at the border. I assume that, as shadow Home Secretary, he knows that the decision whether to place someone on police bail, and the conditions relating to that bail, are operational matters. Those decisions are taken by the police. I seem to recall that when counter-terrorism legislation has gone through the House in the past, the official Opposition supported proposals from organisations outside the House that more use should be made of police bail for terrorist offenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.59.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman asked about border checks and about whether the procedures had been tightened up. As I indicated in my statement, we have introduced exit checks. They are now taking place at the various ports of exit and in a variety of ways, according to how the information about someone&#8217;s exit is being held. We have introduced the checks and they are now providing support for our intelligence operations. He also talked about the border system that I referred to&#8212;the Schengen Information System II&#8212;suggesting that somehow this Government had delayed joining it. I seem to recall that SIS II was first proposed when the Labour party was in government, and that it was this Government&#8212;the coalition Government followed by this Government&#8212;who actually ensured that the UK went into SIS II and is now able to make use of it. We are looking across Europe to see how&#8212;I talk with my European counterparts about this&#8212;we can continue to enhance the use that can be made of SIS II. It is an important tool and we think there are ways in which we can make better use of it. We are discussing those and will be bringing them into place. We continually look to ensure that we can make any necessary moves to enhance our ability to deal with these issues, and we have done so&#8212;people can see the counter-terrorism legislation we have introduced in the past five years. We are continuing to do that, because we recognise our role and responsibility as a Government to keep people safe.</p>

	<p pid="d.59.1/1">It seems to me that the one key issue that arises from this story is whether the Home Secretary is satisfied that there is an adequately rapid notification procedure following somebody being granted police bail and where the withdrawal of their passport is included, and in the event of a request that somebody surrender their passport if they appear in court. As long as those two things are now happening expeditiously, I venture the suggestion that the problem being talked about today is unlikely to recur through a mechanism of failure of notification. Having listened to the exaggerated froth that has come from Opposition Members this afternoon, I simply add that the single biggest change is the exit checks that my right hon. Friend is responsible for introducing.</p>

	<p pid="d.60.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is right about the importance of the exit checks that have been introduced. He asks about notification in relation to when the surrender of a passport is requested. Passports will be surrendered under different powers and in different circumstances so the whole process will be carried out on a case-by-case basis. For example, when a royal prerogative is being exercised a different process will potentially be used from when a police bail decision has been undertaken. In the latter case, it is up to the police to determine the speed with which it is necessary to remove the passport.</p>

	<p pid="d.60.1/1">The contents of this video are utterly abhorrent, and we hope that appropriate measures are taken to clarify the identity of this individual as swiftly and accurately as possible. A reasoned and proportionate response to this threat is essential. The Scottish National party is committed to supporting all efforts to counter terrorism and to working to safeguard the lives of citizens of this country. If someone has a passport removed as a condition of their bail, are additional options open to a judge to prevent that person from fleeing the country? What more could have been done or can be done in similar circumstances?</p>

	<p pid="d.60.2/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her comments about the video, echoing the remarks that both I and the shadow Home Secretary made about the appalling and barbaric nature of not only the video, but the organisation of Daesh. She referred to bail that has been ordered by a judge, but of course bail will often be ordered by the police. If someone has not been charged with an offence, the police will determine their bail to return on a particular date and the conditions applied to that bail. As I have indicated, there are a number of processes whereby other measures can be taken. For example, if the police determine at the port, under the new powers that we have introduced, that somebody&#8217;s passport should be temporarily removed for further investigation, that can lead to its permanent removal through a royal prerogative being exercised or to other action being taken. The exercise of a terrorism prevention and investigation measure&#8212;a TPIM&#8212;can also contain measures aimed at preventing an individual from travelling. All of these decisions as to which powers should be exercised are taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>

	<p pid="d.60.3/1">I have formed an impression from media coverage, which may not be accurate, that a disproportionate number of violent Islamist extremists are converts to the Muslim faith. Is there any basis for that impression and, if there is, has any analysis been done about the way in which these people were converted in the first place?</p>

	<p pid="d.60.4/1">I am not aware of any figures that show overall what proportion of jihadists have previously been allied to another faith and have converted to Islam. It is certainly the case that there have been reports in the press, obviously recently but also previously, of individuals who have converted to Islam. A lot of work has been done and continues to be done on this whole question of how people are triggered into radicalisation and terrorist activity. In most cases, a number of factors come together that lead to an individual becoming radicalised, potentially to the point of undertaking violence. What we do with our counter-radicalisation programmes, particularly with Prevent and Channel, is aim to interrupt that process and stop people who have started down that route to radicalisation.</p>

	<p pid="d.61.1/1">I said that I would not speak about the individual who has been named in the press. I apologise to the shadow Home Secretary, because he did ask me about the number of people who have absconded while on police bail for terrorist offences. Those figures are not collected. Figures are collected for the number of people who are convicted of failing to surrender to bail, but those are not separated into those who have undertaken terrorist offences.</p>

	<p pid="d.61.3/1">My right hon. Friend has raised an important issue. There has been considerable progress recently in looking at the exchange of information between intelligence services around the European Union. I am talking about not just the exchange of intelligence that takes place between intelligence services, but the role of Europol. I have been talking with my opposite numbers specifically about a better exchange of information on criminal records, including terrorism offence records, further to enhance our ability to identify people who may pose a threat and to take the appropriate action. As I said earlier in response to the shadow Home Secretary, we are also looking at how the SIS II system can be improved to ensure that maximum information is available and dealt with properly.</p>

It is very welcome that, through a combination of the police and their partners in the industry, 1,000 pieces of content are taken down every week, but for that to happen those pieces of content must have been put up in the first place.

	<p pid="d.61.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. A number of initiatives are already taking place. In the UK, we hold a regular dialogue with the internet service providers. In December, the European Commission brought together EU Interior Ministers with representatives from some of the major internet service providers to discuss precisely those issues about how we can better prevent material from getting on to the internet in the first place and ensure that that material can be taken down. Here in the UK, we have had a long-standing view&#8212;across both the previous Labour Government and this Government&#8212;that we should work with the internet service providers to encourage them to use their terms and conditions as far as possible to remove material so that it is not available to promote that sort of propaganda.</p>

	<p pid="d.62.3/1">We constantly look at the measures that we need to take here in the United Kingdom to protect against an attack. Following the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> attack, discussions were held by the police with various media outlets to discuss with them their security. Of course, following the terrible attacks that took place in Paris on <phrase class="date" code="2016-11-13">13 November</phrase> last year, we have looked further at the whole question of protective security. The right hon. Lady is right&#8212;the current national terrorist threat level is at &#8220;severe&#8221;&#8212;a terrorist attack is highly likely. The decision as to what that threat level should be is a matter for the independent joint terrorism analysis centre.</p>

	<p pid="d.62.4/1">In 2014 I was very grateful to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary for increasing Prevent funding to Crawley constituency.

	<p pid="d.62.5/1">I can absolutely give my hon. Friend that assurance. We have taken a number of steps in relation to an uplift in Prevent funding that is taking place. Also, an important step that we took was putting the Prevent duty on a statutory basis. From everything I have heard, I think that is already having an impact out there and ensuring increasingly that those in the public sector who come into contact with young people and others, but particularly young people, are looking to spot the signs that somebody may be being taken down the route of radicalisation, and to take appropriate action.</p>

	<p pid="d.63.0/1">The House will understand and accept the Home Secretary&#8217;s concerns about interfering in a live police investigation, but she must surely accept that the information that is already in the public domain risks undermining public confidence in the police bail system. She or somebody in the police service today or some other time will have to give the information to the public to assure that there is no risk as a result of the operation of that system. The videos that we are concerned with today are&#8212;it is almost trite to say it&#8212;abhorrent and horrific, but they are merely the symptom of the wider disease of radicalisation. It is believed by many people that the radicalisation process is funded from sources in Saudi Arabia. Will the Home Secretary undertake today to investigate whether that is the case and, if it is, will she undertake to do what is necessary to shut off that source of funding?</p>

	<p pid="d.63.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman raises an important point about looking at the source of funding for extremism and terrorism here in the United Kingdom. There is a specific piece of work that we will be undertaking, which the Prime Minister referred to when he gave his statement to the House in November in relation to Syria. That will be done through the extremism analysis unit that has been set up in the Home Office, looking specifically at the funding of the extremism here in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="d.64.1/1">I thank the Home Secretary for yet again putting clear blue water between our fellow Muslim countrymen and those who are extremists and involved in terrorism within this country. To reinforce that point, does she accept that it would be better to pursue counter-extremism and counter-terrorism right across the country, irrespective of geographic location, race or creed? With that in mind, are there any aspects of the counter-extremism strategy that could be operated in Northern Ireland?</p>

As he knows, we have had discussions with the devolved Administrations on how the strategy should apply in those parts of the United Kingdom, particularly Northern Ireland and Scotland. Of course, work is already undertaken in Northern Ireland, in a separate strand of action, and that has been shown to be very valuable. Obviously, as he will be aware, at the moment the counter-extremism strategy that we are developing does not apply to Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="d.64.3/1">Internet-based propaganda does a huge amount to radicalise and brainwash people living in the UK into planning atrocities or travelling abroad to fight. Does my right hon.

	<p pid="d.64.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Importantly, we have enhanced the resources going into our security and intelligence agencies. He of course has a particular interest in GCHQ, given his constituency.

However, the Home Secretary will also be aware that there are growing concerns that innocent individuals and families may be unfairly caught up in the activities necessary to keep our country safe.

	<p pid="d.65.1/1">One of the chilling aspects of the latest Daesh video is the exploitation of a very young child. On the issue of the radicalisation of children, what progress is being made by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Education on ensuring that all madrassahs are registered and that all of them, even those that are unregistered, are monitored in order to safeguard our national security and our national way of life?</p>

Friend raises a matter that concerns many people about children involved in Daesh in Iraq and Syria&#8212;children who may be taken away by their families and taken abroad to that environment. In the last year, in a significant number of instances, court powers have been used to prevent families from going abroad.

	<p pid="d.67.2/1">My hon. Friend is right to point out that it was a sensible approach to look at a proper business case for going into Pr&#252;m so that we were not just making a decision based on no evidence. It was clear from the evidence available to us that there were advantages to Pr&#252;m, and I am glad to say that an overwhelming majority of Members of this House supported it. It is indeed absolutely right and it will be a very valuable tool for us.</p>

I receive regular security briefings from the police and from the security and intelligence agencies on individuals of concern and on high-priority cases.</p>

	<p pid="d.69.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the impact of Storm Eva, which brought flooding to the north of England between Christmas and the new year. I want to express my deepest sympathy for all those who have been affected across the UK. The Prime Minister, Ministers and I have visited the affected towns and communities and seen for ourselves the terrible impact that this flooding has had on homes and businesses in Lancashire and Yorkshire.&#160; I pay tribute to the tireless work of the emergency services, the military, the Environment Agency, council workers and other responders and volunteers. Many people have not had time with their families over Christmas, and they came from as far afield as Norfolk and Somerset.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/2">The Met Office confirmed today that we have had the wettest December in a century. In fact, the north-west faced the wettest December on record. Later in the month, rain fell on saturated ground, meaning that all the rivers in Lancashire were at record levels, and Yorkshire rivers such as the Aire and the Wharfe were up to 1 metre higher than they have ever been. This resulted in the flooding of about 9,000 properties, which, together with the earlier flooding in Cumbria, brings the total to about 16,000 flooded properties in England. While of little consolation to those who have been flooded, it is important to note that flood defences have protected over 20,000 properties from being flooded during December.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/3">In order to deal with the forecast rainfall, I convened Cobra meetings on <phrase class="date" code="2016-12-23">23 December</phrase> and on Christmas day. The Environment Agency, emergency services and the Army worked through the night deploying temporary defences, rescue boats and pumps, and warning and informing residents.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/4">On Boxing day, I chaired a further Cobra meeting to assess the impacts and ensure that local responders were receiving all the support required to deal with a situation of that scale and gravity. That day, I travelled to Yorkshire and Lancashire with the chief executive of the Environment Agency, Sir James Bevan, to ensure that all that could be done was being done.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/5">The Prime Minister chaired a Cobra meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2016-12-27">27 December</phrase> and visited Yorkshire. About 600 military personnel were deployed in support of the operations, with a further 1,000 on standby. The RAF played a vital role in delivering power generators to the Foss barrier in York and repairing defences in Croston in Lancashire, using a Chinook helicopter.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/6">Since Storm Eva passed, our focus has been on doing everything we can to help Yorkshire and Lancashire get back up and running. The Prime Minister announced that &#163;40 million would be spent on repairing defences, including &#163;10 million on upgrading the Foss barrier with new pumps to ensure that it can cope with higher volumes of water. We are providing &#163;60 million of help for local residents, businesses and farmers. That help has been provided in record time. Storm Eva took place on <phrase class="date" code="2016-12-26">26 December</phrase> and we made the first payments to local authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2016-12-29">29 December</phrase> so that they can help businesses and residents straight away.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/7">The speedy repair of the Tadcaster bridge is a national priority. Once we have identified a solution, the funding needed will be provided promptly. The flood recovery envoy for Yorkshire&#8212;the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11804" name="Robert Goodwill">the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill)</phrase>&#8212;will convene a meeting in the coming days with local authorities, wider local representatives and Highways England experts, with the aim of finalising a plan early next week that can be put immediately into action. That will complement the work of the floods Minister and floods envoy to Cumbria and Lancashire, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24964" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/8">Work is already under way on our six-year programme to upgrade flood defences. This investment of &#163;2.3 billion is a real-terms increase on what was spent in the last Parliament, which itself was a real-terms increase on what was spent between 2005 and 2010. It includes &#163;280 million in Yorkshire and &#163;120 million in Lancashire. In January 2015, work commenced on a new &#163;33 million scheme to protect the centre of Leeds, and projects for the Humber, Rossall and Calderdale are in the pipeline.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/9">In the light of recent events, we have commenced a national flood resilience review to ensure that the country can deal with increasingly extreme weather events. The review will look at forecasting and modelling, resilience of key infrastructure and the way we make decisions about flood expenditure. In particular, we will ensure that the Leeds scheme would cope with the new levels of rainfall we are now seeing. The work of the Natural Capital Committee, to which I have reappointed Dieter Helm as chair, will complement that. It will further develop the catchment-based approach we are now using for our environment planning, including slowing the flow upstream.</p>
	<p pid="d.69.1/10">I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing our sincere sympathy to those who have been affected by these extreme weather conditions and subsequent flooding. The Government will continue to do what it takes to get those areas up and running and prepare for future events. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.70.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for her statement and for advance sight of it. I join her in paying tribute to the emergency services and armed forces, to the efforts of the many Environment Agency and local authority staff who came back from their leave over the festive period, and to the many volunteers who helped.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/2">Last week, I visited the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for York Central (Rachael Maskell) and for Halifax (Holly Lynch) and the neighbouring Calder Valley constituency. It is difficult to convey the devastation in those communities, but our sympathy is not enough. The urgent priority, of course, is to ensure that people have a roof over their heads and can return to their own homes as soon as possible; that businesses, schools, and other local services can reopen as soon as possible; and that the infrastructure is repaired and restored.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/3">Each time this happens we are assured that the Government will learn the lessons, so I have a few questions for the Secretary of State. Why did the</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/4">Government choose to ignore warnings from the Committee on Climate Change that they needed a strategy for the increasing number of homes at flood risk, and the warning from the Association of Drainage Authorities that the cuts had put homes and businesses at risk? What action did the Secretary of State take in October after Professor Colin Mellors warned that the authorities in Yorkshire would have to look at where to discontinue maintenance because of cuts? Flood-hit communities will also want to know why the national flood resilience review was not instigated earlier.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/5">How is the public to have confidence in another Cabinet Committee chaired by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10355" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr Letwin)</phrase>? What happened to his last one, which was set up after the Somerset floods and then disappeared? Does the Secretary of State agree that it needs to be an independent review in order to have any credibility?</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/6">If flood protections are a priority, why did the coalition Government set out to cut flood spending by 10%, and why are this Government spending less this year than was spent in 2010, when, as Pitt warned, year-on-year real-terms increases are needed to keep up with the growing risk?</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/7">The Secretary of State has told us repeatedly about the &#163;2.3 billion capital budget over six years. Is she satisfied that it takes into account the impact of previous capital cuts and cancelled schemes and that it is enough, given that the Government have underestimated the climate change risk? Will she finally address the revenue budget? We still have no firm commitment on maintenance spending beyond protecting an inadequate budget.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/8">The Secretary of State is hoping to step over a &#163;2.5 billion hole in the maintenance budget. Are the Government going to commit to investing the &#163;800 million a year in the maintenance and strengthening of flood defences that the Environment Agency has said is required to protect our communities? Every &#163;1 spent on flood prevention saves &#163;8. The Secretary of State needs to remind the Chancellor of that.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/9">I note that the Secretary of State did not mention the EU solidarity fund. I would be grateful if she could clarify why the Government have so far not applied to it.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/10">I welcome the Secretary of State&#8217;s mention of the natural environment, which must be central to any efforts to reduce flooding, but I have yet to be convinced that the Government are undertaking the &#8220;complete rethink&#8221; that the Environment Agency has said we need. I would be grateful if she could tell us more about how she will work with landowners and managers on those upstream measures that are so badly needed.</p>
	<p pid="d.70.0/11">Rather than a sticking plaster response every time the floods hit, with vague promises and random numbers that are forgotten by spring, we need a long-term, co-ordinated approach. Our priority must be making sure that communities in flood-risk areas across the whole country do not endure another Christmas like this one, and that needs leadership from the Secretary of State now.</p>

	<p pid="d.71.0/1">First, we have learned lessons from previous flooding incidents. That is why we were holding Cobra meetings throughout Christmas and deployed the Army immediately to support people on the ground, and made sure that people&#8217;s homes and lives were protected and that 85% of all of the temporary flood assets were deployed in Yorkshire in Lancashire in the immediate rescue effort. That was extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="d.71.0/2">We have also learned the lessons in terms of supporting communities and those people who have been out of their houses. I saw for myself the devastation. I saw the Christmas presents by the side of the street and the very difficult circumstances that people are in. That is why, within three days, we had money in the local authorities&#8217; bank accounts so that they could help those communities get back on their feet.</p>
	<p pid="d.71.0/3">The hon. Lady talks about the long term. The fact is that under the Labour Government there was an annual budget process for flood defence spending. They spent &#163;1.5 billion when they were in government between 2005 and 2010; we are spending &#163;2 billion over the course of this Parliament. For the first time ever, we have set out a long-term programme of six years so that those communities can have the security they need. That is why we are already building new flood defences in Leeds and planting trees right across the country to help slow the flow. Those things require long-term decision making and adequate funding. The fact that this Government have a long-term economic plan means that we have been able to invest in our flood defences and that we are able to lay out the long-term programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.71.0/4">The hon. Lady asked about maintenance spending. We are increasing it in real terms. The Chancellor announced that in the autumn statement. It is &#163;171 million and it will go up in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="d.71.0/5">We are also empowering local communities. We have set up the Somerset Rivers Authority, to which the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has given shadow precepting powers. We are also working on a Cumbrian floods partnership, to make sure that the local community is involved. We are taking a long-term approach to dealing with these problems, rather than engaging in short-term point scoring.</p>
	<p pid="d.71.0/6">We have responded to the emergency very rapidly and learned the lessons of the past. People are able to get the funds to repair their homes and get back into them. That is what is important.</p>

	<p pid="d.72.0/1">I am very grateful to the Secretary of State, the floods Minister, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Prime Minister for visiting the Selby district following the dreadful floods and for offering help and support.</p>
	<p pid="d.72.0/2">The Secretary of State saw for herself last week the aftermath of the partial collapse of Tadcaster bridge. I am delighted that she has reiterated that its replacement and repair are a national priority. I have been in regular contact with North Yorkshire highways department and North Yorkshire County Council, and I know that they have been considering all the options for a temporary solution across the Wharf. Will she join me in urging North Yorkshire highways to ensure that a solution is put in place as a matter of urgency and to ensure that it has the necessary funding to do that? It also needs the funding to start the repair of the collapsed bridge, which apparently may take up to year, without delay, so that the residents of east and west Tadcaster are reunited.</p>

	<p pid="d.73.0/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for all the work he has done to support his local community in Tadcaster. I visited local businesses with him. We saw the Army, which was there to help out, and a massive group of volunteers helping out. I know that people there are desperate to put the town together again so that people can cross over to the other part. That is an absolute priority for the Government. The floods envoy, my hon.

	<p pid="d.73.1/1">I, too, pay tribute to the emergency services, volunteers, local authorities and others who worked tirelessly over the holiday period to protect homes and help families left devastated by the floods. Scotland was hit extremely hard, but my SNP colleagues and I fully appreciate that devastation was caused right across the UK. Our sympathies are with everyone who has been affected.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/2">The Scottish Government take flood prevention very seriously. However, as we have seen, exceptional rainfall still presents huge challenges. The reduced financial award made to Scotland by the Government has forced Ministers in Edinburgh to make difficult decisions. As a result of the cutbacks, the grant in aid provided to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has been reduced by 6%. However, Scottish Ministers have ensured that the flood forecasting service, which is undertaken by SEPA, has had its funding protected in its entirety. It is important to make it crystal clear that flood prevention is not a SEPA responsibility. North of the border, local authorities are responsible for it as part of their capital settlement. Councils have historically received strong support from the Scottish Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/3">The Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2009 and a further 42 protection schemes are proposed between now and 2021. On top of that, an extra &#163;4 million has been directed to support flood-hit householders, businesses and councils, including in my borders constituency. Of course, the Bellwin scheme has also been activated. All in all, that is a comprehensive response.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/4">There certainly seems to be&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> As the third party, we are entitled to make a statement. So far, we have heard no mention of Scotland. There certainly seems to be less scepticism about the actions of the public agencies in Scotland than in England. At the weekend, I received an email from my cousin Kirsty, who lives in Yorkshire. She told me that her community felt angry and powerless at what it saw as a completely ineffective response. Her message said:</p>
	<p pid="d.73.1/5">&#8220;The Tory government have completely failed us. And I believe they will continue to fail us. If it&#8217;s not in London or the Home Counties, they don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="d.73.2/1">Order. Let me try to help the hon. Gentleman by making two points. I am being very fair-minded about this. First, as he is representing the third party, he certainly does have&#8212;and rightly has&#8212;longer than Back Benchers. That has always been the case and will always be the case. I will protect his rights and those of his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="d.73.2/2">Secondly, although the hon. Gentleman probably used it as a figure of speech, he certainly does not have a right to make a statement. What he has a right to do, at slightly greater length than other colleagues, is to make some opening remarks by way of response to the Secretary of State, but those need to be followed speedily by a series of questions. All that needs to take no more than two minutes&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Order. He has taken considerably longer than that.</p>

The Foss barrier was under review at the time the incident happened, and the Prime Minister has said that he will spend &#163;10 million of Government money on upgrading that barrier to ensure that it has sufficient pumping capacity to deal with the additional volumes. In all rivers across Yorkshire and Lancashire we are facing higher river flows than we have ever seen before, and we must consider our defences in light of that. We have made an initial commitment to upgrade the pumps at the Foss barrier, and we will certainly look more widely to ensure that we are sufficiently resilient to deal with these new weather challenges.</p>

As the most flood-prone area of Britain, we have been hit repeatedly, although this time we were a little better off. Will my right hon. Friend give me two assurances? First, will she assure me that in any review, the flood defence funding that has been announced for the Humber estuary and tidal tributaries will remain in place and not be affected? Secondly, can we consider the whole policy of the EA, which seems to be about moving water as quickly as possible from the upper catchment down to people in the lower catchment in my area? We are already below sea level&#8212;water has to be pumped daily, and we need to be defended by banks that are 10 feet or higher.</p>

I agree that we need to consider catchment management, and that is what the Natural Capital Committee will be doing. We have already seen successful pilots such as the Slowing the Flow project in Pickering in Yorkshire, which was effective. We must ensure that we are putting such measures in the right places, which requires whole catchment management and analysis.

The wider solutions are a priority for the Government, and the Natural Capital Committee is looking specifically at that. We are now developing our plans for the environment on a river basin and catchment basis. That is the way we look at the environment.

Combining this with our 25-year plan for the environment, and making sure we are looking at things on the basis of river basins and water catchment, is a great priority. We need to spend Government money more effectively. We need to understand better the interactions between our environmental measures, flood risk and flood management. That is very important. This is not something that can be achieved overnight. It takes thinking over a number of years. Planting trees and putting in upstream measures takes time. Building up flood defences takes time. That is why it is also important that we have a very strong emergency response effort. We are thinking about those things for the long term, which is why we set out, for the first time ever, a six-year plan for flood defences. It is why we are working on a 25-year environment plan, so that that is in place for the future.</p>

Protecting cities such as Leeds is absolutely vital, which is why I have committed to looking at the current scheme and making sure it is adequate given the new levels of rainfall and rivers. It is important to note that in Yorkshire and the north and east region we will be investing &#163;54 a head over the next six years, compared with &#163;42 a head in the south-east region. We are investing more in the north and east of England. In fact, many schemes are happening in Yorkshire: the Humber has been mentioned, but there is also the scheme in Leeds.</p>

When the Secretary of State came to the Ribble valley with the chief executive of the Environment Agency, she not only saw the devastation but many people who do not have the luxury of choice between paying eye-watering levels for insurance premiums with massive excesses or going on holiday. The fact is that if they are on low incomes they either spend the money on living or on premiums for flood insurance if they can get it. I ask her to look at this again. We know that the new insurance scheme is coming in April, but that does not help the people who are hurting now. Can she give an assurance that she will look at the levels for people who were not insured during these floods and that extra financial support will be given to them where necessary?</p>

We saw people&#8217;s homes and possessions decimated. It is truly shocking and we will do all we can to help those people get back on their feet and into their homes. We have provided funding to the local authority and they can apply for it. We have pre-funded it, so it is now a much simpler scheme.

	<p pid="d.83.4/1">In October 2015, the Secretary of State turned down the &#163;1.2 billion Humber tidal defence scheme. In the light of what has happened and the torrential rain, will she review that decision? Members from all areas of the Humber recognised that the area needed that scheme.</p>

We have to ensure that through our &#163;2.3 billion budget we are fair to people across the country. There is a formula for making determinations, and one thing we shall look at in the national resilience review is how that formula works and how funding is allocated. Until then, we have to make sure that we are fair using the existing formula.</p>

It was prompt, and I firmly believe it has been constructive and helpful to the people of Carlisle and Cumbria.

Today, large swathes of my constituency are under water, and there was a real fear last night that the flood defences in Perth might fail, which would have been utterly disastrous for my constituents, given the flow of water that comes down the Tay. Even if we had the most robust flood defences in the world it would do nothing if we do not tackle climate change. I know that flood defences are a devolved matter, but the Secretary of State could do something for us today if she stopped the disastrous decision to withdraw subsidy and support for onshore wind. That would enable us to invest in the technologies of the future, which might protect us in the future.</p>

What businesses need now is help with those resilience measures to make sure that the next flood&#8212;there will be one&#8212;will be survivable. Many insurance companies will not fund the extra costs of resilience measures.

	<p pid="d.87.6/1">In the last 12 months, the UK has paid &#163;35.6 million into the EU solidarity fund, the second biggest contribution. We have only ever made one claim on the fund, in 2007, following flooding, and we were paid out &#163;130 million. May I urge the Secretary of State to push an application for funding from the fund? If we are not going to do that, can she explain why we pay into the fund?</p>

That was paid into the bank accounts of local councils within three days. I have said that we will look at the EU solidarity fund, but the reality is that it would take seven months for that money to come through and our priority has been responding to the immediate situation we face and ensuring that people get the support they need.</p>

	<p pid="d.88.0/1">Following the floods in 2007, the Government commissioned the &#8220;Land Use Futures&#8221; report, which laid out exactly what has happened this week. The people who produced that report said at the weekend that the Government ignored the report. They should go back, read the report and listen to the evidence. Will the Secretary of State do that and respond properly to the request made earlier by a colleague to look at the Pitt review, which said that the fire and rescue service should have a statutory duty to be the first response? Will she please answer those questions properly?</p>

Salford City Council, with the councils for Broughton, and charities such as Helping Hands, responded to the River Irwell overflowing in Broughton, causing damage to up to 800 properties.

I particularly welcome the national flood resilience review and the inclusion of transport resilience within it. In Worcester we are seeing the raising of new defences to try to improve the resilience of the city this year. Can she ensure that the Department for Transport is linked in with that review so that it can take into account the value of capital bids such as the case for dualling the Carrington bridge in Worcester for improving flood resilience?</p>

	<p pid="d.89.1/1">My constituency over the last 10 years has suffered three one-in-100-year floods, but the story has got much better with the progress of the community-inspired initiative called the Connswater Community Greenway. I encourage the Secretary of State to look at that not just because it has increased protection but because it has galvanised communities. The community recognises that Government neither control the rain nor can do everything. More importantly, they have levered significant resource from outside Government to provide the level of protection from flooding that we need. I encourage her to visit and other Members to learn those lessons, too.</p>

Similar schemes are being delivered in areas such as Pickering, and by the Cumbrian Floods Partnership and the Somerset Rivers Authority. I think that we should give local communities more power over decisions and involve them more in building up resilience, as well as paying attention to our national risk.</p>

I hope that the Government will match all those funds. However, may I ask the Secretary of State to admit that it was a false economy to cancel the &#163;250 million Leeds flood defence scheme?

My concern, and the concern of my constituents, is that the Greater Manchester green belt is up for review next year, and developers are already seeking to have plots of land on those very same flood plains removed from the green belt for development. The Secretary of State has told the House what is in the national planning policy framework. Will she now tell us clearly that she does not expect those flood plains to be taken out of the green belt?</p>

	<p pid="d.93.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabian Governments.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/2">The Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, has mattered to the UK for generations. Our relationships there are among our most enduring in the world. The Gulf is critical to our foreign policy objectives of security, prosperity and support for UK nationals overseas.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/3">Turning to Saudi Arabia specifically, the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia enjoy a deep, long-standing history of friendship and co-operation. December marked 100 years since the signing of the Darin treaty between the United Kingdom and King Abdulaziz, who founded modern-day Saudi Arabia in 1932. As hon. Members are aware, Saudi Arabia is an influential voice in the region. It is the only Arab country to be represented among the G20. As the home of Islam&#8217;s two holy mosques, it has enormous global religious influence.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/4">Today, the UK and Saudi Arabia co-operate in areas as diverse as education, healthcare, culture, defence, and, of course, counter-terrorism, as well as on the shared challenges facing the middle east. Some 25,000 Britons are proud to call the kingdom their home, and a further 70,000 visit each year as pilgrims. More than 15,000 Saudi students study in some of the UK&#8217;s world-class universities.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/5">A strong relationship with Saudi Arabia matters. Our collaboration has foiled terrorist attacks, directly saving British lives. British-Saudi co-operation has specifically resulted in the foiling of al-Qaeda terrorist attacks that would have caused substantial destruction and loss of life. An example of this co-operation was the discovery at East Midlands airport of a &#8220;printer bomb&#8221; on board a US-bound flight in October 2010. The initial alert came from the Saudi authorities, which have been quick to provide information to protect British interests on this and many other occasions.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/6">We should not ignore Saudi Arabia&#8217;s important and growing contributions to regional stability. We work together to tackle regional threats. We both want stability in the middle east. Saudi Arabia&#8217;s role in the region is essential to solving the crises in Syria and Yemen and to defeating terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/7">The Saudi Arabian Government have been at the forefront of international efforts to defeat Daesh, from which the country has suffered first-hand. The King and the religious establishment continue clearly and publicly to condemn Daesh, and to emphasise that its poisonous ideology does not in any way represent the teachings of the Islamic faith.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/8">Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries to participate in airstrikes against Daesh in Syria. It also co-leads the global coalition&#8217;s work to cut Daesh&#8217;s resources and has established the Islamic military coalition to fight terrorism. We are grateful to the Saudi Arabian Government for hosting a successful conference of Syrian opposition groups in Riyadh last month to agree a common political platform and to start to form a negotiating team for UN-brokered peace talks with the Syrian regime, due to take place in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="2016-01-25">25 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/9">The recent escalation in tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran is deeply concerning. I urge all parties in the region urgently to show restraint and responsibility, and to work towards resolving tensions. I was very concerned to hear of the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran and consulate in Mashhad on <phrase class="date" code="2016-01-02">2 January</phrase>. We know only too well the impact of this. It is essential that diplomatic missions are properly protected and respected, in accordance with the Vienna conventions. The Foreign Secretary, myself and our representatives in the region have been in touch with all sides to urge calm and to de-escalate tensions.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/10">I make it clear, however, that the UK&#8217;s close relationship with Saudi Arabia does not mean that we shy away from raising legitimate human rights concerns. We make this point very clearly in public and in private. The Saudi authorities are well aware of our views. I raised them most recently myself with the Saudi authorities yesterday, following the execution of 47 people over the weekend, 43 of whom were Sunni.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/11">As I said in my statement on Sunday, the UK is firmly opposed to the death penalty. Our opposition extends to all circumstances and all countries. We remain firmly committed to advancing the global abolition of the death penalty. Regarding recent articles on the FCO&#8217;s &#8220;Strategy for Abolition of the Death Penalty 2010-2015&#8221;, I would like to clarify that this document is a general policy guide from 2011, rather than a case-by-case list of countries where the death penalty is applied. A full list of countries of concern was published in March 2015 in the annual human rights report; that includes Saudi Arabia and its use of the death penalty. The Saudi Arabian Government are well aware of our views. We will continue to raise our concerns with them.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/12">We also raised the case of Ali al-Nimr with the Saudi authorities again over the weekend. We expect that Ali al-Nimr and the two others who were convicted as juveniles will not be executed. We will continue to raise these cases with the Saudi authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/13">More broadly, Saudi Arabia remains a Foreign and Commonwealth Office human rights priority country, not only because of the use of the death penalty, but because of restricted access to justice, women&#8217;s rights, and restrictions on freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion or belief. The UK&#8217;s position on human rights in Saudi Arabia is a matter of public record.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/14">Founded just over a 100 years ago, Saudi Arabia is a relatively young country and we recognise that change cannot happen overnight. The human rights situation in Saudi Arabia reflects widely held conservative social values and, as such, needs to move at a pace that is acceptable to its society, but we believe that we will be more successful in discussing cases privately with Saudi Arabia. We use the strength of our relationship and engagement to encourage reform. We believe that it is more effective to work with other countries to improve and reform their systems than to criticise from the sidelines. We take this approach with Saudi Arabia, as we do with other countries around the world.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/15">When it comes to reform, there has been some recent incremental progress. December&#8217;s municipal elections were the first in which women were allowed to stand and vote. Some 21 women were elected. A law on non-governmental organisations was passed in December to create an official channel to enable the formation of NGOs and charities within the kingdom, but there is, of course, much progress still to be made.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/16">Our prosperity relationship is important, but it is only part of the relationship, not our key driver. Saudi Arabia is one of the UK&#8217;s largest trading partners in the middle east, and the leading middle eastern exporter of goods to the UK. In 2014, exports of goods reached over &#163;4 billion, and exports of services in 2013 reached over &#163;5 billion. UK companies, with the assistance of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, have delivered projects worth over &#163;2 billion so far this financial year in the transport, healthcare and education sectors, but this does not come at the expense of human rights; we can, and do, raise these issues with the Saudi Arabian Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.93.1/17">Only by working with them are we likely to bring about the change we all desire. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.95.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10669" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="95"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0003.htm#160105-0003.htm_spnew38">
	<p pid="d.95.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his statement and for giving me advance sight of it. He is right to refer to the long-standing relationship between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, to our trade relations, to the vital importance of intelligence and security co-operation in countering terrorism and to the efforts that both countries are making to defeat Daesh brutality. But with the region already in ferment, with the brutal civil wars in Syria and Yemen and the threat from Daesh not only in Syria and Iraq but in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere, the Minister must recognise that the execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr and 46 other people has caused a major diplomatic and political crisis. Surely the basis of any close relationship must be that the two parties can be honest with each other.</p>
	<p pid="d.95.0/2">We, too, oppose the use of the death penalty in every circumstance, including what has happened in Saudi Arabia. But we on this side of the House believe that the Saudi Government were profoundly wrong to execute Sheikh al-Nimr, a Shi&#8217;a cleric, and three young Shi&#8217;a men whose alleged offences appear to have involved taking part in political protests and demonstrations against the current Government. The House will have noticed that neither the Prime Minister&#8217;s comments nor the Minister&#8217;s statement today mentioned Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr by name, and that is a matter of great regret.</p>
	<p pid="d.95.0/3">These mass executions have caused dismay and outrage around the world. Amnesty International has described Sheikh al-Nimr&#8217;s trial as &#8220;seriously flawed&#8221;, and reported that he was denied the most basic means to prepare for his defence and was not represented by legal counsel for some of the proceedings because the authorities did not inform his lawyer of some dates of the hearings. Does the Minister share those concerns? Can he confirm the basis on which he has just told the House that the Government still believe that the sheikh&#8217;s nephew, Ali al-Nimr, who was convicted and sentenced to death as a juvenile, will not now be executed, given that his uncle has only just been put to death?</p>
	<p pid="d.95.0/4">In the last few days, the Saudi embassy in Tehran has been attacked and there has been a breakdown of diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran and other Gulf states. This is a very dangerous moment. In agreeing with the Minister&#8217;s call for calm and restraint, may I ask what he thinks the implications of this crisis will be for the Vienna talks on Syria? What are the prospects for the urgently needed ceasefire there, and does he still think that face-to-face negotiations between the parties will start by the end of this month? What is his assessment of the impact of all this on the Yemen peace talks, given that the Saudi-led coalition, which has been bombing the Iranian-allied Houthi movement in Yemen for nine months, announced on Saturday the end of a ceasefire that only began on <phrase class="date" code="2016-12-15">15 December</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="d.95.0/5">The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is increasingly desperate, and many civilians have been killed in airstrikes. There have been reports of potential breaches of international humanitarian law by the Saudi military, which uses British-supplied weapons, among others. Before Christmas, in the light of those reports, I called on the Government to launch an immediate review of arms export licences relating to Saudi Arabia. Will the Government now carry out an independent investigation into whether there is a risk of UK arms being used in breach of international humanitarian law? I ask this because the Government say that they have urged Saudi Arabia itself to investigate any such breaches of international humanitarian law. Will the Minister tell the House what investigations have been undertaken by the Saudis, and what assessment he has made of their credibility?</p>
	<p pid="d.95.0/6">Following the cancellation of the proposed UK prison contract, will the Government now publish the memorandum of understanding on judicial co-operation signed with Saudi Arabia on <phrase class="date" code="2014-09-10">10 September 2014</phrase>? What discussions have taken place since then, and does the Minister think it would be appropriate now to suspend any co-operation on judicial matters with Saudi Arabia in the light of these mass executions?</p>
	<p pid="d.95.0/7">Finally, it has been reported that in 2013 the UK assisted Saudi Arabia in its candidacy for a place on the United Nations Human Rights Council. Can the Minister confirm whether that was the case? If it was, why did the UK Government take that action, given that his own Department&#8217;s human rights and democracy report lists Saudi Arabia as one of the countries of human rights concern, relating not only to its use of the death penalty but to access to justice, to women&#8217;s rights, and to the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion or belief&#8212;all of which this House and our country are deeply committed to?</p>

	<p pid="d.96.0/1">Before I reply to the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s important questions, may I just say that I am delighted to see him in his place today, following so much speculation? He commands a great deal of respect, and Parliament is all the wiser for his expertise in foreign affairs. I am pleased to see him back in his place.</p>
	<p pid="d.96.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman has raised a number of questions, some of which related to the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Iran. He mentioned the importance of the work being done in Yemen and in Libya and also in Syria. It is fair to say that we ended 2015 in a better place&#8212;marginally&#8212;than we started it, so far as the middle east is concerned. We had a ceasefire in place in Yemen. We had agreement around the table from adversaries from Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United States and France, and from other participants and stakeholders in Syria, after waiting four years for all the necessary players to work together and agree on the requirements for a ceasefire and a transition process and on the necessary steps to put in place an 18-month approach towards elections. That could not have happened had Iran and Saudi Arabia not come to the table themselves.</p>
	<p pid="d.96.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman is right to point out the involvement of Saudi Arabia in Yemen. It leads a large coalition&#8212;he is fully aware that it is not just Saudi Arabia that is involved there&#8212;and had that action not been taken, the Houthis would have moved all the way down to the port of Aden. The consequences of that would have been dire. So yes, Saudi Arabia has participated in the push-back, but it is following resolution 2216, as he is also well aware.</p>
	<p pid="d.96.0/4">Saudi Arabia is bringing together the opposition parties that have not been at the table at the Vienna talks, and that is absolutely critical. That illustrates the work that Saudi Arabia needs to do. I hope the right hon. Gentleman agrees that we need to de-escalate the tensions. We have had confirmation from Saudi Arabia that it wants to continue to participate in the Vienna talks, and I am pleased that the President of Iran has condemned what happened at the Saudi Arabian embassy and at the consulate. That condemnation is important if we are to see a de-escalation of tension.</p>
	<p pid="d.96.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned arms sales. He is aware that Saudi Arabia has the right to defend itself and to participate in UN-approved actions in places such as Yemen. We have in place a robust system of licensing and scrutiny. We will look at any aspect of this where we feel that UK arms have been seen to be used inappropriately. We are working to make sure that the coalition, comprising not only Saudi Arabians but Emiratis, Jordanians, Egyptians and all those who are involved, tries to follow the standards of military engagement that we honour in this country as well.</p>
	<p pid="d.96.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman specifically asked about&#8212;or made reference to&#8212;judicial co-operation under the memorandum of understanding. I understand from the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24815" name="Dominic Raab">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase>, that there is no agreement on judicial co-operation in that MOU.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160111/corrtext/160111c0001.htm#column_3-4MC"><i>[Official Report, 11 January 2016, Vol. 604, c. 3-4MC.]</i></a> We are working behind the scenes with Saudi Arabia and we are endeavouring to improve the situation in Saudi Arabia, but this country is pivotal to overall peace in the middle east. Only with agreement to de-escalate the current tensions will we see Iran and Saudi Arabia come back to the table to make sure that we can build on what we did in 2015, in Yemen, in Syria and in places further afield such as Libya.</p>

	<p pid="d.97.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that although this is a complex relationship, the Saudis are often very difficult allies and they often find us very difficult and inexplicable, too? Does he also agree that in a region racked by civil war and political upheaval, they are essential and very long-standing allies and friends, and are not just to be cast aside like President Mubarak?</p>

	<p pid="d.97.1/1">My right hon. Friend, who has huge experience in this area, makes a very important point. I made reference to the fact that Saudi Arabia is a young state, created in 1932. There was no sense of nation state before that. There was no sense of central Government; rather, there were powerful tribal structures. It remains a mostly socially conservative society, where today&#8217;s leadership is on the liberal end of opinion&#8212;we must not forget that. We will therefore continue to work with Saudi Arabia to make sure that it moves towards its programme of reforms and modernisation.</p>

	<p pid="d.98.0/1">I thank the Minister for his statement and for advance sight of it. <i>The Independent </i>recently reported that a legal adviser to the Foreign Secretary stated that it was &#8220;not at all clear&#8221; whether UK weapons sold to Saudi Arabia have been used on civilian targets in Yemen, and a recent legal opinion published by Matrix Chambers has further cast doubt on the Government&#8217;s action. I await a response from the Minister to my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2016-12-03">3 December</phrase>, in which I asked for specific reassurances from him that international arms treaty laws have not been breached in the sale of these weapons. I hope he can use this opportunity to give that reassurance to the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.98.0/2">At the same time, the Minister should explain why the work of this Government on the export of weapons and military equipment has not been subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny by the Committees on Arms Export Controls. Why have they been reluctant to have transparency on this vital matter? We must have a full explanation as to why Saudi Arabia was excused from the UK Government&#8217;s five-year strategy towards abolishing the death penalty worldwide, despite its having one of the world&#8217;s worst human rights records. Why did that happen? Following the execution of 47 people in a single day last week, does the Minister regret that decision? What representations did the Government make to Saudi Arabia before and after the execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr?</p>
	<p pid="d.98.0/3">Finally, let me say that this Government are fast losing any credibility when it comes to supporting human rights around the world. The question has just been asked, but not answered, as to whether they supported Saudi Arabia&#8217;s election to the UN Human Rights Council. What role did the Tory-Lib Dem Government play in that process? In addition, and of paramount importance, does the Minister support Saudi Arabia&#8217;s continuation in the role?</p>

	<p pid="d.98.1/1">Let me answer that last point about Saudi Arabia&#8217;s membership of the UN Human Rights Council first. The UK does not publicise how it votes, and that has been the case under all Governments, but I should say that this election was uncontested so it was very clear what the actual outcome would be. This appointment was made via an internal nomination of the consultative group, and the UK is not a member of that group. I hope that clarifies the British position in relation to Saudi Arabia and the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
	<p pid="d.98.1/2">I thought I had answered the question about the five-year strategy. I specifically made it clear in my statement that that was written in 2011 and is no longer relevant in relation to the countries of concern, including Saudi Arabia. In dealing with a point about Ali al-Nimr made by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10669" name="Hilary Benn">the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)</phrase>, which I did not answer fully, I can only repeat what I have said over the weekend, as have the Foreign Secretary and our ambassador in Riyadh: there are no reasons why Ali al-Nimr should face execution, and nor should the other youths convicted while they were juveniles.</p>

	<p pid="d.99.0/1">There should be much to be welcomed from more dynamic Saudi leadership and decision making, but not if it comes at a price of fomenting conflict with Iran. That relationship is key to conflict resolution in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and to stability in Lebanon and Bahrain. The rest of the international community is going to have to pick up the pieces and the costs if the Saudi-Iranian relationship does not have both parties trying to work towards co-operation, not confrontation. Will the Minister assure the House that the United Kingdom&#8217;s view that both countries must be working hard towards co-operation and repairing this relationship is our absolute expectation?</p>

	<p pid="d.99.1/1">I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, the work that he has done and his interest in this area. I am aware that the Committee visited Tehran recently and has first-hand knowledge of what is happening there, following the nuclear deal. That is crucial: what message are we sending to the people of Iran with this opportunity, after the cold war that they have been through, to participate more responsibly in the region? We want to send a clear and positive message to the people of Iran, which is why it is so important to de-escalate the current tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>

The Minister has painted a convincing picture of the way in which important intelligence tip-offs against Daesh are furnished to this country, but can he use his and the Government&#8217;s influence to say to the Saudis that their protestations of opposition to Daesh would carry more weight if there were less support from Saudi Arabia for the spreading of extreme Wahabist ideology through mosques and in countries around the world?</p>

	<p pid="d.99.5/1">My right hon. Friend makes an important point. We are facing extremism, not just from Daesh, but from a series of extremist operators, including the Khorasan group, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Ansar al-Sharia and al-Nusra. They have one objective in common: to harm the west. It is important that everybody recognises that we will win not on the battlefield, but by winning hearts and minds. Nothing is more important than countries such as Saudi Arabia recognising the work it can do, which it is starting to do, in persuading the extremists and everybody else who might be encouraged to join those extremists that that is not what Islam is all about.</p>

	<p pid="d.100.0/1">The executions over the weekend, including that of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, must surely raise fundamental questions about the United Kingdom&#8217;s relationship with Saudi Arabia. People in the UK have every right to want to know what arrangements we are entering into as a country with another country that has acted with such brutality and with such disregard to the impact of its actions on co-operation across the middle east, especially in the light of the Vienna process and the ongoing conflict involving Daesh. Will the Government now commit to publishing both the memorandum of understanding on security, which was signed by the Home Secretary on behalf of the United Kingdom, and the memorandum of understanding on judicial co-operation, both of which have been withheld in full despite Freedom of Information Act requests? Bearing in mind the Saudi Government&#8217;s appalling record on human rights, especially the rights of women, will the Government call on Saudi Arabia to step down from chairing the UN Human Rights Council? The Minister carefully avoided condemning the actions of Saudi Arabia over the weekend, so will he do so now? Clearly, Saudi Arabia has a great influence over this Government. Will this Government now prove that they have some influence over Saudi Arabia?</p>

Saudi Arabia is aware of our views. The UK is also committed not just to abolishing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia, but to advancing the global abolition of the death penalty. As a first step towards that objective, we should continue to work with our EU partners in applying the EU minimum standards. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Vienna talks. He seems to want to have his cake and to eat it too. Saudi Arabia is playing an influential role in the Vienna talks. Indeed, one could argue that those talks could not happen without Saudi Arabia at the table. It is very important that we continue to engage with Saudi Arabia and to de-escalate the tension that currently exists between Saudi Arabia and Iran so that we can ensure that the Vienna talks are able to proceed as expected later this month.</p>

I urge my hon.

Had actions not been taken, as I said, the humanitarian catastrophe in that country, which the hon.

A port off the Red sea called Al Mukalla&#8212;a town bigger than Bournemouth&#8212;is now run by al-Qaeda. That is the threat that we face in Yemen.

The Minister is well aware that I have been campaigning for Ali for months and also for Dawoud and Abdullah, so I call on the Minister to make sure that the Saudi King commutes the death penalties and does not carry them out.

	<p pid="d.104.0/1">I do not entirely understand the final point that the hon. Lady makes. I pay tribute to her and the work that she is doing in making sure that she raises these issues on the Floor of the House. I take all her contributions extremely seriously. She is aware that I am in constant dialogue over these cases, not just Raif Badawi, but Ali Mohammed al-Nimr and others. We have been working closely together on that and I assure the hon. Lady that we will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="d.104.1/1">Saudi Arabia is co-ordinating the Islamic military alliance to fight terrorism, a coalition of 34 nations brought together to help defeat Daesh, in addition to the Vienna talks. Iran is not one of the 34 nations, and it is difficult to imagine how that coalition will be able to grow and work effectively, given the increased acrimony and the breakdown in diplomatic relations between Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries, including Iran. How can the Government make sure that this embittered Sunni-Shi&#8217;a division does not put the stability of the region and our own safety here at home at further risk from sectarian conflict and extremism on both sides, when we need bold steps towards a Sunni and Shi&#8217;a reconciliation?</p>

	<p pid="d.104.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, who I know has huge expertise in this area. She describes exactly the challenge that we face and what we need to do. She talks about the Islamic military coalition to fight terrorism. That is in its infancy. Countries have only just come together. It would make sense for Iran to be involved in that. The first meeting took place just before the new year. Further meetings are planned. It is a positive move that countries are now looking towards the longevity of their own security.</p>

Well, that&#8217;s worked, hasn&#8217;t it?

	<p pid="d.104.4/1">I am reminded of Labour&#8217;s policy towards Saudi Arabia over 13 years. We must have clear and precise rules on the export licensing schemes around the world. We cannot do it by whim or by choice, according to whether a country is flavour of the month or not. There are rules that we follow. Saudi Arabia has the right the defend itself and to purchase weapons systems. No country has the right to purchase weapons systems from us and then abuse them or use them incorrectly. The licensing scheme then kicks in and makes sure that the sales are revoked.</p>

	<p pid="d.105.1/1">The executions last week were shocking and deeply troubling. May I place a different emphasis from that of some of my colleagues and urge the Minister and the Government only to enact measures that will be effective in improving the Saudis&#8217; record on human rights, acknowledging the dangers that bellicose statements from the west&#8212;from infidels&#8212;can sometimes make matters significantly worse in a situation where the Saudi Government themselves are fragile and could at some time be replaced by a far more brutal regime? We would not forgive ourselves, nor would we be forgiven in the country, if our actions resulted in a fundamental reappraisal of our relationship that stopped the vital intelligence that could have prevented a fatal attack on our shores.</p>

I described the leadership today as being at the liberal end of opinion in that country. He uses a different form of wording. There are huge challenges that we face in the middle east, and different ways that we can provide support and influence the country. We can use foghorn diplomacy, stand back and shout from afar.

This escalation of tension could reverse some of those hard-won victories.

	<p pid="d.105.4/1">Yes, huge efforts are taking place behind the scenes, involving many countries. My hon. Friend speaks about Ramadi. I place on record the importance of the capital of Anbar province now returning to the Iraqis. That shows that Daesh is on the back foot. The next step is Mosul. That will be significant for Iraq, which my hon. Friend knows well. It is important that that country is able to change the laws on de-Ba&#8217;athification and the national guard.

	<p pid="d.105.5/1">I think that most of us would agree that last week&#8217;s dreadful executions in Saudi Arabia reinforced the case for a global abolition of the death penalty. Does the Minister agree that it is vital that our democratic allies in the west also adhere to that? Will he strongly make the case to Americans in the southern states of the US, many of whom have a deep concern for religious freedom, that their support for the death penalty in their country weakens the case for a global abolition of the death penalty and for religious freedom worldwide?</p>

	<p pid="d.108.2/1">Do the UK Government realise that unless western powers have a consistent approach to foreign policy in the middle east, particularly on human rights, there is no hope for a lasting peace? With that in mind, elementally, what is the difference between Islamic terrorist groups beheading people and Saudi Arabia beheading its political opponents?</p>

	<p pid="d.108.3/1">What Daesh is doing is beheading everybody who does not believe in it. But Daesh is not a state, so the influence that we can have in defeating it and its ideology is well documented&#8212;indeed, it was debated and voted upon in this House. Our approach to Saudi Arabia has again been discussed here today. We are committed to removing the death penalty, and not just in Saudi Arabia; we are working with other countries to see it removed across the world.</p>

	<p pid="d.108.4/1">The dreadful events last week have made a complicated situation even more challenging and tested fragile relationships in a region where we need to see peace. What reassurance can the Minister give the House now that he is in proper contact with our allies&#8212;notably our European allies and the United States&#8212;to bring more influence on making sure that human rights are a priority and that, above all, peace is introduced?</p>

	<p pid="d.108.5/1">The two issues are absolutely related. We need to encourage Saudi Arabia and other allies that need to make progress in this area and work out the best strategy for providing that support. That is exactly what we are doing. We are also in discussion with other Gulf Co-operation Council countries, the Arab League, the United Nations and the European Union to work together on how best to support the introduction and improvement of human rights, governance, the rule of law and women&#8217;s rights as well as the important issue of the freedom of the press.</p>

	<p pid="d.108.7/1">The hon. Gentleman is asking me a hypothetical; I am not going to go down that particular road. I will say, as I have repeated, that if there is genuine intelligence evidence to suggest that weapons systems&#8212;not just in this country, but anywhere&#8212;have been abused, our robust export licence scheme will absolutely kick into place. I met representatives of a number of NGOs that operate in Yemen who raised concerns in the same vein. Again, I make the request to let us see the intelligence, then we will investigate it ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="d.109.0/1">I have visited Saudi Arabia and met its parliamentarians and Ministers; one made it clear that one was against the death penalty and called for religious freedom. However, may I ask the Minister for clarification on this point? Has he seen the article by Joseph Braude from the Foreign Policy Research Institute? He said that many of those executed in Saudi Arabia along with Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr were members of Hezbollah al-Hejaz&#8212;a sister wing of Hezbollah that has been listed as a terrorist organisation by the European Union. Some colleagues have said that there was peaceful protest, but has the Minister seen the other side of the coin, which indicates that some of those involved had taken part in terrorist activity?</p>
	<p pid="d.109.0/2">I do not know the answer; I am simply seeking clarification. Linked to that issue, has the Minister seen a statement from al-Qaeda and Daesh calling for open revolt and for people to take up arms against the Saudi Government? We have a common enemy in Daesh and al-Qaeda in that respect.</p>

	<p pid="d.109.1/1">I have not seen the article and would be grateful if my hon. Friend passed it on to me. He makes an important point about the charges against these people. I underline, however, that we do not believe that the death penalty was deserved, whatever the charge. Britain has stood by that position for some time. As an interim step, there are EU standards that could be introduced. I hope that Saudi Arabia will take heed of that.</p>

	<p pid="d.109.2/1">In ascribing a key role in the Syrian process to Saudi Arabia, the Minister is dressing a wolf in sheep dog&#8217;s clothing. Does selling sophisticated armed technology to that regime blind the UK Government to the primitive barbarism that it continues to demonstrate? Is there any excess by that regime that the British Government will not offset by scraping the barrel of political excusery?</p>

	<p pid="d.109.3/1">I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman; he has his views. I make it clear that the two are not mutually exclusive: we are able to have a legitimate, recognised and transparent arms export scheme, which includes Saudi Arabia, but that does not prevent us from having very frank conversations&#8212;public and private&#8212;about issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia and other countries as well.</p>

In February, there will be elections to the Majlis in Iran.

	<p pid="d.110.1/1">Saudi Arabia is 12th on the Open Doors World Watch list of countries where it is difficult to live as a Christian. In February last year, 12 Ethiopians, worshipping in their own house in private, were arrested, questioned and deported. In a Westminster Hall debate on international human rights in the second week of December, I brought to the attention of the Minister the issue of the 28 Christians&#8212;women, children and a few men&#8212;who were also arrested. For the record, I should say that those people disappeared into the ether of Saudi Arabia and there has been no explanation of where they have been.</p>
	<p pid="d.110.1/2">On that day, I asked the Minister whether he could find out what had happened. I am concerned about the welfare of those people, as I am about the welfare of all Christians in Saudi Arabia, and other Members are also concerned. Will the Minister take up those issues directly with Saudi Arabia and give Members the answer we need?</p>

	<p pid="d.110.4/2">The concerns about the misuse of military equipment are about where kit has been used, collateral damage has taken place and that has not been admitted to. When the Saudi Arabians&#8212;not only them; 10 other countries are involved in the coalition&#8212;have put up their hands to collateral damage having taken place, the necessary compensation has been paid. That is the correct process. Our concern, which has been articulated in the House, is whether the weapons are being used deliberately and indiscriminately to cause harm from a height and there has been no follow-up whatever.</p>

	<p pid="d.110.5/1">The Minister is simply not facing up to the revulsion felt by British people at this outrage. He should have acknowledged and condemned it at the start of his statement, and he did not. He says it is important to deal with Daesh, who are executing their cultural and religious enemies, yet we are sitting down with a state that is executing&#8212;beheading&#8212;its cultural and religious enemies without proper trial. Is it any wonder that people around the country, including members of the all-party group on the abolition of the death penalty, are concerned and suspicious that Saudi Arabia is not on the FCO strategy list of 30 countries where we are trying to abolish the death penalty?</p>

	<p pid="d.111.0/1">First, I acknowledge the work of the all-party group, which I would be delighted to meet if that would be of help in looking into these matters in more detail. This prompts the question of how we best exert influence. Do we shout from afar; do we back away from any relationship that we have, right across the piece, and expect change to happen in that way; or do we follow our current strategy, which was articulated and shared by the Liberal Democrats when they were in government as well, of being able to work behind the scenes to get elections so that women are now elected, and NGOs and charities are now represented, to allow this very young nation state to take the necessary steps towards the place where we want it to be?</p>

	<p pid="d.111.1/1">This very young nation state is about the same age as the nation state of the Republic of Ireland. I do not think we would excuse murder by the authorities in the Republic of Ireland on the basis that it was a young country, nor indeed in the nine member states of the European Union that did not exist in the early parts of the 20th century.</p>
	<p pid="d.111.1/2">We are discussing a brutal and violent outrage perpetrated by an unelected dictatorship against its own citizens, and the public record will show that the Minister chose to say that he was very concerned about the reaction to that outrage before he even mentioned the outrage itself. Given that we are dealing with a regime that has made it perfectly clear that it is more than willing to murder its own citizens, not, in a phrase that will be familiar to the Minister, because of anything they did but because of who they were, does he accept that if the rules on arms sales allow such a brutal regime to receive arms from the United Kingdom, then those rules have to be changed with immediate effect?</p>

	<p pid="d.111.2/1">Again, this goes to the strategy of how we can best influence what is going on.

	<p pid="d.112.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am genuinely sorry to take up the House&#8217;s time today. Over the Christmas recess, we discovered that the Government have stopped the long-standing practice of releasing the historical Cabinet papers to the national archives for the new year. Only a small selection of files covering the 1986 to &#8217;88 period have been provided, and those dealing with issues such as the poll tax and the Black Monday stock market crash remain secret. Given that the Ministers responsible were themselves advisers to the then Government, it is important that we know who made this decision and for what reasons, yet no statement has been made to this House. Apparently they have found a way to reduce the accountability of two Tory Governments in one go. Is there anything you can do, Mr Speaker, to ensure that Ministers come to this House to explain this decision, not just so that they are held to account for themselves but to ensure that the public know about decisions that previous Administrations made in their name?</p>

	<p pid="d.112.2/1">I thank the hon. Lady for giving me notice that she intended to raise this matter. I have to say that it is not a matter of order for the Chair but rather a matter for Ministers. As things stand&#8212;I do not think she will be surprised to hear me say this&#8212;I have received no indication that a Minister wishes to make a statement on the subject. That said, her concern will doubtless have been heard by those on the Treasury Bench and will be relayed to the relevant Ministers. Knowing her as I have come to know her over the past eight months, I am sure that she will use her ingenuity to find ways to pursue the matter through questions or possibly by seeking an opportunity for debate.</p>

Today is not a normal Tuesday, because we usually finish at about 7 o&#8217;clock or 7.30 pm but today we are finishing at 10 o&#8217;clock, 10.30 pm, or later.

	<p pid="d.112.4/1">I can answer very simply. If the programme motion is passed, there is protected time of up to six hours for debate on the Report stage of the Housing and Planning Bill. That is clearly what the Government intended in putting the motion on the Order Paper&#8212;six hours of protected time. If the motion is not passed, the answer to the hon. Gentleman, and for the benefit of the House, is that debate on the Bill could not continue beyond 10 o&#8217;clock. However, I must advise the House that in debating the matters appertaining to the Bill up until 10 o&#8217;clock, we would not do so in the order set down for consideration in the Government&#8217;s motion; we would have to proceed in a different way that would require ingenious and speedy work of an administrative kind by those within the usual channels responsible for these matters. I am glad that one such senior denizen who would have that responsibility is nodding in assent to my proposition, whether with enthusiasm or an air of resignation I will leave it for the House to judge. If the motion is passed, we proceed as the Government had intended; if the motion is not passed, we cannot proceed beyond 10 o&#8217;clock and would have to proceed in a different way.</p>

	<p pid="d.113.1/1">It is a hypothetical question, but if the right hon. Lady is asking me whether it would be open to the Government to table a different proposed order of consideration at this stage, I am advised that it would be possible. I cannot recall a precedent for it, but if the right hon. Lady is asking me whether it is possible, the answer is that, like most things, if the House were to will it, it could happen. I have to say, however, that, although the resources of civilisation are not yet exhausted, no representative of the Government Whips Office has approached me on this matter. Given that we have been on statements for some time, one would rather have thought that if they did will that, they would have approached me.

As things stand, the House is due to sit&#8212;unusually, it has to be said, and pretty exceptionally&#8212;for several hours in order to progress the Government&#8217;s business. I am the servant of the House and I will do whatever the House decrees.</p>
	<p pid="d.113.1/3">If there are no further points of order&#8212;for now, at any rate&#8212;we come to the ten-minute rule motion, for which <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25220" name="Mike Kane">the hon.

	<p pid="d.114.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Mesothelioma Act 2014.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/3">I pay tribute to you, Mr Speaker, and your amazing ability to stay in that Chair for so many hours. I regularly play football on a Friday night and the question I am always asked by my colleagues is, &#8220;How does he manage to do it?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/4">May I once again pay tribute to my predecessor, Paul Goggins, who worked tirelessly for the victims of this cruel disease? As we approach the second anniversary of his death this week, I hope the whole House will join me in extending our warmest wishes to his family at this difficult time. I also express my gratitude to my mentor and the former MP for Wythenshawe, Lord Alf Morris, who campaigned tirelessly on the issue in the other place and saw that work as part of his groundbreaking Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Bill 1970.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/5">I also want to pay tribute to Conservative Members, namely the hon. Members for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) and for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), who have taken a particular interest in the matter and given their support, and to Lord Alton, who is promoting a concurrent Bill in the other place. He has also been working tirelessly for the victims of this disease.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/6">Every year, hundreds of people gather in cities across the UK to raise awareness of mesothelioma and to call for better treatment of patients, for prevention of exposure to asbestos and for a ban on the export of asbestos to developing countries. Last July, a few colleagues and I once again attended Lincoln Square in Manchester with victims&#8217; families. Loved ones released white doves symbolising each of the victims. It was an incredibly poignant and moving occasion. The number of people attending the event grows each year. The latest Government figures show that seven new cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed every day.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/7">Next year&#8217;s event will be even more poignant because of Stuart Packard, who was highlighted recently by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. As most of us in Manchester went about our business on <phrase class="date" code="1996-06-15">15 June 1996</phrase>, the city was rocked by a massive IRA bomb. As one of the first civilians allowed through the cordon later that week to view the devastation, I wondered how there was no loss of life. However, Stuart was just 21 when he spent about three weeks working as an emergency security guard at the scene and he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in March, having come into contact with the carcinogenic dust from the subsequent demolition work. He died just before Christmas, aged 40, leaving his wife and two young children. His father-in-law said:</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/8">&#8220;This disease just came back to get him so many years later.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/9">Mesothelioma is an invasive type of lung cancer that is caused primarily by prior exposure to asbestos. There is currently no cure. Patients often experience complex, debilitating symptoms and most die within 12 months of diagnosis. There is a long time lag between exposure and the development of the disease. Although it can be as little as 10 years, the average interval is between 30 and 40 years.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/10">Most people with the disease developed it after being exposed to asbestos in the workplace&#8212;building our houses, schools and hospitals; working on our shipyards; or serving and defending our country in the armed forces. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11003" name="Kevan Jones">the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, who is sat on the Front Bench, because, working with the Royal British Legion, he secured a better deal for our service personnel who are victims of the disease during the recent passage of the Armed Forces Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/11">The UK has the highest rate of the disease in the world. Mortality rates are increasing and have more than quadrupled over the last 30 years. It is estimated that more than 2,500 people will die of the disease in the UK this year and that during the next 30 years, about 60,000 people will die unless new treatments are found.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/12">Research needs to be done to understand why certain individuals develop the disease and others do not. We know of instances where the wives of construction and shipyard workers have been diagnosed with mesothelioma due to exposure to asbestos dust on the overalls of their husbands, yet the husbands have never developed the disease. We do not know why that is.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/13">The James Lind Alliance has identified a number of priority areas for research&#8212;essential questions that need to be answered to improve the understanding of the disease and provide hope to patients and their families. We need to ensure that there is funding to take that research forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/14">The Bill offers an alternative route for funding research. Although Aviva, Zurich, AXA and the RSA have been contributing to this field, too many companies have evaded their responsibilities. We need statutory underpinning. Three million pounds a year will not dent the pockets of the companies who pay out &#163;187 million a day to their customers.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/15">Dr Robert Rintoul, who works at MesobanK, sees the importance of research not only for people living in this country, but for others around the world. He says that</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/16">&#8220;asbestos is still being used in on unsafe and unregulated way. Although the number of cases of mesothelioma in the UK will fall over the next 30 years, there will continue to be an epidemic of the disease globally and the lessons that we learn today about the biology of the disease will be used by doctors the world over in years to come.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/17">Lord Wills stated in the recent debate in the other place that the cost to the health service and society was a reason for action. Going by the data that each patient costs &#163;75,000 and that there are 2,500 patients, he estimated a &#163;5 billion cost to the UK over the coming years. That is an interesting argument, given the current focus on the financial burden to the NHS in the &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/18">Unless a change is introduced to the way mesothelioma research is funded, we will risk stagnation and endanger potential life-changing and even life-saving breakthroughs. Currently, the research relies on ad hoc contributions from insurers, charitable donations and modest funding from the Government. That unreliable approach to funding jeopardises ongoing research, which impacts not only on the British research industry, but on mesothelioma mortality in the UK. That is why statutory funding must be secured for the research.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/19">One can make plenty of salient and important arguments about the value of research, both to insurers and to the British research industry. However, the focus must remain on the people affected by this devastating disease&#8212;the workers, the spouses, the children&#8212;who currently have little hope due to the lack of treatment options available to them. For them it is essential that we seize the life-saving opportunity in front of us today.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/20">I see that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24839" name="John Glen">the hon. Member for Salisbury (John Glen)</phrase> is in his place. His father, Phillip Glen, dedicated his 50-year working life to the horticultural industry in Wiltshire until his recent retirement. He was, however, exposed to asbestos by working with boilers in the nurseries, and he was recently diagnosed with mesothelioma. I am sure the whole House will join me in wishing the hon. Gentleman, his father, and all sufferers of this terrible disease our heartfelt best in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/21" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/22" class="italic">Ordered,</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/23">That John Woodcock, Jim Shannon, Sammy Wilson, Andy Slaughter, Andy McDonald, Mr Graham Brady, Jonathan Reynolds and Mike Kane present the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.114.2/24">Mike Kane accordingly presented the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.118.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="118"  time="020:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0003.htm#160105-0003.htm_spnew136">
	<p pid="d.118.0/1">I rise to take real issue with the Government&#8217;s programming of the Bill. Not only did we have extraordinary cut-offs in Committee that at times made it difficult for the Opposition effectively to scrutinise the legislation, but we must ask why the Bill was brought back today when it had to be fitted in around four statements, meaning that we are starting the debate at this late hour. Why have the groupings been so oddly applied, meaning that little time is available for really contentious parts of the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="d.118.0/2">What I most take issue with is the huge amount of new clauses and amendments to the Bill that the Government tabled over the Christmas period. We are considering most of them this evening when seeking to determine what the changes mean for housing associations with regard to regulation and deregulation, and to large-scale systemic changes to our planning system. Most planning organisations and agencies have simply had no time to assess what these changes will mean for them or the planning system. Never in my experience of many Bills in this House have I witnessed 65 pages of Government new clauses and amendments being produced at the last minute for a Bill that is 145 pages long. That is simply appalling and means that there will be no proper scrutiny in this House of almost a third of the Bill. We wish to register our strong view that that is no way for legislation to be made, and the Government should do the honourable thing and reprogramme this debate.</p>

	<p pid="d.118.1/1">I do not think there would be any objection if the Government agreed to that, but we are in the situation we are in.</p>
	<p pid="d.118.1/2">The Bill totally misses out the necessary changes to leasehold and commonhold. Some years ago, the House passed a Bill to allow commonhold to come in. It has defects and we are going to be lumbered with more and more leaseholds being created&#8212;for over half of new homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.118.1/3">The second thing I object to is that we have not taken the easy opportunity of cutting out the forfeiture of people&#8217;s homes when there has been a little dispute over some charges. I hope that later on, perhaps in another place, if not on Report and Third Reading, the House will realise that the Government really need to get on and sort out the problems of leasehold that affect a very, very high number of property owners.</p>

	<p pid="d.118.2/1">I am very unhappy about the programme motion, merely because of the time we are starting to debate it: 10 minutes to 9. This means that really important clauses will be considered after midnight, for example on whether there can be any priority for local people when it comes to purchasing of starter homes, which is included in new clause 57. There a number of really important issues which frankly I think our constituents, who are concerned about housing and planning, would not expect to be decided after midnight. That is not grown up; it is a return to the days when I first came to this House and voted against beating children at 4 am. I vowed never to have such important votes at that time of the morning again.</p>
	<p pid="d.118.2/2">This House has modernised most of its procedures. In line with that, we should reject the programme motion. We should agree to proceed on the order of debate that we have agreed to. I am quite sure the usual channels could arrange that comfortably if the motion were to be defeated. We should defeat it and not have a debate on such important matters at 1 am.</p>

There is, at the very least, some conflict of interest in the way in which the process currently works.</p>
	<p pid="d.127.1/2">Ensuring that enough homes are available is, rightly, a priority for the Government, and I applaud their commitment to helping to ensure that people have the security of owning their own homes. Hundreds of my constituents have already benefited from the help to buy scheme. I know that many of them keenly await the roll-out of the right to buy scheme, and will take careful note of anything that the Minister may say about it. Let me, at this point, thank him for his support for the new self-build scheme that was announced in my constituency just before the Christmas break.</p>
	<p pid="d.127.1/3">The Minister is clearly committed to ensuring that the new starter homes are of top quality. Those are not just warm words; the Minister has taken action. The design panel of which he has spoken at length during the Bill&#8217;s earlier stages will play a significant part in ensuring that the plans for starter homes are of the highest quality. My new clause would ensure that the top-quality plans that he rightly endorses are turned into top-quality buildings each and every time, and I hope that he will respond to it positively.</p>

	<p pid="d.127.2/1">No one wants to see jerry-built properties; we all want to see high-quality properties being built. However, will my right hon. Friend give some indication of the discussions that she has had with providers of starter homes about the risk that the building of extremely high-quality homes will lead to a diminution in the overall number of starter homes, and to a reduction in what might be called the conventional affordable supply that is intended to meet the needs specified in section 106?</p>

	<p pid="d.127.3/1">My right hon. Friend is right to suggest that there could be a trade-off in terms of quantity and quality, but I do not think that that should be used to disguise the need to ensure that every single house that is built reaches the standards that are already in place. My new clause does not ask for higher standards; it simply asks for the standards that are already in place to be applied uniformly to every house that is built. It is not a question of creating new standards; it is simply a question of applying the standards that already exist.</p>
	<p pid="d.127.3/2">My right hon. Friend is right to raise the point, because at a time when we are seeing a significant increase in the demand for housing and the Government are attempting to ensure that more houses are built, we need to prevent further blocks from being put in the way. However, the Minister must acknowledge that the market for house buyers has changed. There are fewer local builders and more national brands. Indeed, over the last year, a mere eight companies were responsible for building half the new homes in the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.127.3/3">On a regional basis, at any one time the level of real competition between house builders is frankly non-existent. This is far from a perfect market, and the current system of quality oversight was put in place when the local reputation of a builder was critical to a purchaser: builders were as good as their last build. Times have changed, and now a buyer may have little or no choice, and little or no information to go on other than national advertising campaigns. National builders seldom employ their own plumbers, bricklayers and electricians, and use subcontractors in their place. This change in market conditions means it is right that there should be a change in the independent quality monitoring scheme that is in place so that those changes can be reflected in full.</p>

	<p pid="d.128.1/1">My hon. Friend is right to raise that point, and I was very pleased to see the Minister, and I think the Prime Minister as well, underlining the importance of encouraging more small house builders to be involved, particularly in self-build schemes where they can increase the supply of housing far faster than some of the national builders.</p>
	<p pid="d.128.1/2">Good building plans are not enough; there needs to be a watertight process to ensure that at each stage every home is built to standard. Few who buy one of the 200,000 new starter homes that the Minister is talking about today will be expert house builders, plumbers or electricians, and by definition none will have purchased a house before. If these people were buying a second-hand house&#8212;one that somebody else had lived in before&#8212;most would be relying on the professional services of a surveyor. They would therefore be relying on a professional who would give their potential new home a structural health check before the sale was completed.</p>
	<p pid="d.128.1/3">For the most part, those buying new starter homes will not have that structural health check because it is a new house, a glossy, shiny, perfect new show home that the salespeople are promising them. They therefore think, &#8220;Surely there&#8217;s no need for a quality check. There are quality checks built into the processes, aren&#8217;t there? There are building regulations set out in law, building control performance standards, independent approved inspectors whose only reason to be is to safeguard quality&#8212;in essence to safeguard the buyer in this imperfect market.&#8221; Yet those who experience problems with new homes quickly discover that too many of those quality checks are not as watertight as they might at first appear. Independent oversight of the building process may not be working in practice as the rules and regulations might imply.</p>

	<p pid="d.129.0/2">Does my right hon.

While it might a bit strong to say that the NHBC is the lackey of the large house builders, it is preciously close to being that.</p>

	<p pid="d.129.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and pay tribute to him for the work he has done in helping more of my constituents have the opportunity to build their own homes. I did not have the pleasure of sitting across from <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10594" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas)</phrase>, although I am sure we will hear his dulcet tones later.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/2">Many people who buy a new home will have problems with the house they purchase; they will have a snagging list&#8212;chipped paint, ill-fitting doors and so on. I do not deny the importance of getting such matters resolved, and the Minister may well want to address some of the difficulties people can experience in getting those small-scale problems fixed, but, as valid as those concerns are, that is not the point of this amendment. New clause 1 would ensure that every home was checked for significant defects while it was being built and at the end of the building process.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/3">Over recent months, I have received evidence from people up and down the country who have purchased new properties with significant defects from major house builders. Some of those properties have damp-proof courses that are below ground level; some have been built off their foundations; and some have roofs sitting on walls that are not structural. There are also reports of inadequate fire insulation and an absence of cavity-wall or loft insulation. Those are real-life examples of defects in houses that are subject to the current regime. Every one of those building errors should have been picked up during the construction of the house, as part of the building control process. That process exists to ensure that houses are built properly. The approved inspector is responsible for building control performance standards and is, to all intents and purposes, the professional who acts as the eyes and ears of the future buyer.</p>
	<p pid="d.129.1/4">As matters stand, however, there is no legal requirement for even one visit to be made to a new-build home during the build in order physically to check the building standards. On a new estate, a random selection of houses might be monitored and the results extrapolated as though every house were the same. This is called a risk-based approach, but in reality it feels like a lottery. The fact is that every house could be different. The subsoil across a 300-house estate can change dramatically, for example, and changes in the weather throughout the build can significantly affect materials and the way they work. The current risk based-approach creates an unnecessary lottery for the home buyer, rather than certainty. There is a calculated risk, which is not something that most buyers appreciate, and not something that most buyers would expect to accompany the purchase of a &#163;200,000 or &#163;300,000 house.</p>

	<p pid="d.130.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. This is something that we discussed in the evidence sessions held by the all-party parliamentary group on excellence in the built environment. Some of my constituents have indeed been forced to get surveys done as a result of the problems they have experienced after purchasing new houses. That might be the route that the Minister would favour, but I would favour getting it right first time and ensuring that we have a system of compliance that is overseen effectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.130.1/2">The present guidance is comprehensive, and I believe that it is among the best in the world. It is pretty exhaustive, but it is just that: guidance. The Minister&#8217;s Department makes it clear that it is advisable to make four to six visits, even to low-risk new-build houses, but that is not a requirement. New clause 1 would provide certainty that every home would be visited at key points in the construction process. The evidence indicates that building control does not always work as the Government intended it to. Buyers are under the impression that their new home has been physically inspected at each key stage and on completion by a building control inspector, but that is not necessarily the case. On a big estate of several hundred houses, only a handful might be checked. The current risk-based approach adopted by many house builders means that hundreds of houses could have no checks at all, and the current skills shortfall has led to heartache for many new homeowners.</p>

	<p pid="d.130.2/1">My right hon. Friend&#8217;s new clause seems to deal only with starter homes. She is making a powerful case for the protection of all those who wish to buy a new home, so the new clause should surely apply to all new homes and not just to starter homes.</p>

	<p pid="d.130.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but I am sure that I would incur the wrath of Madam Deputy Speaker if the new clause did not deal with starter homes, as it needs to be read in the context of the Bill. I am glad that my hon. Friend has made that point, however, because this is a problem for every new homeowner.</p>
	<p pid="d.130.3/2">As I said, the shortfall of skilled tradesmen and women means that too many new homeowners are experiencing the problems that I have set out, with inadequate work not apparent for months or even years, and not caught at a time when things could be put right.</p>
	<p pid="d.130.3/3">Some more unscrupulous builders could even play the system for short-term gain, using substandard contractors, perhaps poorly supervised, knowing that problems would not reveal themselves until after their sales targets for the year are reached, or indeed their liability ends and the new house build 10-year warranty kicks in and they are long gone.</p>
	<p pid="d.130.3/4">The new clause would remove perverse incentives and this apparent quality control lottery, and would increase consistency and transparency in the house building process. It would simply enforce the existing regime for all new homes, rather than some. It would ensure that every new starter home was checked for correct construction. I am not talking about a higher standard or a new standard, but about the same standard for every house, thus removing the lottery that is currently in place. The new clause would simply put building control performance standards on a statutory basis and require the records already kept to be made available to the new buyer, so that they could satisfy themselves that proper checks had been made.</p>

	<p pid="d.131.0/1">In the new regulatory regime that my right hon. Friend seeks to advocate, whom does she envisage funding, managing and employing this new army of new-build inspectors? Local authorities up and down the country are seeing their budgets under pressure, so this is not going to come from that side of the equation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.131.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="131"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0004.htm#160105-0004.htm_spnew7">
	<p pid="d.131.1/1">My hon. Friend is right, which is why independent approved inspectors were set up when they were, to take pressure off local authorities. The problem we have seen is that because we are not working within a defined statutory scheme, those approved inspectors can vary the way in which they work. Indeed, some could argue that there are pressures on approved inspectors to come in at a lower price or to offer to do fewer inspections because it would cost the house builders less. What I am advocating here is a level playing field where all approved inspectors would be acting in the same way, and this is firmly something that would be a cost covered by the house builders. After all, we are dealing with properties worth many hundreds of thousands of pounds, and we would want to make sure that they were going to last for the long term and not simply be subject to inappropriate and inadequate quality checks.</p>
	<p pid="d.131.1/2">I urge the Minister, on behalf of the homeowners from many different constituencies around the country who have contacted me, to listen to the arguments being made today and to respond positively to what is being suggested. With a nationwide shortage of skilled tradespeople, ever-growing demand for housing and home builders looking to keep costs low, buyers need protection afforded by the building control performance standards regime, and the work of approved inspectors is more important than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="d.131.1/3">As I have just said, we need to remove the pressure that could exist on approved inspectors to reduce the number of inspections that are made in order to cut costs. We need a robust system to safeguard the quality of what is being built, particularly given the taxpayer investment in schemes such as the starter home initiative. Of course these concerns go far wider than starter homes, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24945" name="Bob Blackman">the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> mentioned in his intervention. I hope that the Government will look to further extend the requirements in this new clause to all new-build homes. I have spoken to the Minister about this issue in recent months and I know that he has a clear understanding of the problem. I look forward to his response and an indication as to whether the objectives set out in new clause 1 could be achieved for all new builds, perhaps through further regulations. With that, I shall draw my comments to a close.</p>

	<p pid="d.132.0/1">I rise to speak to new clause 2, which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11093" name="John Mann">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>. It would place a statutory duty on the Secretary of State and local authorities to secure and promote the resilience of housing and other developments, giving consideration to the impact that new developments will have on resources and biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="d.132.0/2">During the passage of the Bill, Members have addressed the need for many new homes, the record of past Administrations and the failures of the current Government that have led to rising homelessness, falling home ownership, escalating rents and deep cuts in investment. We all know that we need the houses, and efforts to help more people into a position of home ownership are to be welcomed. New clause 2, rather than seeking to undermine the essence of that ambition, attempts to improve the proposals by building into the Bill a recognition of the important environmental context, which is to ensure that new homes and developments are not only better to live in, but place a lighter burden on the environment. If the Government are serious about ramping up house building&#8212;I sincerely hope that they are&#8212;such considerations will be crucial. Simply put, the objective of the new clause is to promote the long-term sustainability of homes and communities, requiring that consideration be given to future-proofing new developments against mounting pressures from climate change and the burgeoning demands being placed on already stretched infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="d.132.0/3">A range of policies, including the climate change risk assessment and the national planning policy framework, already support such an approach through schemes such as sustainable drainage systems that could significantly enhance resilience. Despite the supporting evidence for the utility, very few new developments are implementing those strategies. Indeed, in a letter to Baroness Trafford over Christmas, the chair of the Adaptation Sub-Committee wrote that</p>
	<p pid="d.132.0/4">&#8220;the uptake of sustainable drainage systems in new development is lamentable and the new proposals introduced in April repeat the same mistakes of the past.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.132.0/5">We must also be clear that the Bill in its current form would promote a profusion of rapid cheap building at the expense of proper planning and with no real requirement to consider any potential environmental impact. It is important that the chair of the Adaptation Sub-Committee also suggested that there is no evidence that resilience measures will affect the speed of development. I take this opportunity to echo calls for the Government to respond on that matter today.</p>

	<p pid="d.133.0/1">It is relatively straightforward. Currently, the measures are not necessarily imposed. The legislation is not strong enough to compel various changes, and I will come on to that as I go through my speech.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.0/2">It is worthy of note that the new National Infrastructure Commission has been established without a mandate for sustainability or resilience and without any commissioners with expertise in the environment. Thousands of homes could therefore be given the green light in areas of flood risk or water stress and without proper provision for resource resilience or protection of urban diversity. There is a very real risk that new infrastructure will be built without proper regard for its impact on natural systems such as the water cycle or habitat connectivity. That is precisely what the campaign for flood-free homes led by the Association of British Insurers is attempting to halt, with calls for better planning, greater investment in flood defences and a stop to inappropriate development. Indeed during Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions in December, the Under-Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24964" name="Rory Stewart">the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> suggested that we needed to end house building on floodplains. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether there will be a change of policy in that area.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.0/3">The statutory duty that new clause 2 seeks to introduce would address those shortcomings by securing a resilience objective, promoting measures by developers and those responsible for utilities infrastructure to further that goal in building homes in communities that are sustainable in the longer term. This is an important point. By promoting action to respond to pressures on the environment&#8212;be it from climate change, population growth or changes in behaviour&#8212;a statutory duty of resilience would encourage long-term planning and investment, and support measures to manage development sustainability and reduce demand on resources. That would represent a positive movement towards securing the continued viability of the infrastructure, on which new developments rely. I am clear that the proposals to speed up the planning system must not come at the expense of sensible design.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.0/4">Let us not forget that the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has already recognised the advantages that building resilient homes can deliver relative to efforts aimed at adding resilience at some future date. Those folk who have suffered the effects of flooding in recent weeks will be only too familiar with the need for adding resilience by default. The concept of resilience in this context encompasses a broad spectrum of issues that range from waste disposal to water supply management and flood-risk mitigation.</p>

	<p pid="d.133.2/1">Indeed. The events of recent weeks highlight the need for the inclusion of the new clause in the Bill. The extensive flooding that devastated both large and small communities across swathes of Cumbria,</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/2">Lancashire and Yorkshire throughout December underlines the need for in-built resilience, so much so that the Environment Secretary has committed to revisiting the modelling used by the Environment Agency to ensure its fitness for purpose following repeated unprecedented weather events, as well as committed to a national flood resilience review which will see worst-case scenario planning updated.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/3">These are certainly steps to be welcomed, and I hope the Minister will build on those commitments from his colleagues and agree to grasp the opportunity to legislate for a longer-term resilience objective in the Bill. Doing so would be of great significance at a time when cuts to the resource budget of the Department responsible for dealing with flooding are fresh in the memory and doubts remain about the equally vital issue of spending on flood defence maintenance to ensure its continued integrity.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/4">Although the Government must commit to long-term investment in maintaining flood defences to provide stability and certainty, it is high time that Ministers dropped their complacency about the need for climate change adaptation and actively put measures in place to increase resilience. David Rooke, deputy chief executive of the Environment Agency, recently echoed this thinking, saying that we need a &#8220;complete rethink&#8221; in our approach and suggesting that</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/5">&#8220;we will need to move from not just providing better defences&#8230;but looking at increasing resilience&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/6">Building higher walls will not, on its own, provide the protection that our towns and cities need. Such an approach has been well and truly debunked in the past month alone. Instead, we need measures aimed at prevention as well as at defence. Achieving this, as the floods Minister acknowledged only a few weeks ago, means more trees and woodland in the hills, functioning ponds and bogs, allowing rivers to meander, and constructing buffer zones around their banks. The Government&#8217;s own climate change risk assessment lists the various risks resulting from climate change to which our homes and communities need to be resilient, including damage to property due to flooding and coastal erosion, and energy infrastructure at significant risk of flooding.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/7">However, although new developments are to be prepared for all the eventualities identified in the risk assessment, the Government&#8217;s plans for infrastructure development pay little attention to the need to manage resource risks or the need for so-called green and blue infrastructure to support development by better bringing together water management and green infrastructure. That is worrying when continued urbanisation is drastically reducing the amount of rainfall that can soak away into the ground, meaning that water has to be actively managed to prevent flooding.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/8">Although national planning policy was strengthened from April 2015, making clear the expectation that sustainable drainage systems will be provided in all major developments unless demonstrably inappropriate, that was a blatant watering down of previous commitments. The Government originally said that sustainable drainage systems would become compulsory in all new developments from April 2014, as mandated by the flood and water management legislation, but they delayed implementation before choosing to ignore completely the findings of the 2007 Pitt review and cancelling plans for the approval bodies that would have been established by local authorities. Will the Minister tell the House what proportion of new developments now include sustainable drainage systems?</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/9">Exemptions and opt-outs currently apply to smaller developments, allowing many to go ahead without sustainable drainage. The Government stopped short of implementing the Pitt review recommendation to remove developers&#8217; automatic right to connect new homes to the public sewer system, which provides an incentive for them to include sustainable drainage.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/10">The provisions in new clause 2 would ensure that local authorities and the Secretary of State take the positive steps necessary to promote resilience and protect against such damage in future. A failure to address the issue, however, and choosing to push ahead with non-resilient development is likely to increase costs in the economy, not to mention ruining people&#8217;s homes and livelihoods at the same time as threatening critical national infrastructure. It is therefore vital that as the area of urban development grows, sufficient green space and wetland must be incorporated to support nature and to manage flood risk both in any new developments and downstream. With the failure of the existing framework to encourage developers to pursue such strategies freely, it is right that mechanisms should be put in place to compel developers to create more places for trees, shrubs and grass to flourish&#8212;to create what engineers in the field term &#8220;hydraulic roughness.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/11">Today the Government have a chance to add a vital part of the system: the management of water in our communities. Many hon. Members will have seen the story of the north Yorkshire town of Pickering, which used natural flood defences to protect itself when traditional concrete options were too expensive. At a tenth of the cost, the people of Pickering were protected by investing in natural resilience. We should incorporate that objective in all our new developments. Although added resilience is certainly no guarantee that such flooding will not occur, there is popular concurrence that the absence of such features compounds and intensifies these events.</p>
	<p pid="d.133.2/12">Ministers will recognise what new clause 2 would achieve. I hope that it will be accepted, or that we will hear alternative proposals from Ministers on how to address the specific issues I have raised today. We owe it to the country and, in particular, to every individual and family who have suffered in recent weeks.</p>

	<p pid="d.135.0/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this debate on new clause 1, which was introduced by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase>, whom I thank for her generous and heartfelt words. Before going any further, I draw Members&#8217; attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests; I have an interest in that I still give advice to developers.</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/2">I am also chairman of the all-party group for excellence in the built environment, which, along with my right hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, is currently conducting an inquiry into the quality of new build. Although I have no wish to prejudge or predict the report&#8217;s recommendations, I want to explain a little about why we have launched the inquiry. I remind the House that I am also probably one of the only Conservative</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/3">Members who represents a totally inner-city seat&#8212;the only thing I have that resembles a field is a muddy meadow called the Ponderosa pony sanctuary.</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/4">I am keen to pay tribute to the previous Labour Government for embarking upon a great deal of regeneration in the Devonport part of my constituency. Like most of Plymouth, Devonport was badly bombed by the Luftwaffe during the Blitz. The city fathers quickly put up new housing to accommodate the many homeless in the city but, as Members can imagine, its quality was not fantastic. After all, it was erected after the war, so with very little money.</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/5">I am delighted that the coalition and Conservative Governments have continued with the previous Government&#8217;s housing initiative. The Government ensured that there would be a mix of both municipal and private market housing, which is important as it has changed the demographic profile of the ward. I am delighted that the Government have set themselves a target of building 200,000 new homes by 2020. Oddly enough, that is the year when we will celebrate the anniversary of the Mayflower leaving the great city of Plymouth in order to found the American colonies.</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/6">I am very keen that we should have good-quality design in any new housing. The vast majority of the new builds are perfectly acceptable. However, I am surprised at the number of new builds in my constituency that are already showing mould after just five years. I am also surprised by the number of constituents who have beaten a path to my constituency surgery because they have problems with the quality of their housing. In the main, the developers have agreed to take up those cases, but they are very aware that they have to be careful; they want to ensure that they do not find themselves legally liable.</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/7">There has been some confusion as to who is responsible for sorting out those problems. Is it the council? Should it have signed off on the development before it was sold? Where do the insurers fit in? What happens if the consumer, who has paid good money for the property, cannot get a satisfactory answer? Who should consumers go to if they cannot get redress? We need to remember that this is probably the biggest investment that individuals&#8212;our constituents, and probably ourselves&#8212;will make in their lifetime. I hope that our report on the built environment will deal with those issues and suggest some recommendations on how the inspection regime can be improved and strengthened.</p>
	<p pid="d.135.0/8">Finally Madam Deputy Speaker, you cannot expect me to give up an opportunity to raise how development can be environmentally friendly. Developers need to play a part in helping to save&#8212;you&#8217;ve got it&#8212;the hedgehog. We need to make sure that hedgehogs can move between gardens. I ask the Government to give advice to local authorities on how to develop a hedgehog superhighway. Members should remember that my hedgehog campaign is not just for Christmas, and nor should quality new builds be. We need to make sure that we avoid building the slums of tomorrow. I support the spirit of new clause 1, but I am keen to wait until the all-party group has produced its report before the changes are enacted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.136.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11923" speakername="Tim Farron" colnum="136"  time="021:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0004.htm#160105-0004.htm_spnew14">
	<p pid="d.136.0/1">The Bill comes at the right time&#8212;in the midst of a national housing crisis&#8212;but unfortunately it does not provide the right solution. It is clear that Britain needs more affordable homes, both to rent and buy, and a huge increase in the supply of homes. Yet the Bill gives billions of pounds to a relatively small number of people through the extension of right to buy while prioritising a relatively small number of better-off renters through so-called starter homes, rather than supporting the much larger number of people for whom saving for a deposit, even for a starter home, seems like a pipe dream.</p>
	<p pid="d.136.0/2">The purpose of my amendment 110 is to ensure that new homes built under the starter homes initiative are genuinely affordable and include social rented homes. Unamended, this Bill threatens an even worse crisis for those in need of an affordable home to rent or buy in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="d.136.0/3">As it stands, the starter homes initiative will merely allow a few people to access those homes at the cost of losing about 300,000 new genuinely affordable homes that would have been secured through planning gain. The policy is bad and based on the wrong priorities. In addition, the sale of social rented homes will further exacerbate the situation. It is expensive. The National Housing Federation estimates the cost at &#163;11.6 billion. It is unfair for private renters, who have been paying market rents for many years and do not have the luxury of a &#163;100,000 discount on buying a home. Given the Bill&#8217;s current lack of safeguards for replacements and the funding mechanism through the sale of council homes, the policy will lead to a reduction in affordable homes. I would like the provision to be removed from the Bill when we discuss the matter later.</p>
	<p pid="d.136.0/4">On amendment 110, we should ensure that new starter homes are genuinely affordable and meet the needs of the community in which they are built. They should be mixed-tenure, including shared ownership and social rented homes. In rural communities such as mine in south Cumbria, we should ensure that there are planning controls for newly built properties to prevent them from slipping into the second-home market, undermining the sustainability of our communities and pushing up house prices for local people.</p>
	<p pid="d.136.0/5">The Government must recognise the differential impact of their proposals across the country. In places such as London, the west country, Northumberland and Cumbria, the forced selling off of high-value council homes will reduce the supply of affordable homes in the very places where they are needed most: where high rental prices push out those who work locally on low incomes, often causing them to travel long distances with unaffordably high travel costs to reach work or forcing them to give up work altogether. It is absolutely the wrong thing to do and puts a crippling financial burden on councils already struggling to cope with reduced budgets.</p>
	<p pid="d.136.0/6">My amendment relates to the Bill&#8217;s impact on the supply of affordable homes through the inaccurately titled starter homes proposal&#8212;in particular, the fact that the starter homes will replace a larger number of other forms of affordable homes to rent and buy, including shared ownership, resulting again in a squeezing of the availability of homes for lower-income renters. A policy similar to the starter homes proposal would be deserving of support as long as those homes were kept below market value in perpetuity, which is essential so that the benefits of starter homes are passed on to future buyers. However, they should be in addition to, not instead of, other forms of affordable homes that meet different needs. Consequently, councils should have a duty to promote all forms of affordable tenures in new developments and not exclusively the Government&#8217;s narrow, mostly unaffordable definition of a starter home.</p>

	<p pid="d.138.0/1">The hon. Gentleman talks about the affordability of starter homes, and I refer to a development in my constituency, in Penwortham&#8212;a place that he knows very well, because it is where he grew up. Much of this debate has been London-centric. In the vast majority of the country, starter homes are affordable to working people, and that is why this initiative is very popular with all our constituents.</p>

	<p pid="d.138.1/1">I am particularly grateful to have given way to my dad&#8217;s MP. On affordability, we all started somewhere. We might be fortunate enough to be homeowners, but people who are only just a bit younger than me belong to a generation where the average earner cannot afford to buy a home of any kind, so a starter home is a great blessing wherever it may be. I am not arguing against starter homes, but against a narrow definition whereby they are built at the cost of a larger number of genuinely affordable homes across the country. That is what my amendment seeks to address.</p>

	<p pid="d.138.2/1">There is a fallacy that the hon. Gentleman adumbrated again when he said &#8220;at the cost of&#8221;. Why &#8220;at the cost of&#8221;? Why cannot local councils establish, grow and promote mutual housing co-operatives?</p>

	<p pid="d.138.3/1">I am in favour of those things too, but our understanding is that the starter homes initiative comes at the expense of&#8212;displaces&#8212;a larger number of homes built under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 through other forms of planning gain. That is what the Government have stated since the election and since this Bill became a subject of discussion.</p>
	<p pid="d.138.3/2">I am not somebody who ideologically takes a view in favour of private or publicly provided housing; in fact, my great problem is that too many people in this debate do take an ideological view one way or the other. I want to solve the crippling housing crisis in this country. That means building 3 million homes over the next 10 years, and to achieve that, the majority will have to be what we would refer to as affordable homes&#8212;social rented homes, shared ownership homes, and other homes with some form of restriction that allows them to be affordable to people on average incomes.</p>

	<p pid="d.138.6/1">Does not the hon. Gentleman understand that the word &#8220;affordable&#8221; is deeply tendentious&#8212;deeply laden? The reason things are not affordable is that there is not enough supply. Fix the supply, and we fix the affordability. It is perfectly possible to have exception sites for mutual housing co-operatives, or for self-build, which could be done on a large scale. Some 50% or 60% of housing is done that way in big countries such as Germany and France, and it could be done here. All it needs is a bit of imagination.</p>

	<p pid="d.139.0/1">The hon. Gentleman preaches to the converted. It is about supply and demand, but it is not as simple as that. House prices have tripled or quadrupled over the past generations while incomes have not, so it cannot be merely about supply and demand: we need to do something else as well. That is why it is wise to be involved in the marketplace in a way that does not just allow the market to rule. If we are to go through a process of setting up new starter homes, which the Government may build themselves according to the Chancellor&#8217;s statement earlier this week&#8212;I would welcome that&#8212;we have to recognise that unless we put restrictions on the value of those homes we will simply kick the problem five years down the road.</p>

	<p pid="d.139.1/1">Has the hon. Gentleman considered the possibility that, if housing and planning policy is ideologically left to developers, they will have a natural tendency to build more expensive properties, for which they will get more money? I do not blame the developers for that, but that would be the consequence of leaving it to be determined by their needs.</p>

	<p pid="d.139.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fine and correct point. I do not blame the developers, either. In a market situation, they sell what they can at the price they can get. In my community, one in seven homes are not lived in. I am talking not about holiday lets, but about second homes bought by people away from the area who earn significant incomes and can afford to buy several properties as investments or boltholes, and good luck to them. In such a marketplace, it is blindingly obvious that there needs to be intervention. That is why there is a role for social rented housing and why our amendment to improve the Government&#8217;s starter homes proposals is completely wise.</p>

	<p pid="d.139.3/1">I say gently to the hon. Gentleman that it was regrettable that the Liberal Democrats did not provide anyone to sit on the Bill Committee. He may need to review that. He probably views policy through the prism of South Lakeland, which I would have thought is a unique place in the north-west of England. The information we were given by expert witnesses was that the cumulative impact of the Bill would be to deliver a larger number of affordable homes. We received no evidence whatsoever that the new starter homes would not be affordable to people on average incomes on the line between the Bristol channel and the Wash</p>

	<p pid="d.139.4/1">If I thought there was no merit whatsoever in the proposal, I would have tabled an amendment to scrap it altogether. The point, however, is that in different parts of the country, including in the north of England&#8212;not just Cumbria, but Northumberland and parts of the Yorkshire dales&#8212;in the west country and in London, which are significant proportions of the country, the homes are unlikely to be affordable to anybody on anything like an average wage. They may be affordable in other parts of the country, in which case the Government have nothing to fear from accepting my amendment.</p>
	<p pid="d.139.4/2">In moving towards a conclusion, I am genuinely deeply concerned about the effect this Bill will have not just on those areas I have mentioned, but on others as well, particularly with regard to right to buy.</p>

	<p pid="d.140.4/1">Conservative Members would be very interested to hear the hon. Gentleman answer his own question. He told the House a moment ago that it is not solely&#8212;I think that was the phrase he used&#8212;supply and demand that affects the price of a house. What other things does he think add to it?</p>

	<p pid="d.140.5/1">I have already given my view on that&#8212;it is blindingly obvious, really. Supply and demand plays a significant and critical part, which is one of the reasons I am very proud that my council in South Lakeland has already built 1,000 affordable homes and has plans to build another 5,000. Why do things other than supply and demand have an impact? The answer is that property is a clear investment and people with enough money will buy more than one. Indeed, my constituency is strewn with such properties.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.5/2">In conclusion, my worry is that in 10 years&#8217; time, the housing crisis will be even worse, with thousands of affordable homes having been sold off, some converted to buy-to-let properties and very few replaced, at the same time as waiting lists for homes soar and homelessness rises. Poor housing is a barrier to success in life, and that impacts not only on individuals, but on communities and wider society. That is why it is essential for families across Britain&#8212;and, indeed, for our economic ambitions as a country&#8212;that we ensure that everyone has a decent and affordable place to live.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.5/3">It is often said in polite society that the most stressful thing in life is moving home, because of the insecurity, the uncertainty and the cost. Well, welcome to the reality of everyday life for millions of people in Britain who do not, and cannot aspire to, own their own home. Millions of families live with the financial, psychological and emotional burdens that inadequate, insecure and unaffordable housing brings. The Bill deliberately misses the opportunity to help those people in order to settle old ideological scores and ride some pretty ropey old hobby horses. Doing nothing in the face of this housing crisis would be bad enough, but by actively promoting a Bill that will make the crisis worse, the Government are ensuring that their legacy will be scorned by the future generations that the Bill betrays.</p>

	<p pid="d.140.6/1">I shall be mercifully brief. I have great respect for <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase>, but I do not agree with his analysis of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/2">Clause 3(1) states:</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/3">&#8220;An English planning authority must carry out its relevant planning functions with a view to promoting the supply of starter homes in England.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/4">I rise to support amendment 1, which I tabled and which has support throughout the House. After the words &#8220;starter homes&#8221;, it would add</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/5">&#8220;or alternative affordable home ownership products, such as rent to buy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/6">I have been involved in social housing since 1989, when I was the chairman of Plymouth City Council&#8217;s housing committee. Even then we had policies on hedgehogs in Plymouth. The harsh reality is that under any colour Government and any kind of council, there has always been more demand for social affordable housing to rent than there has been supply. That continues today and will probably always be with us. It is our obligation, in every generation, to do our best to meet that demand and provide good quality social affordable housing to rent for the many people who require it.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/7">We face a new crisis in this country today that is completely different from what we faced when I was involved in housing back in the 1980s. It is the crisis of home ownership and the inability of many younger people to own their own homes. We know that 85% of people still aspire to do so. I bought my first house when I was 23. The average age of a first-time buyer is now 38. This is a genuine crisis&#8212;generation rent&#8212;and the Government have my support in seeking to tackle it by supplying more affordable homes to buy.</p>
	<p pid="d.140.6/8">I strongly support the big push by the Government to build more homes, especially starter homes with a 20% discount. I also support the challenging targets the Government have set themselves to meet that need throughout the Parliament. I agree that planning authorities should promote the supply of starter homes, although I argue strongly&#8212;this is the thrust of my amendment&#8212;that the Bill should refer to starter homes and other rent to buy products as well. That would help us to move towards the goal that we all want to reach: more young people owning their own homes.</p>

	<p pid="d.141.0/1">I strongly support my hon. Friend&#8217;s two amendments, which relate to the same point. Does he agree that the crucial point is that his amendments would not only help the Government to deliver the additional homes we all want to see, but widen the pathways towards that end?</p>

	<p pid="d.141.1/1">My hon. Friend puts the case much more eloquently than I ever could. Indeed, he used the favourite word of the moment: pathway. We heard it a lot earlier this afternoon and it is a very commendable word. I agree entirely with him.</p>
	<p pid="d.141.1/2">The point of the schemes that I am promoting is not that they give an option to buy, nor that that there is a wish or aspiration that the incoming tenant will perhaps buy one day. The whole basis on which the schemes are set up is that the incoming tenant or occupant of the property will buy it and, within five, 10, 15 or 20 years, will be a homeowner. These products help to fulfil the aspirations of people who cannot get there right now and help the Government to meet their targets over a period of time. As far as I am concerned, they are a win-win.</p>
	<p pid="d.141.1/3">There are new rent to buy products on the market. Rentplus has its headquarters in Plymouth, which is why my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24898" name="Oliver Colvile">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver Colvile)</phrase> and I support it so strongly. It has brought forward a product that has attracted a lot of private investment. It is interested in setting up schemes that attract people in bands C and D on the housing needs register. We know from our constituency surgeries that people in bands C or D do not often get the house that they go for. This product is helping people who are on the homeless register to rent their property to begin with, but to agree at the outset&#8212;here is the beauty of the scheme&#8212;that within five, 10, 15 or 20 years&#8212;whatever they think they can manage&#8212;they will buy that property. They are gifted a 10% deposit by the scheme to make that purchase possible. It is a very innovative scheme and the kind of product I am sure the Government would want to promote.</p>

	<p pid="d.142.0/1">Like me, my hon. Friend will support localism. However, it is currently within the gift of a local planning authority to introduce a local plan or county structure plan, or the capacity to develop staircasing or intermediate tenure. With all due respect, the amendment is slightly onerous.</p>

	<p pid="d.142.1/1">I do not agree because it is important that these schemes are given the kind of Government backing that the amendment would ensure. Developers will not need to negotiate and explain their case to every individual planning authority, because they will know that they have the backing of someone as significant as the Housing Minister. If that wording is included in the Bill it will give those schemes a flying start and help us to meet the Government&#8217;s challenging targets.</p>
	<p pid="d.142.1/2">In conclusion, I believe that this amendment is a win-win, and I hope the Minister will think seriously about adding it to the Bill. If that cannot be done on Report, I hope that serious thought will be given to including it in another place. I do not see a downside to this; I see only more young people meeting their aspirations to own their own homes in our country in years to come.</p>

	<p pid="d.142.2/1">I rise to speak to amendments 31 to 35, 37 to 39, 40 to 45 and 46, although given the time available, it is most unlikely that I will get to speak to them all. I start by welcoming new clauses 1 and 2. They seem to be sensible measures and I hope the Minister will take them on board.</p>
	<p pid="d.142.2/2">Amendment 31 would</p>
	<p pid="d.142.2/3">&#8220;change the purpose of the Bill to one that would enable the supply of more housing across all tenures rather than just starter homes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.142.2/4">As we argued continually and strongly in Committee, the Bill is a huge waste of an opportunity to get the housing that we so desperately need across all tenures to solve our housing crisis. The Government have so far dismissed evidence from charities such as Shelter, which has said that these measures are unwise, but perhaps they will take note of <i>The Economist</i>, which argued that this policy would have &#8220;unhappy distributional consequences&#8221;, and fewer homes to rent for low-income families&#8212;the same families who cannot afford the deposit on so-called starter homes. As a result,</p>

	<p pid="d.143.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman will know because he sat through the Committee stage, evidence from Shelter suggests that starter homes will be unaffordable to people on low incomes in 98% of the country, and unaffordable to those on middle incomes in 58% of the country. For that reason we think that local authorities should have more flexibility to deliver other forms of affordable housing alongside starter homes.</p>

	<p pid="d.143.2/1">On affordability, does my hon.

Members: &#8220;Up to &#163;450,000!] In central London it is inconceivable that many, if any, of those properties will cost under &#163;450,000.

	<p pid="d.143.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point that we reiterated again and again in Committee, but alas the Minister took no notice.</p>
	<p pid="d.143.3/2">These concerns are spread across all parties and are reflected in the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron), for South West Devon (Mr Streeter) and for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas). We broadly support those amendments, as they very much back up the arguments we made in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.143.3/3">In Committee, we attempted to point out very clearly to the Government that we need to build houses across all tenures if we are to address the housing crisis. The largest number of houses we built recently was the 214,000 houses built in 2006-07, but that compared unfavourably with 1969 when 357,000 houses were built. What that demonstrates is that if we are to get something like the 250,000 homes we need, about half of them should be delivered by the public sector. However, there are simply no measures in the Bill to produce those much needed public sector homes. That is why we have tabled amendment 31 on Report.</p>
	<p pid="d.143.3/4">Amendment 32 seeks to ensure that additional housing is supported with adequate infrastructure. This is a really important amendment.</p>

Does she not think that tonight, in the Minister&#8217;s wind-up to this group of amendments, there might be an opportunity for him to update us on the progress he has made on offering local authorities useful guidance on how more mutual co-operative housing stock can be built?</p>

	<p pid="d.144.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically unfair. Many Labour Members argued strongly for more co-operative housing. In fact, I am sure the hon. Gentleman is very well aware that we had a whole section on the Lyons review that addressed this very topic. I think we are doing our bit.</p>
	<p pid="d.144.1/2">Amendment 32 is really important. Indeed, the Minister himself acknowledged on a number of occasions that not only do we need homes as places to live in, but that they need to be built in communities that people want to live in. New homes have to be supported with the right infrastructure so that those who rent or purchase them have access to good quality healthcare, schools, further and higher education, transport links, employment and so on. It would be very useful to hear from the Minister this evening what he intends to do to address the concerns raised by a number of local authorities, including Milton Keynes, which pointed out that, because of the lack of community infrastructure levy applied to starter homes, there is a very real risk there will not be enough money available to support the infrastructure that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="d.144.1/3">Amendment 33 would ensure that starter homes are affordable at locally determined rates of income and on a multiple of median incomes within the local area, rather than set centrally, which puts the homes out of the reach of many people, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10075" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck)</phrase> said. Homes that are priced at &#163;250,000 outside London or &#163;450,000 in London are simply unaffordable for too many people.</p>
	<p pid="d.144.1/4">Amendment 34 seeks to exclude buy to let property from the definition of a starter home. In Committee, we thought this was a really, really important issue to address. We assumed the Government&#8217;s intention is for these to be starter homes for people and not starter homes for landlords. In Committee, we did not get the assurances we sought from the Minister. This is a straightforward amendment, and we would like to hear how he intends to give us the reassurances he indicated in Committee he would. At the moment, nothing has come forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.144.1/5">Amendment 35 would limit the provision of starter homes to exception sites, as previously announced by the Government. In Committee, we sought to elicit from them an explanation of why their policy on starter homes changed so drastically between March and May last year, but we did not get a satisfactory response about why they had gone from being available only on exception sites to being available on almost all sites. It would be good to have an update from the Minister on that point.</p>
	<p pid="d.144.1/6">Amendment 37 would ensure that a proportion of starter homes are available to local people, which, in Committee, we thought was a really important issue. We all know that one reason local people sometimes object to new housing is that they think it is not for people like them and their families. We would like some priority given to helping people get on the housing ladder locally. Amendment 38 asks that the price cap, currently set at &#163;250,000 and &#163;450,000, could be amended only after consultation with relevant local authorities and the Mayor of London. We were terribly concerned, at several points in Committee, that the Bill transferred huge powers to the Secretary of State and contained exceptionally centralising measures. There are a number of them, but we thought his having the ability to alter the price cap without consulting anybody was totally unreasonable. The amendment simply asks that the price cap can be altered only if the relevant local authorities and&#8212;in London&#8212;the Mayor of London are consulted.</p>
	<p pid="d.144.1/7">Amendment 39, another extremely important amendment, asks that the discount on starter homes remain in perpetuity. In Committee, we asked the Minister why he had rejected the outcome of his own consultation exercise on starter homes and why the discounts were not being applied in perpetuity. The Government&#8217;s plan for starter homes is that they could be resold or let at open market value after the initial sale. The majority of respondents to the consultation elected for an in-perpetuity discount: 75% of local authorities, 100% of lenders and 50% of developers thought for all sorts of reasons&#8212;not least because it is hard to price a product that is going to change like this one will under the current provisions&#8212;that there should be an in-perpetuity discount. It would be good to hear why he does not accept that. We feel very strongly about this, so, depending on his response, we might press the amendment to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="d.145.0/1">What estimate has the hon. Lady made of the loss in the number of homes built?

	<p pid="d.145.1/1">I do not accept the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s logic. The new starter homes would be coming up for resale, as well as the additional starter homes still being built, so I am not quite sure of his logic.</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/2">Amendment 40 would ensure that local authorities can ask for planning gain measures providing for a range of affordable homes, rather than just starter homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/3">Amendment 41 suggests that the Government should really ask local authorities to provide a full assessment of housing need in the area and then to deliver the number of homes that meet that housing need, rather than prioritising starter homes above all other types of affordable housing. It does not seem to us that the Government are proposing a sensible measure here, and again we need to hear from the Minister why he is moving away from the NPPS requirement to ensure a full assessment of housing need locally and subsequently that local authorities plan to meet it rather than go off at a particular tangent.</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/4">Amendment 42 is designed to secure an exemption from the requirement &#8220;to promote starter homes&#8221; where a site has a scheme that is either a &#8220;build to rent&#8221; scheme or one that contains some other sort of</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/5">&#8220;supported housing for younger people, older people, people with special needs and people with disabilities&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/6">for example&#8212;or otherwise one that contains a &#8220;homeless hostel&#8221;, &#8220;refuge accommodation&#8221; or &#8220;specialist housing&#8221;. This is another very important amendment because we feel these sites could be exempted from the requirement to promote starter homes on the grounds that they already delivering a scheme that brings about enormous community benefits.</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/7">Amendment 43 asks for information about starter homes to be displayed on a local authority&#8217;s website and updated annually. It should also be put in the context of all other types of housing being built in an area. To provide an example, there might be 640 starter homes produced in an area, but how many affordable homes that are social homes for rent might actually have been built? We think that people need a full range of information about the type of housing and the applicable tenure in order to make sense of starter home information.</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/8">Amendment 44 is designed to ensure that the land set aside for starter homes</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/9">&#8220;is not needed for employment, retail, leisure, industrial or distribution use.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/10">It is important for ensuring that starter homes do not crowd out other forms of development.</p>
	<p pid="d.145.1/11">Amendment 45 would remove clause 6 from the Bill, as we think it is an imposition on local authorities, which takes away important community rights to have a say about what is happening in an area, while amendment 46 would ensure that in moving to promote self-build, the cost of servicing plots is not unreasonable for local authorities.</p>

	<p pid="d.146.3/1">It was longer than one of Britney Spears&#8217;s marriages&#8212;that is what I wanted to say, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="d.146.3/2">What was depressing about our Committee sittings was the conservative nature of the debate and the stasis of what we got from the Labour party, which did not move on. If there is a housing crisis, we need to find radical ways forward to deal with it. It is not as if we are leaving it simply to the private sector. This week&#8217;s announcement of the building of 13,000 units on public sector land provides an example of where we are using the might of Government to work with the private sector to deliver. To appreciate that, one needs to look only at Help to Buy, Help to Buy ISAs and other Government initiatives to help small and medium-sized builders, for instance.</p>
	<p pid="d.146.3/3">The fact is that we have a mandate for starter homes. The hon. Member for City of Durham asked what changed between March and May. With all due respect, let me tell her that we won the general election and her party lost it. We have a mandate to deliver starter homes, and the hon. Lady does not do justice to the wider issues in housing, planning and development. She fails to take into account some pertinent issues. When in power, her Government failed to deliver infrastructure planning properly. We had housing information packs and we had eco-cities. All those things failed. We had density targets. We had regional spatial strategies, which were a disaster and did not deliver homes. Under that Government, the smallest number of homes were produced since 1923, there was the largest increase in young people in temporary accommodation and housing waiting lists increased massively.</p>

	<p pid="d.147.1/1">It says something about their priorities that, in five years, the previous Government built more local authority houses than the hon. Lady&#8217;s Government did in 13 years, with a much more benign financial regime. She fails to take into account how difficult brownfield remediation is and that about a third of local planning authorities do not have a local plan in place, despite the Government&#8217;s encouragement&#8212;the local plans have not gone through the inspection process. It is not either/or. Starter homes are a radical boost to ensure that more young people in work who need homes and are languishing in band 4 and band 5 council housing and housing association lists get the opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="d.147.1/2">If a local authority has produced a decent plan&#8212;a structure plan or a deposited local plan&#8212;it will, as I said to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10575" name="Gary Streeter">the Member for South West Devon (Mr Streeter)</phrase>, be in a position to effectively put in place intermediate housing and social rent provision working with registered providers. We are not in the business of squeezing that out. It is up to local authorities to do that.</p>
	<p pid="d.147.1/3">The point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25389" name="Seema Kennedy">the Member for South Ribble (Seema Kennedy)</phrase> was right. We are not here to discuss the London housing Bill. This is about the whole of the country. In fact, this is a historic Bill because I think it is the first Bill that is subject to EVEL, so we did not have the dulcet tones of our Caledonian friends helping us on the Committee or on Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="d.147.1/4">The starter homes policy is about delivering homes to people who need them. If the hon. Member for City of Durham remembers, when the expert witnesses were challenged in Committee, they could not produce the figures, either on the day or afterwards, that showed definitively, beyond any reasonable doubt, that, from the Bristol channel to the Wash, in Chorley&#8212;Mr Deputy Speaker&#8217;s seat&#8212;in Leyland, in most parts of Lancashire, in Yorkshire and Humberside and in the east and west midlands, for most people on an average income&#8212;I accept that there is a difference with the national minimum wage and that the city of Durham is perhaps a different example&#8212;the homes would be affordable. Conservative Members on the Committee were not indulging, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> said, in some ideological pursuit. We were looking at the evidence brought before us. The evidence did not demonstrate, with all due respect, the hon. Lady&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="d.147.1/5">This is a radical Bill. I was disappointed by the lack of coherent, cogent alternatives from Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition. May I end on a slightly cheeky note? I listened with interest to the hon. Lady&#8217;s plaintive cry that she was badly treated by the programme motion. My understanding is that the usual channels came to an agreement but, because of the incompetence of Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition, they truncated or elongated various new clauses because they had forgotten to table the appropriate amendments. That is why they had to pad it out&#8212;which I am obviously not doing.</p>
	<p pid="d.147.1/6">This is an excellent, radical Bill. It will deliver. It will complement other forms of tenure. We won the election. We have a mandate. I look forward to many more starter homes in my constituency and others throughout the country to give young people in particular the start in life that they deserve in the property-owning democracy that we should be building.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.148.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10045" speakername="Clive Betts" colnum="148"  time="022:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0004.htm#160105-0004.htm_spnew56">
	<p pid="d.148.0/1">I want to raise three concerns about the Government&#8217;s proposals on starter homes. Obviously it is right, given the aspirations of many people to own their own home who currently cannot afford to, that we should look seriously at measures that enable that to happen. What we should be concerned about is whether those measures are good value for the taxpayer and have any unintended consequences. If it is such a good idea to help people on to the housing ladder, why do we not help the next group of people on to it by ensuring that the discount, or assistance, continues in perpetuity?</p>
	<p pid="d.148.0/2">I visited a Pocket development the other day. Pocket is an organisation that provides homes for people who could not afford to buy them at market prices. It insists that when the homes are resold, they are bought by people on certain income levels, so that the reduced price is passed on to the next generation of home buyers. That means that there is extra value for the taxpayer&#8217;s money, because the people who purchase the properties the second time around benefit as well. Why do the Government not consider introducing what strikes me as a very sensible, and radical, arrangement?</p>
	<p pid="d.148.0/3">Conservative Members suggest that starter homes will be additional, but in fact they will replace homes that would otherwise have been built under section 106. A quarter of a million section 106 homes have been built in the last 10 years, mainly for housing associations: affordable housing, and social housing to rent. Developers will not build starter homes in addition to the rented homes that would have been built under section 106. If Ministers disagree with that, let them come forward and say so. I believe that local authorities should be allowed to assess the housing need in their areas and reach an agreement with developers about the sort of houses that should be built under section 106, whether they be starter homes, homes for shared ownership, homes to rent or co-operatives.</p>
	<p pid="d.148.0/4">I agree with what Members have said about supply and demand. If no more homes are built than would have been built under section 106 but extra money goes into house purchasing, as is demanded by this starter home measure, the amount of money available to purchase homes will increase and the supply of homes will not. There is only one conclusion to be reached: house prices could eventually be driven up further. Members must seriously consider that conclusion. It would be helpful to know what the Government really think, but they have not produced an impact assessment.</p>

	<p pid="d.149.0/1">I have a great deal of respect for the hon. Gentleman, who talks a lot of sense a lot of the time, but he is now suggesting that only a small number of developers can affect the situation. Does he not understand the central problem, which is that most ordinary people cannot make the decision to bring forward their own projects? If that changed, developers would find that people had other genuine choices. There is a reason why 75% of people do not want to buy the products of volume house builders.</p>

	<p pid="d.149.1/1">I agree, but I do not think that that is the issue in this instance, because by and large starter homes will be produced by volume house builders.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.1/2">These homes will be built instead of other housing, and the Government are almost ignoring the right of local authorities to have an influence on the assessment of housing need. When the Minister appeared before the Select Committee, he said that it would be up to developers and local authorities to negotiate deals, including deals on starter homes, on the basis of individual sites and planning applications. How can that fit into a framework in which the Government have a target&#8212;I think it is a target rather than aspiration; no doubt the Minister will tell us whether that is the case&#8212;of 200,000 starter homes? If the Government have a target, they will have to use their powers of direction to ensure that local authorities deliver starter homes on each site that will add up to the 200,000 total. In other words, they will override the rights of local authorities to assess housing need in their areas and arrive at the best deal on each site, so that the best possible balance of housing is available. Starter homes will simply push out the other houses for rent that local people really need.</p>

	<p pid="d.149.2/1">Thank you for calling me at this late hour, Mr Deputy Speaker. I draw the House&#8217;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.2/2">I support the Bill&#8217;s emphasis on starter homes, and the corollary of that is that I oppose some of the amendments that dilute that emphasis, particularly amendments 40, 110 and 33. I believe that owner-occupiers on low incomes need all the help that they can get to get on to the housing ladder, and the starter home provisions will provide exactly that.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.2/3">I was alarmed to note that between 2007 and 2013, the most recent period for which figures are available, the number of owner-occupiers in the country fell by half a million, and the proportion fell from 68% to 63%. The provisions in this Bill are designed to arrest that decline, and it is right that they do that. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11759" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> referred in his closing remarks to the merits of a property-owning democracy, and we know that 86% of the public aspire to own their own home. There is no greater service we in this House can do tonight than help those 86% of our constituents realise their dream of owning their own home, and this Bill does that.</p>
	<p pid="d.149.2/4">On the questions raised by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr Blackman-Woods)</phrase> about affordability, I would make the following observations. First, starter homes by definition are 20% more affordable than current homes for sale, and that is a welcome step in the right direction; it is clearly an improvement on where we are today. She referred to deposits, too. The Government&#8217;s Help to Buy scheme allows people to borrow up to 95% of a property&#8217;s value. Even in London, even if the price is the maximum the deposit is only &#163;22,500, and outside London it is only a &#163;12,500 deposit. These are maximum figures; I expect many starter homes will be below these maximum figures and will be extremely affordable.</p>

	<p pid="d.150.1/1">Most first-time buyer households have two people&#8217;s incomes contributing, which improves the affordability.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.1/2">On the specific question raised by the hon. Member for City of Durham on amendment 34 about preventing buy-to-let investors, clause 2(1)(b) says starter homes will apply only to &#8220;qualifying first-time buyers&#8221;, which is very clear.</p>

	<p pid="d.150.2/1">We have had an extensive discussion both in Committee and tonight, and I look forward to rest of tonight&#8217;s debate, not least as it might allow us to see if the current shadow Front Bench is still the shadow Front Bench by the time we finish.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/2">We have had extensive discussion on the Opposition amendments on starter homes, particularly in relation to clause 1, and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr Blackman-Woods)</phrase> has returned to that today, repeating points made in some of our previous debates. Since we discussed these clauses in Committee, our spending review has doubled our investment in affordable housing. The Prime Minister announced just yesterday that &#163;1.2 billion of our starter homes funding will in the first instance support further brownfield site preparation, and that builds on the &#163;36 million made available late last year.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/3">Clause 1 sets out our position clearly&#8212;our manifesto commitment being delivered to build out 200,000 starter homes. Clause 1 includes a clear definition to be applied nationally, and I hope the House will agree that we should not water it down through the proposed amendments. We strongly believe that new housing developments need to be supported by improvements in local infrastructure&#8212;this particularly covers amendment 32. Starter homes reforms do not change this. Starter home developments will still be required to have section 106 agreements to provide necessary site-specific infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/4">Turning to amendments 33, 34, 35, 37, 38 and 39, we need to be clear that these would remove the real benefits starter homes offer to young people&#8212;the very people we are looking to help. So I maintain that our model, as defined in clause 2, should stand to define our product clearly and support national delivery.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/5">The hon. Member for City of Durham referred to amendment 39. I made it clear in Committee&#8212;Members can read what was said in Committee&#8212;that the regulations will specify that post-sale restrictions on sale and letting will exist and they are likely to be a period of five years before a starter home can be sold or let at open market value. I defend the right of any homeowner to have the same rights as any other homeowner to treat their home properly. If someone can never realise more than 80% of the value of their property, they lose the ability to move upwards in the housing market. This risks stagnation, rather than mobility. I want to incentivise young people and families to move onwards and upwards, and our model will enable families to do just that.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/6">Turning to amendments tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10575" name="Gary Streeter">the Member for South West Devon (Mr Streeter)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10268" name="John Healey">the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>, I want to be absolutely clear that the Government strongly support the need for a range of products to improve access to homeownership, and other products can perform a valuable function, too. It is for councils to consider whether these products should form part of their affordable housing ask on any given housing site. The clause will not prevent such developments from coming forward; nor will it prevent councils from securing other forms of affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/7">We are also introducing flexibilities in the Bill to encourage councils to build their own affordable housing. Let us be clear: 2014 saw the highest level of council housing starts for 23 years. However, we make no apology for prioritising support for low-cost home ownership and for making sure that we do what we can get young people on to the housing ladder, rewarding their hard work and ambition.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/8">I note the support for rent to buy, which is a product that we in the Government have supported as well. We will continue to focus on it, but at this stage I do not want to dilute our clear focus on delivering starter homes for first-time buyers. I accept that the need will vary across the country, which brings me to amendment 41. We need to be able to provide more starter homes across the country, and the outcome of our consultation will involve setting different requirements in different areas. However, I want to wait for the outcome of the consultation before I make any final decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/9">As I said in Committee, amendment 42 is unnecessary. Again, our consultation will seek views on the type of site that should be exempt from the duty, and I believe that it is right to await the outcome of that consultation. We will then publish a full range of exemptions. On Amendment 43, much of the information that the amendment proposes to have included is already reported. I want to reassure Members that we will consult on the proposed regulations relating to clause 5, and this will include details of the proposed monitoring reports.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/10">On amendments 44 and 46, we are now in a position in which we can no longer afford to hold on to employment land indefinitely if it is not in productive use. I expect local authorities to continue to examine applications relating to exemption sites with the same rigour with which they examine other applications. I am therefore not persuaded that either of the amendments is required. If land is in active use, or if there is robust evidence that it could soon be in productive use for employment uses, a council will be free to consider it as part of the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="d.150.2/11">Turning to amendment 45, I want to reassure Members that it is our firm intention that any compliance direction should be a backstop provision. We expect that provision to be used only rarely, but it will be an incentive to ensure that we do our bit to deliver these new starter homes for first-time buyers.</p>

	<p pid="d.152.1/1">Obviously, local authorities can build more council houses. I would encourage them to use the headroom that they already have to build more social housing themselves, but they will continue to have the ability to negotiate with developers in relation to section 106, just as they do now.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.1/2">On new clause 2, it is clearly important that we build new developments that can stand the test of time, just as our Victorian and other predecessors did before us. I do not believe that the new clause is necessary, however. We already have strong, clear policies on resilience, sustainability and design in the national planning policy framework, supported by building regulations. The new clause would impose additional and unnecessary burdens. I say this in the light of the fact that in more than 96% of the cases in which the Environment Agency has raised objections, those objections have been fully heeded in the final planning decisions. It is absolutely right that local authorities should take good account of the advice given by the agency on developments in flood risk areas.</p>

	<p pid="d.152.2/1">Would the Minister consider a new classification of flood plains within the development framework, to allow an additional specification for local authorities? I am prepared to reshuffle to the Tea Room to discuss this matter further if he would like to join me.</p>

	<p pid="d.152.3/1">I am always happy to discuss all things with the hon. Gentleman, but I am not going to be tempted into making changes like that here tonight. He is right, however, to suggest that councils listen to the advice given by the Environment Agency, and it is good to know that 99% of proposed new homes involved in planning outcomes have been in line with the agency&#8217;s advice.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.3/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase> opened the debate with a discussion on new clause 1. I am pleased to be the first to say that it is already a requirement that starter homes should be subject to compliance with the relevant requirements of the building regulations, as are all new buildings and all major alterations to existing ones. I note that she and other Members have been raising issues to make it clear that they want to ensure that these regulations are</p>
	<p pid="d.152.3/3">strong enough and are abided by. I believe that her proposed subsection 2(b) is not needed, because of the codes already in place. However, she and others have raised the issue of the availability of site inspection records, which is also an important issue. As a result of her representations, we have asked the Building Control Performance Standards Advisory Group to look at making inspection records available on request to building owners and prospective owners. It will report back to us with suggested amendments in February, and I of course look forward to hearing her contribute on that.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.3/4">Work is also being done by the all-party group for excellence in the built environment, which I know is looking at a range of issues in this area. I look forward to receiving its report, as we will be able to review what comes out of it in order to consider whether any strengthening of the guidance is needed going forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.152.3/5">We have had an interesting debate on this group but, for the reasons given, I hope that my right hon. Friend and others who have tabled proposals will not feel the need to press them to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="d.153.0/1">Getting rid of the current house building quality lottery is absolutely non-negotiable, but I can hear that the Minister has listened to the argument and am delighted with his announcement that he will be looking at ways in which those quality records can be made available to house buyers, so that they can see at first hand exactly how their house has been built. That is real progressm and with that, although I shall be watching carefully for the details of what he is proposing, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.164.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24745" speakername="Marcus Jones" colnum="164"  time="022:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0004.htm#160105-0004.htm_spnew68">
	<p pid="d.164.0/1">I am proud to bring forward a package of amendments to deregulate the housing association sector. In doing so, we are addressing concerns raised by the Office for National Statistics while maintaining a robust regulatory system that protects tenants and lenders alike. New clause 6 and new schedule 1 meet our commitment to help moving housing associations back into the private sector. They remove the social housing regulator&#8217;s disposals and constitutional consents regimes and clarify when we can appoint officers and managers to housing associations. Housing associations will no longer need permission from the regulator to sell or change the ownership of their stock or charge their stock for security, nor will they need permission from the regulator before they merge, change their status, restructure and wind up. These changes will free housing associations to efficiently manage their stock and how their businesses are structured.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/2">Despite the new freedoms for the sector, the regulator still has to be on top of what it is regulating. Therefore, housing associations will still need to notify the regulator of any changes made. However, the regulator will no longer be able to prevent stock transfer deals. The amendments tighten the powers of the regulator to make it clear that the appointments of officers and managers to housing associations can be made only where they significantly breach legal requirements. As now, in exercising these powers the regulator has to do so within its statutory and legal framework. Under the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, it already has a duty to act in a way that minimises interference. As a public body, the regulator also has to act rationally, and any action has to be proportionate as its decisions are open to challenge through judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/3">The amendments also give housing associations greater freedom as to how they manage their finances by abolishing the disposal proceeds fund. In future, the historical grant in a property that is sold will be required to be recycled to ensure that grant continues to be spent as it was intended. Housing associations will be able to use this money in the most efficient way possible and reinvest in building more houses and helping more of their tenants into home ownership. I believe that the amendments address the concerns highlighted by the ONS while protecting tenants and maintaining associations&#8217; ability to access private finance at low rates so that they continue to build new homes. As a result, amendment 4 removes clause 78, as it is no longer needed.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/4">New clauses 8 to 28 and new schedules 2 and 3 introduce a special administration regime for the social housing sector and the option to extend ordinary administration to housing associations. In introducing these changes, we are responding to concerns that the existing moratorium provisions are not suitable for modern, large, developing and complex housing associations. The provisions could be used in the unlikely event of a housing association becoming insolvent, thus retaining confidence in the sector&#8217;s lenders.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/5">Under the special administration regime, the Secretary of State or the regulator of social housing can apply to the court to appoint a housing administrator, who would have the objective of ensuring that the housing association&#8217;s social housing in England remained in the regulated sector. The moratorium provisions would still be available in suitable cases.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/6">The amendments cover the UK. We want the regime to cover social housing stock in England, including any such stock held by organisations registered with the social housing regulator for England but that, as legal entities, are registered in devolved Administrations. The intention is not to impact on the devolved Administrations&#8217; existing arrangements for dealing with insolvent housing associations&#8217; social housing in their jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/7">Government new clause 7 removes the Government&#8217;s ability to reclaim any outstanding financial assistance provided by the state if social housing is sold out of the regulated sector in the extremely unlikely event of an insolvency or a lender enforcing their security. That will reassure lenders that they can continue to value social housing stock on the basis that, should a housing association become insolvent or should they need to enforce their security, they will be able to self-stock out of the regulated sector if absolutely necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/8">Turning to the private rented sector, new clause 37 and the consequential amendments 12, 13 and 15 provide that where a first-tier tribunal makes a banning order against a person, that banning order may also prohibit the person from acting as a director, company secretary or similar officer of a company that carries out activities from which the person is banned. Its purpose is to close a potential loophole by providing that a person who is banned in a personal capacity from being a residential landlord or property agent cannot circumvent the ban by setting up or joining a company to continue acting in that capacity.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/9">Amendment 14 increases the minimum period a person may be banned from being a residential landlord or property agent from six months to a year. We consider that minimum length more appropriate because having a banning order made against a person reflects serious misconduct on that person&#8217;s part.</p>
	<p pid="d.164.0/10">Amendment 16 amends clause 21. Civil penalties for breaching a banning order are an alternative to prosecution. There was strong feeling across the House that we should clamp down on rogue landlords, so we have increased the civil penalty from &#163;5,000 as currently drafted up to a maximum of &#163;30,000. I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24956" name="Teresa Pearce">the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Teresa Pearce)</phrase> on the Opposition Front Bench likes the Government&#8217;s amendment.</p>

	<p pid="d.166.0/1">On Second Reading, I and a number of other Members raised the issue of clause 21 penalties. I am delighted that the Government have responded to that. Does the Minister agree that the penalties need that level of fine in order to make the bans effective?</p>

	<p pid="d.166.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his comments. He is absolutely right. It is important that we raise the level of civil penalty to &#163;30,000, because a smaller fine may not be significant enough for landlords who own numerous properties and who flout the law to think seriously about their behaviour and provide good quality, private sector rented accommodation for their tenants.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.1/2">Amendments 17 and 18 provide that a person who has had two or more relevant civil penalties imposed on them in the previous 12 months may be entered on the database of rogue landlords and property agents. Amendment 26 would amend clause 53, consequential to Government amendment 17. As the Bill is drafted, it is possible for a person to be entered on the database only if they have been convicted of a banning order offence. Consequently, any person who has had a number of civil penalties imposed on them as an alternative to prosecution in relation to such offences may not be entered on the database. We seek to remove that anomaly with these amendments. We recognise that a civil penalty is likely to be imposed rather than a prosecution in a court for less serious offences. That is why two or more civil penalties have to be imposed, as opposed to a single criminal conviction.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.1/3">Amendment 19 provides that regulations made about information to be included on the database may include the details of the civil penalties a person has incurred. Amendment 20 makes provision for an entry on the database to be removed or reduced by the local housing authority when the entry was made because the person had incurred civil penalties. That mirrors the existing provisions that deal with the removal or variation of database entries for people who have been convicted of criminal offences. Amendment 21 provides that the duration of an entry on the database may be reduced to less than two years by the local housing authority in certain circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.1/4">Amendment 22 provides that the Secretary of State may provide information held on the database in an anonymised form to any person with an interest in private sector housing for statistical and research purposes.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.1/5">In Committee, the Bill was amended to make it a criminal offence to breach a banning order imposed under chapter 2 of part 2. Changes were also made to ensure that chapter 4 applies to the offence of breach of a banning order in the same way as it applies to other offences. Amendments 23, 24 and 25 are minor and consequential on the introduction of the banning order offence.</p>

	<p pid="d.166.2/1">I will speak to new clauses 55 and 56 and amendments 49, 47 and 48.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.2/2">New clause 55 would require local authorities to put in place a scheme to license and provide for the accreditation of private sector landlords in their area. Private rented housing is an important part of the housing sector. Nine million people rent privately and the sector is growing. In the past, the private rented sector was often a place for young people to find short-term solutions to their housing needs, perhaps while studying or establishing their careers. Now, almost half of those who rent are over 35 and they need security and stability. Many people are stuck in the private sector, unable to secure any of the declining amount of affordable social housing or to save for a deposit to buy their own home owing to the ever-rising rents.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.2/3">Most landlords are effective and efficient in letting their property. They provide good properties and support their tenants. Many landlords are already accredited through independent or local authority schemes and some are licensed as they provide houses in multiple occupation. However, there are a few rogue landlords, as we call them, who bring down the name of the private rented sector and the reputation of all landlords. Such rogue landlords often provide substandard accommodation at extortionate prices, sometimes intimidate tenants and often cannot be reached until the rent is due.</p>
	<p pid="d.166.2/4">The accreditation of landlords has been a feature of the private rented sector for more than 15 years. A local authority-led accreditation and licensing scheme would allow all private landlords to meet set standards. As it would be administered locally, it would give councils the power to establish the scheme that best suited their local housing need. Some local authorities might have particular difficulties with private landlords in respect of housing standards and want to address those through the scheme. Others might have no real problem, but might want to better understand the housing need in the local area and to monitor standards. An accreditation and licensing scheme would also support other measures in the Bill, such as the database of rogue landlords and banning orders. A local authority-led accreditation and licensing scheme would undoubtedly drive up standards across the private rented sector&#8212;something we all want&#8212;and bring the select few rogue landlords up to the standards of the many good landlords across the country.</p>

	<p pid="d.168.7/1">I do accept those facts, and in Committee there was much in this section of the Bill that we agreed on. Amendments were tabled that the Minister took away and has now agreed to, which I welcome. New clause 55 is just to ask whether accreditation and licensing by local authorities would create a more professional private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="d.168.7/2">New clause 56 would give the Secretary of State the power to introduce a pilot scheme that would see the housing ombudsman extend its cover in London to the private sector. It would require a report from the Secretary of State following the pilot scheme and give the Secretary of State the power to extend the powers of the housing ombudsman to the private sector nationwide after that pilot.</p>
	<p pid="d.168.7/3">Private rented housing is a fundamental part of the housing sector and the number of people in the sector has risen. There are now 1.5 million families with children in such properties. They can be evicted with as little as two months&#8217; notice. Overall, 9 million people are now renting. In London, the private rented sector makes up a large proportion of the housing market. We proposed introducing a pilot scheme in London to establish whether extending the housing ombudsman scheme to the private rented sector would be advisable. Most landlords offer a good property with good support for their tenants, but disputes can occur. These disputes occur across all forms of housing, but currently the private sector is not covered by the housing ombudsman. It could be a concern that part of a property is dangerous, or that part of the tenancy agreement or the lease is not being upheld. There could be a delay in responding to a situation in the flat, perhaps a problem with electrics, gas or heating. The housing ombudsman is a fantastic independent service which helps to resolve many of these complaints and concerns.</p>
	<p pid="d.168.7/4">The housing ombudsman considers complaints about how a landlord has responded to reports of the problem, rather than the actual problem itself, and considers what is fair in the circumstances. Some 87% of cases referred to the housing ombudsman were resolved by landlords and tenants with its support and by using the landlords complaints procedure. Many of these have gone on to build and keep good relations, and continue to rent from and let to each other.</p>
	<p pid="d.168.7/5">It is important that we look at extending the housing ombudsman. The Bill may see a decline in social housing, both local authority managed and housing association managed. While all local authorities and housing associations must be a member of the ombudsman scheme, at present private sector landlords can join the scheme only on a voluntary basis. Not nearly enough of them do, however, leaving many tenants in a position where, when things go wrong, they have nowhere left to turn. Indeed, the type of landlord whom tenants are likely to want to contact the housing ombudsman about are the least likely to sign up voluntarily to the scheme. The private rented sector will increase its share of the housing market as a result of the measures in the Bill. Surely it is right to ensure that tenants are afforded the same protections and dispute resolution service across all sectors.</p>

	<p pid="d.170.0/1">I agree that that is a possibility, which is why we are proposing that new clause 56 would see the extension of the housing ombudsman scheme, at first through a pilot scheme in London and then potentially across the country. I believe this would help many tenants in resolving disputes.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/2">On amendment 49, part 3 of the Bill makes provision for private landlords to recover abandoned premises from tenants without going to court. We appreciate the need for landlords to recover abandoned premises, but the measures give landlords dangerous powers to evict tenants with speed and ease. We believe the Bill does not provide safeguards for genuine cases where somebody could be away from the property legitimately, such as a stay in hospital or somebody working away from home. We believe the measures will lead to further pressure on our already stretched local authorities. As the measures stand, we believe they go against the spirit of other parts of the Bill where we have looked to crack down on rogue and criminal landlords through banning orders and a database, and to drive up standards. Instead, as they stand, the measures give the very same landlords a way to evict without recourse to the courts, and with speed and ease.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/3">Many organisations contacted us to raise concerns about the proposed legislation. I raised their concerns in Committee, but it is worth raising them again. Crisis and Shelter have both spoken out against these clauses and recommended that they be removed from the Bill. They were particularly concerned that: vulnerable tenants could be unintentionally evicted; tenants will be unable to challenge their eviction effectively; and that there is insufficient evidence that abandonment is a widespread problem and that there is existing legal provision to deal with genuine cases of abandonment. In addition, they believe that by undermining the role of courts in the eviction process, the changes will put more tenants at risk of homelessness. Further representations were made in written and oral evidence to the Committee noting concern with the proposals. Crisis highlighted that the</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/4">&#8220;Bill creates a new &#8216;fast track&#8217; eviction process for landlords to reclaim possession of a property which has been abandoned&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/5">and that there was no</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/6">&#8220;robust evidence to suggest that abandonment is a significant or widespread problem.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/7">Citing the Bill and the Government&#8217;s impact assessment, it also stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/8">&#8220;Landlord associations have estimated that 1% of calls made to their helplines relate to abandonment. There are approximately 1.4 million landlords. From this figure the government has extrapolated that there are only 1,750 tenancies abandoned every year, which amounts to only 0.04% of private renting households.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/9">We heard concern from legal organisations, such as the Housing Law Practitioners Association, which was unaware of any evidential basis suggesting the need for such a power as that in part 3 of the Bill and did not understand what was thought to be defective in the existing law. It also noted that the &#8220;trigger&#8221; rent arrears in clause 50 were plainly modelled on those in ground 8 in schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988. If those arrears are made out, the landlord is already entitled to a mandatory possession order under ground 8. If a landlord has a mandatory right to possession already, why does he need a right to bypass the courts?</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/10">The association was also uneasy about the re-instatement provisions and had many concerns about the proposals. Others noted that they did not think the proposals were necessary at all. In fact, there is already legal provision for cases of abandonment in the form of the legal rule of implied surrender, which is where a tenant behaves in such a way that would make a landlord believe they wanted to end a tenancy, such as emptying the property of all its possessions or handing back the keys. Crucially, there has to be evidence of actual abandonment&#8212;evidence that the tenant has gone for good&#8212;and this could be evidence from neighbours or visual evidence, such as possessions being cleared. The landlord can accept this and then legally change the locks without any court proceedings being required. The question has been raised with us why the measures are being introduced, given the existing provisions protecting landlords in such circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/11">Many of the organisations that approached us wanted the provisions to be withdrawn from the Bill altogether, but our amendment proposes an extra layer, requiring the local housing authority to confirm that it suspects that the property is abandoned before a landlord can recover the abandoned premises. Landlords could use the proposals in the Bill to secure eviction just by writing tenants a couple of letters, as an act of revenge or to kick out a legitimate tenant who is away on business or in hospital; and what would happen if a landlord says he has sent a letter but the tenant never receives it, after which the tenant goes away a couple of weeks later on holiday and the landlord evicts them while they are away?</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/12">The Bill requires the landlord only to say that the property is abandoned, rather than for it actually to be abandoned, and that could be open to abuse. That is why we would like to insert a reasonable extra layer in the proposals. Under the amendment, the local housing authority would need to confirm that it also suspects that the property is abandoned, ensuring that a landlord could not just say so. The amendment would add the voice of a local, respectable and accountable body, such as the council, to a landlord&#8217;s concerns and to the process and ensure that the measures are not open to abuse. Given that there are estimated to be only 1,750 occasions a year when such a situation would arise and that there are about 400 local authorities, it is unlikely to overburden local authorities. The clauses clearly need to be amended if they are to work, are not open to abuse and can be used appropriately on the rare occasions that a landlord requires a property back.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/13">Amendments 47 and 48, also on abandoned premises, would extend the time period between the two letters needed to evict a tenant. Amendment 47 would specify that the date by which the tenant must reply must be after the 12-week period, while amendment 48 would provide longer between the first and second warnings. I spoke, on the previous amendment, about the flaws in the abandonment proposals and how they were open to abuse or error, meaning that landlords could use the proposals to evict tenants just by writing them a couple of letters.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/14">I completely understand the situation a landlord is in when a tenant truly has abandoned a property. In Committee, I raised the need for local authorities to know not just who rogue landlords were but who rogue tenants were. Tenants also enter into a legal contract with a landlord when they take on a property, and they should not breach that agreement, just as landlords are not expected to breach their end of the agreement, yet these clauses give rogue landlords the ability to evict with speed and ease.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/15">The Minister has already responded to the issues raised in Committee and added provision for a third wave of letters, for which I am grateful. It is still important, however, to safeguard these measures against abuse. We believe that by extending the minimum amount of time before a landlord is able to recover abandoned premises, those with legitimate reasons for absence from their property would be able to respond, which would help to safeguard against potential abuse.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/16">One of the concerns raised about these proposals was the pressure on local housing authorities that might have a duty to rehouse tenants who have been evicted, even if just in emergency accommodation following the eviction. When faced with someone about to be evicted under section 21 notices, local housing authorities have the advantage of time in the current system to plan the resources; if they know that a resident is going to be evicted, they can try to do something about it before the date of eviction. Under the proposals in the Bill, however, residents could be evicted in haste, placing further pressure on local housing authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/17">The amendments would insert a little more time into the recovery of abandoned premises, which would ease the pressure on local housing authorities and help to avoid any abuse of the process. In addition, it would be advantageous to extend the time period between the first two letters needed to evict a tenant suspected of abandoning premises from four weeks to eight weeks, because that would safeguard against error and a landlord using the measure to kick out a legitimate tenant who is away on business, in hospital or even on holiday. By extending the time period between the letters, there is obviously less chance of that happening. That will safeguard against abuse and allow tenants more time to query the landlord or to seek housing advice. As there is no court involvement in this process, it gives the tenant more time to assess their options.</p>
	<p pid="d.170.0/18">It is clear that the Bill&#8217;s proposals could affect all tenants in the private rented sector, and that all landlords will have the powers, even though they are open to abuse and abandonment accounts only for an estimated 1,750 occasions a year. Why not get this right so that it safeguards against abuse and does what it is supposed to do? That would allow landlords to recover abandoned premises and not allow rogue landlords to evict tenants with ease. Legislation on abandonment needs to be watertight, because although it affects only 0.04% of tenancies, it could be abused.</p>

	<p pid="d.172.0/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to new clause 5, which is complementary to clause 26&#8212;previously clause 22&#8212;of this excellent Bill and which relates to rogue landlords and letting agents. The new clause simply requires local authorities to add a question to their council tax registration forms seeking information about the tenure of a property. It would not only be administratively easy to implement, but the cost would be de minimis. The purpose of the new clause is to provide a database for all local authorities, identifying the owners of privately rented properties.</p>
	<p pid="d.172.0/2">Currently, local authorities know who is paying council tax on a private property, but they have no way of knowing if it is owner-occupied or tenanted. Having easy access to such information would have numerous benefits for local planning authorities, environmental health departments, social services, tenants, HMRC and good landlords. The Residential Landlords Association fully supports this measure.</p>

	<p pid="d.173.0/1">I strongly support new clause 5 and I hope that the Government will look favourably on it. Does my hon. Friend agree that one critical benefit of the new clause is the ability to use the information to track rogue landlords when they move from one place to another?</p>

	<p pid="d.173.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. That is why it is so important that all local authorities adopt this measure; rogue landlords will have properties in more than one area.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/2">The database would also assist local planners in measuring the size of the private rented sector in their area. That would help to develop future planning policy. Enforcement of existing regulations relating to the private rented sector would be made easier, as the landlord could be identified and contacted. Indeed, the absence of this information could alert local authorities to possible irregularities such as illegal subletting, unregulated houses in multiple occupation&#8212;this is becoming a problem in my Hornchurch and Upminster constituency&#8212;housing benefit fraud and public health issues. Finite resources could then be targeted at the most troublesome tenanted properties via the Land Registry.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/3">HMRC would be able to identify non-declaration of rental income for taxation purposes, but importantly this measure would help tenants by identifying rogue landlords who do not maintain their properties in safe, habitable condition or treat their tenants fairly. An estimated one third of privately rented properties do not meet decent homes criteria and one in six present a severe threat to health or safety because of unsafe gas and electrical appliances, leaking plumbing or roofs, faulty fire alarms, vermin and damp. Too many tenants live at the whim of rogue landlords, unaware of their rights, in squalid conditions with insecure tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/4">Local authorities do not have the resources or capacity effectively to inspect and enforce all these issues. In clause 26, the Bill gives local housing authorities in England responsibility for maintaining the content of the database and ensures that</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/5">&#8220;local housing authorities are able to edit the database&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/6">and to keep it updated. It is difficult to see how local authorities are going to be able to fulfil this function if they do not have the database to refer to and if they do not know which properties in their area are tenanted and who or where the landlords are.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/7">The licensing of landlords has been shown to be complex and costly, with patchy results, as only the good landlords will register and the costs of registering passed on to the tenant. It has been argued that councils already have the power to collect tenure information on their council tax registration forms but, crucially, only a small handful do so. To be effective, all councils need to use this power consistently as rogue landlords often operate in more than one area. That is why the new clause makes the use of the power mandatory. It is not further regulation, but a measure to facilitate the enforcement of existing regulations affecting the private rented sector and the taxation of landlords. It is not administratively burdensome or a drain on scarce resources, but it would benefit tenants, good landlords, local authorities and HMRC. I look forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s comments on the proposal when he responds to the debate.</p>

Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey)</phrase> in his place. He was a member of the Committee at that time. It is right to give local authorities a lighter-touch way of dealing with the less serious problems that may exist in private sector properties by introducing civil penalties and rent recovery. The idea that landlords should be getting public money when clearly providing a property that breaches legal requirements is outrageous. It is good that the Government are acting and legislating, I think with all-party support, to ensure that the money paid out in those wrongful circumstances can be properly recovered by the public sector and indeed by tenants where their money has been used to pay for rent for a property that has not met the legal standards.</p>
	<p pid="d.174.0/2">I want to raise one or two issues mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24956" name="Teresa Pearce">the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Teresa Pearce)</phrase> and refer to the Select Committee report. When the Committee published its report&#8212;I am sorry to cut slightly across my hon. Friend on this issue&#8212;we concluded that licensing schemes should be a matter for local discretion. We said that they were a useful tool in the armoury of local authorities to deal with particularly bad problems in areas with poor landlords and poor-quality housing, but we adopted a localist approach and said that in the end it should be a matter for local discretion. However, we did raise the problem&#8212;it is right that my hon. Friend raised the issue again&#8212;that many authorities chose not to take up licensing schemes, not because they thought they were a bad idea, but because the whole bureaucracy around the schemes deters authorities and makes it expensive to get them in place. I hope the Minister will have another look at that.</p>
	<p pid="d.174.0/3">I speak from experience, not in my constituency but in the next-door constituency of Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough. A licensing scheme that was introduced in Page Hall has been very successful in dealing with the real problems caused by bad landlords and bad properties, but the process of establishing it involved a great deal of bureaucracy and money that could have been better spent on enforcement and attempts to deal with the inadequate housing situation.</p>

	<p pid="d.174.1/1">The hon. Gentleman led the production of the Select Committee report very effectively during the last Parliament. As he will recall, the evidence suggested that good landlords were happy to go on to the register, or, alternatively, were reluctant, but did so because they wanted to play by the rules. The rogue landlords, by definition, do not want to play by the rules and would not register in the first place. The process tends to be not terribly productive.</p>

	<p pid="d.175.0/1">I think that when authorities have been able to target resources at a particular area, go for the bad landlords and try to get them to sign up, the system has been relatively successful. I have had experience of one case, but there is a bigger case in Newham, where the local authority has been licensing all the private sector properties in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.0/2">If the necessary resources are put in, a licensing scheme can be effective. The difficulty is that local authorities can only charge for the administration costs. They cannot charge for the costs involved in following up inadequate properties, and trying to enforce proper conditions in those properties. The problem that currently affects private sector housing relates not to the powers that local authorities may or may not have, but to the fact that, in many instances, they do not have the resources that would enable them to use their powers effectively. That is a real challenge that needs to be addressed, and on which we ought to reflect further. I do not know whether the Government have any more ideas, but rent recovery and civil penalties may help a little.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.0/3">Let me return to another issue that was raised by the Select Committee, and to which the Minister referred. Why cannot local authorities keep the fines that are imposed on bad landlords for failing in their duties? It seems a little odd that in the less serious cases authorities can keep the proceeds of civil penalties, but in the most serious cases, which often cost the most in terms of local authority officers&#8217; time&#8212;and, in my experience, authorities often do not recover the costs when they go to court&#8212;the fines go back to the central Exchequer. What is the Government&#8217;s problem with allowing authorities that are involved in the most serious cases, with the greatest costs, to keep the fines that are levied?</p>

	<p pid="d.175.1/1">In some instances, particularly in London boroughs, it is so lucrative to be a landlord that the civil penalties are not enough of a disincentive. People can be in court at one moment and building another shoddy flat at the next. They will simply pay the fine, because ultimately it will represent only a tiny proportion of their profit.</p>

	<p pid="d.175.2/1">That is true. I am pleased that the Government seem to want to increase the fine levels. I hope that eventually the banning orders will kick in, and a number of civil penalties will be imposed over a period. That is the intention of one of the amendments, and it, too, is welcome. I think that banning orders will have an impact if they are properly effective, along with other measures in the Bill that will help to deal with rogue landlords.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.2/2">Before I say a few words about the ombudsman, I want to say something about new clause 5, which we heard about from <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11308" name="Angela Watkinson">the hon. Member for Hornchurch and Upminster (Dame Angela Watkinson)</phrase>. I think that it is an excellent measure, and the Government ought to think seriously about it. It is very simple, and would be very light on public sector resources. Indeed, it would probably save public money, because it would not be necessary to chase around finding out who owned properties when there was a problem with them. The information would be readily available, at little cost to the public purse. Local authorities would be able to do their jobs more effectively, as they would spend less time trying to find out who was the owner or the letting agent. Tenants often do not have that information, but by the time a problem occurs, authorities want to have it to hand so that they can take immediate action against those who are responsible.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.2/3">The hon. Lady also put her finger on a very important point. In the case of the licensing scheme in Sheffield, I suddenly realised why landlords were so opposed to it. There was, of course, the possibility that local authorities would carry out more inspections of their properties, find faults and take action, but what most disturbed them, in my view, was that HMRC would know that a property was tenanted and rent was being paid to someone, and one or two further inquiries might follow. I think that is absolutely right: that should be done&#8212;the taxpayer ought to be paid their tax on rent that is collected. Very often in these properties there are not proper tenancy agreements, the rent is simply paid cash in hand and the taxpayer receives none of it. Having that information in the public domain that can be used for any proper purpose&#8212;I hope that would include being able to pass it on to the tax authorities&#8212;has another benefit to the public purse. That is a very sensible and simple measure, and I hope the Government will be prepared to support it.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.2/4">Finally, I hope the Government will give further thought to the housing ombudsman covering the private rented sector. I know there may be the view that this is a private sector and therefore a public sector ombudsman should not be looking at these matters, but let us draw a comparison. The coalition Government extended the remit of the local authority ombudsman to cover social care homes even when the person in those homes was paying for themselves, so there was no direct public sector involvement. That remit was extended to social care homes because it was thought that it was somehow wrong that some people could not take an element of social care provision to the ombudsman for a decision while other people in the same care home could.</p>
	<p pid="d.175.2/5">For example, if a local authority discharges its homelessness duty by allocating or placing someone in a private sector property and it all goes wrong, the local authority element of that, where it makes the placement, would presumably be under the jurisdiction of the local authority ombudsman. However, if it is the private landlord who does not deal with that tenancy properly, there would be no remit for the tenant to go to any ombudsman at all. Once the local authority discharges its duty and makes provision to have someone housed in the private sector, at some point in the transfer from someone being homeless to them receiving a private tenancy, there would be a switch from an individual having recourse to go to an ombudsman and their not having recourse to do so. There could be great dispute about whether the action of allocating someone a house in the private sector as part of a local authority&#8217;s homelessness responsibility was covered by an ombudsman or not. I therefore hope that the Government will reflect on the fact that this may be one of the gaps in the provision of the ombudsman&#8217;s service. I know that they are looking overall at reconfiguration of the service, and they might give some thought to this extension as a sensible way of covering one of the gaps.</p>

	<p pid="d.176.0/1">I wish to make some comments about the Government new clauses on deregulation of housing associations and ask the Minister some questions.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/2">In Committee we raised several probing amendments relating to clause 78, which covered reducing regulation but did not specify what measures the Government would be taking to deregulate the social housing sector. Of course, we understand that the Government are now seeking, under amendment 4, to leave out clause 78 and replace it with new clause 6 and new schedule 1. As the Minister said in Committee in response to probing amendments:</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/3">&#8220;I intend to introduce a package of measures on Report. The ONS announced the reclassification decision on <phrase class="date" code="2016-10-30">30 October</phrase>, which has not yet given us the time to carefully work through a package in time for the Committee.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Housing and Planning Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2015-12-01">1 December 2015</phrase>; c. 465.]</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/4">This is our first opportunity to see these new measures.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/5">We welcome replacing the general with the specific. Removing clause 78 and replacing it with new clause 6 and new schedule 1 is primary legislation. Clause 78 gave Ministers a sweeping open power to repeal regulations affecting housing associations. At least new clause 6 and new schedule 1 have merit in being precise&#8212;but they are very long. In total, the new clauses and schedules in this group amount to 34 pages of new legislation&#8212;almost a quarter as long as the Bill itself. They were tabled close to the deadline for debate on Report, and over the Christmas recess, so there is no way that this House, or the organisations and experts that have a direct interest in these provisions, can properly scrutinise or challenge the Government on the content of this newly introduced legislation. We can see that the new clauses and new schedule contain several elements that address some of the issues raised by the ONS as part of the reclassification of housing associations. They will address the issues through the removal of the Government&#8217;s consent power over how housing associations hold their assets.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/6">As we observed in Committee, housing associations have said that artificial restrictions on valuations mean that association homes that have been transferred from local authorities can be valued at only 30% to 45% of what they are worth. They have asked for that restriction to be removed, because those homes, like other affordable homes owned by such associations, should be valued at about 60% of their market worth. The Government&#8217;s powers over the management of housing associations, and in particular the power of the regulator&#8212;the Homes and Communities Agency&#8212;to appoint managers and officers to housing associations, were also identified as key areas of concern by the ONS. Again, we can see that this question is being addressed through the new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/7">New schedules 2 and 3, along with several of the new clauses, will introduce a special administration regime in the event of the potential insolvency of a housing association. That, too, was a matter that was raised by the housing associations. Government control over the voluntary winding up, dissolution and restructuring of housing associations was also cited by the ONS in its judgment. That question is now dealt with by new clauses 13 and 14, among others.</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/8">I want to ask the Minister three questions on these subjects. The House will know that the housing associations were shocked when the ONS decided to reclassify them as public bodies. That caught them unawares and it was seen as an unwelcome step. They are keen to see the reclassification reversed, and Ministers claim that changes in the Bill will do that, but on what basis can they give us that assurance? On what basis should we accept it? Is it simply the Minister&#8217;s assertion, or has he had detailed discussions with the ONS on whether the new clauses would lead to the reclassification of housing associations as private sector bodies?</p>
	<p pid="d.176.0/9">Secondly, do the Government have any plans to conduct an independent impact assessment for the measures in new clauses 6 to 28 and for the new range of amendments on the deregulation of housing associations, relating to their ability to deliver more housing? Thirdly, what do the Government intend to do if reclassification back into the private sector does not take place?</p>

	<p pid="d.178.0/1">I shall try to keep my comments brief while I address as many of those points as I can. I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11308" name="Angela Watkinson">the Member for Hornchurch and Upminster (Dame Angela Watkinson)</phrase> for tabling her new clause to require a local authority to request tenure information from residents, owners and managing agents whenever the authority requests council tax information. Like my hon. Friend, I am supportive of ensuring that local authorities have the tools necessary to tackle rogue landlords in the private rented sector in their areas. The Government are committed to promoting a strong, professional private rented sector in which good landlords can prosper and hard-working tenants can enjoy decent standards and receive a service that represents value for money for their rent.</p>
	<p pid="d.178.0/2">I am sympathetic to my hon. Friend&#8217;s proposal, but we need to be mindful that we are increasing the tools that local authorities can use by requiring tenancy deposit protection schemes to provide tenancy deposit information, when requested, to local housing authorities and other relevant bodies in England, as set out in part 5 of the Bill. As my hon. Friend knows, local authorities already have powers in existing and draft legislation to seek information on housing tenure, through the Local Government Finance Act 1992 and the Housing Act 2004, as well as through Land Registry and housing benefit data. It will be important to establish why local authorities are not already using the powers they have at their disposal. I am therefore pleased to tell my hon. Friend that I propose to set up a working group to examine this important issue. The group will include experts from the sector, such as landlords, local authorities and the Local Government Association, and will report back to Ministers within three to six months. Given my hon. Friend&#8217;s strong interest in this area, I would like to invite her to be part of that working group.</p>

	<p pid="d.178.1/1">It is good that the Minister has an interest in pursuing the ideas that the hon. Lady has raised, but if the group reports back in three to six months, that means that this legislation will be passed without these changes being introduced. If the working group came up with the view that these proposals were needed, what is the earliest reasonable date by which they could be implemented?</p>

	<p pid="d.178.2/1">I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee for that question. We first need to establish whether or not primary legislation is required, and we also need to establish exactly why local authorities are not using the powers they currently have at their disposal. That is what we intend to do, and it is why we have set up the working group. From that work, we will consider what measures are necessary&#8212;or not&#8212;to take forward the proposal made by my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="d.179.0/1">I understand that there might be a need to establish why local authorities are not using powers they already have. Is the Minister saying to the House that local authorities currently have all the powers that are contained in the new clause proposed by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11308" name="Angela Watkinson">the hon. Member for Hornchurch and Upminster (Dame Angela Watkinson)</phrase>?</p>

	<p pid="d.179.1/1">The significant difference in my hon. Friend&#8217;s new clause is that there is a compulsion on local authorities to obtain the information that it requires and then to act on that. At the moment, there is nothing to prevent local authorities from doing that, as they have the powers from the 1992 Act and they have the powers to use that information from the 2004 Act.</p>
	<p pid="d.179.1/2">I shall move on to deal with new clause 55, which would require all local authorities to operate an accreditation and licensing scheme for private landlords. I do not believe that local authorities should be required to operate an accreditation scheme in their area. Accreditation is only of interest to good landlords who rent out decent accommodation, so it does not help to identify and tackle the criminal landlords, who we are tackling through other measures in the Bill. In addition, local authorities are in the best position to decide whether or not there is a need for an accreditation scheme in their area. I welcome the Chairman of the Select Committee&#8217;s comments about this new clause, particularly what he said about the civil penalties that the Bill includes and rent repayment orders. Both of those were measures that the Select Committee sought in the last Parliament. He mentioned bureaucracy, but he does need to consider that due process does need to be followed and full public consultation needs to take place. That is a challenge in regard to the concern that he had, but he did make an important point about best practice. Some local authorities are doing this very well and we need to spread that best practice and examine how we can do so.</p>
	<p pid="d.179.1/3">New clause 56 seeks to widen the housing ombudsman&#8217;s role to cover private sector housing and disputes between tenants and private landlords in London through requiring the Secretary of State to set up a pilot scheme, and then potentially extend it nationwide. As I set out in Committee, private sector landlords can of course already join the housing ombudsman scheme on a voluntary basis. Indeed, many landlords who wish to assure their tenants of the quality of their services do so already. The Greater London Authority would need to take a view on whether it would be appropriate for the housing ombudsman to expand its role in London given linkages with the London rental standard. Were these landlords required to sign up, we would not expect the same level of engagement or compliance with the process, and determinations would not be enforceable. We would risk increasing costs while the tenants of reluctant landlords may not see the benefit.</p>

	<p pid="d.179.2/1">Given that there are three quarters of a million properties in the private rented sector that have a category one hazard, does the Minister share my disappointment that only 250 landlords a year have been prosecuted over the past eight years? Why does he not think it sensible to make a simple change in the law to allow tenants themselves to take civil action against rogue landlords?</p>

	<p pid="d.180.0/1">I hear what the hon. Lady says, but with this Bill we are significantly changing the dynamic so that local authorities can keep the civil penalties&#8212;penalties of up to &#163;30,000 on a landlord&#8212;and recover money paid in housing benefit through rent repayment orders. As for why a tenant cannot go ahead and invoke a banning order as a local authority can, we need to bear in mind that first-tier tribunals will be able to issue banning orders following an application from a local housing authority. Banning orders are being introduced to help deal with landlords who repeatedly fail to comply with their legal responsibilities. The important point is that local housing authorities will have the information about previous offences that have been committed by the landlord anywhere in England and will therefore be in the best position to determine whether a banning order will be the most appropriate sanction. Where a tenant or an organisation has information about a landlord&#8217;s transgression, they will be able to report it to the particular housing authority, which will now be more able to move forward with such action because they will have additional resource.</p>

	<p pid="d.180.2/1">As the hon. Lady will know from looking at the original Bill, the penalty&#8212;I use the word penalty rather than fine&#8212;is &#163;5,000. That has now been increased with these amendments, which I hope she will support, to &#163;30,000. In regard to amendments 47, 48 and 49, the process for serving warning notices in the operation of the unpaid rent condition means in practice that it will take a landlord at least 12 weeks to recover an abandoned property.</p>
	<p pid="d.180.2/2">Amendments 48 and 49 would add at least a further four weeks, and amendment 47 would delay the process further if a landlord needed to seek the local authority&#8217;s view on whether the property had been abandoned. I can see that some kind of independent verification as a safeguard might, on first appearance, seem an attractive proposition. However, in addition to the obvious delay to the process that that would cause, I do not see how the local authority could deliver that verification with any more precision than the landlord. It would also create a significant new burden on local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.180.2/3">The provisions can also be used where a property has been abandoned by the tenant and rent arrears continue to accrue. In those circumstances, it is important that landlords should be able to recover the premises with minimum delay, but while giving the tenant every opportunity to confirm that they have not abandoned it. We therefore believe that three months, or 12 weeks, is the right period. We brought forward a number of further safeguards in Committee including a third warning notice, which must be affixed to the property.</p>
	<p pid="d.180.2/4">I am conscious of the time, and I hope that colleagues who have tabled amendments as part of this group will not divide the House unnecessarily. The Government amendments will also confirm our support for an</p>

	<p pid="d.187.1/3">(b) that it becomes unnecessary, by one or more of the following means, for the housing administration order to remain in force for that purpose.</p>

	<p pid="d.216.0/1">New clause 29 allows the Secretary of State to make regulations via the affirmative procedure about the fees to be paid by applicants when they make planning applications. New clause 30 and new schedule 4 set out a dispute resolution process to speed up section 106 negotiations in order to help housing starts to proceed more quickly. They provide for a person to be appointed to help resolve outstanding issues in relation to section 106 planning obligations. The new process will also apply only in situations where the local planning authority would be likely to grant planning permission if satisfactory planning obligations were entered into, ensuring that we only target sites where prolonged negotiations could stall development.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/2">After the appointed person issues their report on that mechanism, the parties will still be free to agree their own terms if they do not agree with the report, but only if they do so quickly. We want to encourage the parties to tie up their loose ends quickly. We are consulting on the finer detail of the process and we will bring forward regulations in due course.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/3">New clause 31 seeks to provide the Secretary of State with a power to restrict the enforcement of planning obligations in relation to affordable housing in certain situations. We have included a definition of affordable housing that includes starter homes. These changes will support house building. We will be consulting on how to use that power, and measures will be introduced through regulations.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/4">New clauses 32 to 36 and new schedule 5 are designed to ensure that public sector bodies make efficient use of their land and buildings as part of their duty to deliver the best value for the taxpayer. I want to thank my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General for his excellent work on those amendments.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/5">New clause 32 requires Ministers of the Crown, and any public bodies added through regulations, to engage with other relevant public bodies when developing proposals to dispose of land. That duty was inspired by local authorities who have experienced varying levels of engagement, ranging from excellent to none at all. It will set out clearly what local authorities and other relevant bodies should expect when the Government are disposing of land.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/6">Clause 32 will ensure that engagement takes place on an ongoing basis from the point at which proposals for disposal are being developed. The clause requires Ministers of the Crown to engage with local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.216.0/7">New clause 33 is a transparency measure and will require public authorities to prepare and publish a report setting out: details of land that is surplus to requirements and has been retained as surplus for longer than two years or, in the case of property that is wholly or mainly residential, longer than six months; and why surplus assets have not been released. Regulations will make further provision about reports, and guidance will give more detail on determining whether land is surplus.</p>

	<p pid="d.217.0/1">New clauses 32 and 33 contain references to Scotland. Will the Minister bring forward further detail on what the implications will be for Scotland and what communications he will be having with the Scottish Government on the reports that are to be produced?</p>

	<p pid="d.217.1/1">As I have just outlined, we will be making further provisions about the reports through regulation, and there will be guidance giving more detail. I will be happy to speak with the hon. Lady and her colleagues in the weeks ahead.</p>
	<p pid="d.217.1/2">New clause 34 enables the Secretary of State to use the power to direct the disposal of land in specified circumstances. These will be set out in regulations. One such circumstance could be where land is listed in a body&#8217;s surplus land report under clause 33&#8212;for example, land that has been held surplus for longer than two years or, in the case of wholly or mainly residential land, longer than six months. The Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 provides important safeguards, and I want to be clear today that they will continue to apply to the new provisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.217.1/3">New clauses 35 and 36 represent a significant step forward in the transparency of performance on the sustainability and efficiency of the public sector estate. They extend requirements contained in section 86 of the Climate Change Act 2008 to provide an annual report on progress made towards making the estate more efficient and sustainable. New clause 35 provides for similar reporting requirements to apply to local government in respect of each local authority&#8217;s estate. Schedule 5 sets out local authorities in England that are subject to this new duty. Applying reporting requirements to the local government estate will strengthen accountability to local taxpayers and support local government&#8217;s drive to be more efficient and have effective use of their assets, as the best local authorities are already doing.</p>
	<p pid="d.217.1/4">New clause 36 mirrors the 2008 Act requirements in respect of the Ministry of Defence military estate. The inclusion of the military estate in the annual state of the estate report will bring greater transparency to that part of the Government estate and its performance in key areas. Government amendment 8 specifies that new clauses 32 and 33 extend to England, Wales and Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="d.217.1/5">In Committee, I was invited by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11927" name="Stephen Hammond">the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> to consider the potential for fast-track planning applications and having a more competitive planning process. Other hon. Friends backed that up and made similar comments. I can now say that the Government are bringing forward new clauses 43 to 46 and new clause 75 to test the benefits of introducing competition in the processing of planning applications. New clause 43 would give the Secretary of State the power, by regulation, to introduce pilot schemes for competition in the processing of applications for planning permission. It will also give him the power to designate who participates in a pilot scheme. Let me be clear: this is about competition for the processing of applications, not their determination. The democratic determination of planning applications by local planning authorities is a fundamental pillar of the planning system, and that will remain the case during any pilot schemes that the Secretary of State brings forward. Let me also be clear that new clause 43 would require that any pilot schemes brought forward by the Secretary of State will be for a limited period specified in regulations.</p>
	<p pid="d.217.1/6">New clause 44 provides that regulations may set out how any pilot schemes should operate. New clause 45 provides that regulations may include provision for the setting, publishing and charging of fees by designated persons and planning authorities in the pilot areas, and for the refunding of fees in specific circumstances. It would also provide for the Secretary of State to intervene when he considers that excessive fees are being charged.</p>
	<p pid="d.217.1/7">New clause 46 provides that regulations may provide for the sharing of information between designated persons and planning authorities in pilot areas, and with the Secretary of State. Amendment 75 provides that new clauses 43 to 46 come into force on Royal Assent. Those new clauses will allow us to test, in specific areas of the country and for a limited period, the benefits of allowing planning applicants to choose who processes their planning application. That will lead to a more efficient and effective planning system, better able to secure the development of the homes and other facilities that our communities need and want. Introducing choice for the applicant enables them to shop around for the services that best meet their needs. It will enable innovation in service provision, bringing new resources into the planning system and driving down costs while improving performance.</p>

	<p pid="d.219.0/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about the planning clauses of the Bill, even at this late hour. The Bill represents a very significant rolling back of the policies of localism introduced by the last Government, who sought to give local communities more control over both planning policy and local planning decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/2">Planning is a progressive discipline. It is the mechanism we have for brokering the differences between individual interests and collective community needs, ensuring that those who profit from development contribute to meeting the needs of the communities in which they are building, and protecting the things that we hold dear&#8212;whether local heritage, natural habitats, special views or simply the character and diversity of our local high street or neighbourhood.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/3">The Government like to blame the planning system for the failure to deliver new homes, but objective evidence suggests that it is not the right target. On planning, the Government show again and again that they have an inaccurate analysis and a long-term plan that does not work. The number of homes being granted planning permission each year is about 230,000. That does need to increase, but it is not too far off the 250,000 homes we need in order to begin to make inroads on the housing crisis.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/4">Yet if we look at the number of homes being delivered, either by starts or completions, we see that both stand at about 130,000. Recent research by <i>The Guardian</i> has revealed that the nine house builders in the FTSE 100 are sitting on enough land to build 600,000 homes. Against a backdrop of increased planning consents and continued deregulation, house building starts fell by 14% between April and June of last year.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/5">The Government&#8217;s response is to seek to deregulate the planning system further, curiously through a series of centralising measures that will take control away from local communities and make it harder&#8212;not easier&#8212;to deliver new development. At a Communities and Local Government Committee meeting before the Christmas recess, the Minister for Housing and Planning mentioned a development in his own constituency of 900 homes that is being built out over 15 years. That frustratingly slow speed of delivery has nothing to do with the local planning system and much to do with a Government who simply lack the political will to increase the rate of home building to deliver what is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/6">The Government&#8217;s cuts to local government funding are clearly having a negative impact on planning departments across the country, and I am pleased that Ministers appear to have accepted the arguments that I and other Opposition Members made during the Bill Committee stage: that councils should be able to operate a charging regime for planning services that enables them to recover the true cost of providing the service. Subject to the detail to be set out in the regulations, that should enable councils to resource their planning departments properly, even in a context of continued cuts to their overall funding. Further, it will help to ensure that under-resourced planning departments do not present a blockage to new homes being built. It will enable applicants to be sure of receiving a good level of service and more swift decisions, and help to scale up the level of planning permissions being granted to meet the need we have for new homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/7">Notwithstanding this welcome change of heart, there remain very significant concerns about the planning clauses in the Bill. The Government have introduced new clause 43 very late in the day so that it has not been subject to proper scrutiny by the Public Bill Committee. The new clause introduces the outsourcing of planning applications. It is potentially very damaging. It weakens the accountability of local planning services and removes with one hand the fees that the Government are enabling local authorities to raise with another. Fundamentally, it is a solution to a symptom of the problem of the disproportionate effect of local government cuts on planning departments. This symptom will be alleviated by the proper resourcing that a new system of fees will facilitate. I therefore urge the Government to rethink this proposal, which simply undermines local planning departments.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/8">The Government further undermine local planning authorities with the imposition of two very strong duties in relation to starter homes. Local planning authorities will have a duty to promote starter homes and ensure that they are delivered on all reasonably sized sites, with provision for the Secretary of State to intervene via a compliance direction if the local authority fails to comply with these duties. Local authorities have no such duties in relation to any other form of housing. Their responsibilities on housing relate entirely to assessing local need and delivering a range of housing to meet that need. It is therefore an extraordinary form of centralisation to impose such strong duties in relation to one particular form of housing.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/9">In Committee, I raised repeatedly concerns about permission in principle. In 18 years working as a town planner, I saw so often that the acceptability of the principle of development to a local authority and to a local community is dependent on aspects of the detail. Issues such as the density and height of the development, the size of the homes proposed, design quality standards, or&#8212;on everyone&#8217;s minds in the current context&#8212;flood risk mitigation are not technical details. They may be informed by technical studies, but they form part of the fine-grain set of judgments that a local planning authority makes as to whether a site is suitable for a housing development. Permission in principle, as far as we can tell, will not set any parameters other than land use and quantum of development. A developer will know that housing can be built on the site but not what size or type or what the design and quality standards must be, and importantly, unless they have made their own investigations, they will not necessarily know anything about the land on which they want to build. Permission in principle therefore offers very little to developers, but it also offers nothing to communities. As a consequence, it will fail to speed up the pace of development and the delivery of new homes.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/10">Let us take, for example, a brownfield site in a historic town centre. It might be possible to judge without too much detailed information that 10 housing units could be developed on the site, and permission in principle could therefore be given, but there may be archaeological remains below the ground, and issues such as the massing of development and the style of the architecture might be absolutely critical in determining whether development on the site is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/11">Another example might be a local plan approved in 2012 that identifies a site for 800 residential units on the edge of a town, based on typical local vernacular designs of two and three-storey houses. Because it is in the local plan and has been added to the brownfield register, the site will be granted permission in principle. A technical details consent is then submitted that identifies that 70% of the land cannot be built on because of subsidence issues which were not known about at the time of the local plan allocation, as a ground condition survey would not have been carried out for each site in the local plan. Since the permission in principle contains the quantum of development, the 800 units are to be crammed on to 30% of the site, creating an overly dense development entirely unsuited to its context, with heights of up to 15 storeys. Local members cannot refuse it on design, sustainability or layout reasons, as the permission in principle states that having 800 units is acceptable. Permission in principle will weaken the powers of local authorities to refuse unsustainable or poorly designed developments, and erode the power of local communities to take part in the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/12">Fundamentally, this Bill has no vision for planning. It does not harness the planning system as a tool for delivering the homes and infrastructure we so desperately need. It weakens our plan-led system and erodes the ability of the planning system to deliver high-quality, beautiful, sustainable places.</p>
	<p pid="d.219.0/13">We need to deliver new homes in large numbers and very fast to meet demand, but we also need to build attractive, successful and sustainable places that will become much-loved communities and a part of the heritage of the future. We cannot achieve that without a planning system that prioritises place making, design standards and sustainability, and that involves communities properly in taking decisions about the future of their areas.</p>

	<p pid="d.221.0/1">I have tabled two sets of amendments to deal with concerns about the operation of the planning system. Those concerns are shared by a number of my right hon. and hon. Friends, who support the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="d.221.0/2">New clause 48 addresses the fact that neighbourhood plans can be undermined by speculative developments that are granted planning permission but that run contrary to those plans. Neighbourhood planning has been a great achievement on the part of this Government, who have given communities power. Often neighbourhoods plan for far more houses than they originally intended or were allocated. Responsibility for the plans has been transferred to neighbourhoods and they are popular, but support for them relies on their integrity, and that support is undermined when speculative developers try to get in applications ahead of the completion of neighbourhood plans or even after they have been completed. They bang in their applications, and either they are upheld by the local authority, which is fearful of losing an appeal, or the developer makes an appeal that is upheld by the planning inspector. The development is then allowed to go ahead, which leads people, including groups of volunteers, to ask, &#8220;Why have we spent literally years working on this neighbourhood plan for where developments should go&#8212;a power that was given to us, the community&#8212;only for it to be overturned by a developer?&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="d.222.0/1">So many people in towns such as Buntingford and the villages in my constituency spend so much time surveying opinion and considering all the aspects of the heritage of their village in order to come up with a neighbourhood plan for their community. Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is wrong that that can then be trashed by an application by a speculative developer? These plans need to have a proper place and proper respect.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.222.3" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11377" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="222"  time="024:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0006.htm#160105-0006.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="d.222.3/1">I strongly agree with my hon. Friend. The whole point of the policy of localism and neighbourhood planning is that people are told explicitly that they will have control and be able to determine where development goes and protect land that they do not allocate for development for a period of, say, 15 years of the life of the plan. If that is overturned very quickly, or even as they complete their plan or just before it is passed by a referendum, that undermines confidence in the whole policy of localism. That is bad for the policy of neighbourhood planning and for the Government&#8217;s policy of localism. It means a return to a system of planning by appeal and a developer-led system, which undermines support for new housing, when what we want is a plan-led system. For all of those reasons, the policy that allows speculative developers to creep in at the last moment and undermine plans is wrong. That loophole needs to be closed.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.3/2">Developers have the right to appeal against planning permission that is refused, but the community has no right of appeal, which is part of the problem. The only recourse is to invite the Secretary of State to call in an application that appears to run contrary to national policy, but that is very much a last resort. Many of us have been grateful to the Secretary of State when he has been willing to do that because something appears to have gone wrong in a local area, but that is not a process on which we necessarily want to rely.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.3/3">Before the election, I and others proposed a community right of appeal, which commanded a lot of support in this House. We are now proposing a more limited, neighbourhood right of appeal. That would give communities or defined people in a community, such as a parish council, the ability to mount appeals against speculative planning applications that are granted if they run contrary to a neighbourhood plan or an emerging neighbourhood plan that is very close to being completed. That would allow a form of redress and introduce a check into the system. It would send a clear signal to developers that the abuse of the neighbourhood planning process is no longer allowed.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.3/4">A number of organisations, including the Campaign to Protect Rural England and Civic Voice, support the proposed neighbourhood right of appeal, which I think would create a sensible balance in the planning system and strengthen the very good policy of neighbourhood planning.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.3/5">The second set of amendments contains amendments 80 to 87 to clause 115, which places a new duty on local authorities to report on the financial benefits of proposed developments. The problem with the clause is that it is not balanced by any duty to assess the costs of proposed developments. It undermines public support for new housing when people see that inadequate infrastructure is provided to support it. If people are already concerned about access to the local school of their choice, the congestion on local roads, the waiting times at their local GP surgery or even more immediate and profound things such as the ability of the sewerage system to cope with increased development, which has been an issue in my constituency, and additional infrastructure is not provided when new housing is built, thereby exacerbating those problems, it undermines the support for new housing. If we address the infrastructure deficit more effectively, it will build support for the new housing that is so desperately needed to give people the chance to get a foot on the housing ladder.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.3/6">This set of amendments would simply require local authorities, as well as assessing the benefits of proposed developments, to assess the costs. Those costs would include the infrastructure costs. This proposal would not prevent development, but it would require a proper assessment of the costs, which is not otherwise being done. There is a problem in that local authorities have a shared responsibility in this area. The local authorities that are granting planning permissions or making plans are not always the same authorities that are responsible for providing the elements of infrastructure, which are often county councils. Policy is not joined up in that respect. There have been repeated attempts through guidance and assurances to address infrastructure concerns, but they have not been adequate to meet local concerns. These amendments would again provide a reasonable balance in the system.</p>
	<p pid="d.222.3/7">I hope that the Minister will consider my amendments favourably. If he is unable to accept them, I hope that he will at least say what he proposes to do to address the very legitimate concern on the part of local communities that if development must come, it should first be in accordance with neighbourhood plans and secondly be matched with suitable infrastructure to support it.</p>

	<p pid="d.224.0/1">I signed the amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11377" name="Nick Herbert">the right hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on the necessity of demonstrating to communities how the infrastructure requirements of any development will be completed and carried out. I agree with him that the greatest concerns that people have about developments, whether they be in small villages, city centres or suburban areas, is what the impact will be on local traffic arrangements, whether local public transport will be provided, whether there will be sufficient capacity in doctors&#8217; surgeries and schools, and whether the water and sewerage systems will be capable of dealing with the demands of the developments. All those things are extremely important. Currently, there seems to be no automatic way in which a planning authority has to reassure communities that those issues will be taken account of when it approves a planning application.</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/2">I draw the House&#8217;s attention to a report that the Communities and Local Government Committee produced in the last Parliament, in which we looked at the operation of the national planning policy framework during its first two or three years. Recommendation 11 stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/3">&#8220;In setting out the reasons for approving development, decision-makers should fully explain the consideration they have given to its impact on infrastructure and explain how and where they expect the infrastructure to be provided, and to what timetable.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/4">In other words, if an application is to be approved, it should be clearly laid out that a planning authority has considered how the infrastructure associated with, needed and required by that development will be provided, who will pay for it, and to what timetable it will be produced.</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/5">The Committee&#8217;s recommendation seems entirely consistent with the amendment and the need to ensure that infrastructure is put in place. Planners should demonstrate&#8212;as should a planning committee when taking a decision&#8212;that those costs will be identified and the infrastructure provided, to allay the fears that many communities rightly have. In practice that infrastructure does not follow&#8212;a planning application is agreed, but that community will have problems because of the lack of infrastructure associated with the development. It would be good if the Minister would at least take on board the spirit of the amendment and see how it can be reflected. Everyone agrees that infrastructure requirements from planning permission should be followed through, but the real question is how that should be done.</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/6">New clause 31 deals with the definition of affordable housing. The Minister will say that &#163;450,000 in London and &#163;250,000 outside London is a top limit, but houses up to that limit will be regarded as affordable. Interestingly, subsection (5) states:</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/7">&#8220;The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this section so as to modify the definition of &#8220;affordable housing&#8221;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/8">In other words, &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; is no longer what people can afford, but what the Government say people can afford. If the Government do not find themselves producing enough affordable housing under the current definition, they do not have to build more houses; they simply have to change the definition so that more houses are covered by it. The Minister is getting into a bit of a fantasy world, but unfortunately the Government are operating in the real world.</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/9">The current planning system is essentially this Government&#8217;s system. They completely revised the NPPF, and when the Select Committee considered that there was general support for the overall intention, but concern about some of the details. The Government have announced their intention to make further amendments to the NPPF, which the Committee will consider, and I am pleased that the Government have extended the consultation period for that. They have changed rules on permitted developments and given themselves extra powers to ensure that planning applications are dealt with in a certain period. Now, however, without any real consultation, and with a short period of notice as the new clause was produced just before Christmas, new clause 43 is effectively about the privatisation of the planning service. That is what it potentially amounts to after pilots have been brought in.</p>
	<p pid="d.224.0/10">Let me explore what that might mean. Does it mean that an individual or organisation that submits a planning application will be free to shop around for whichever alternative provider they think can give them the best chance of getting a planning application accepted? Will they be able to look at the track record of providers around the country?</p>

	<p pid="d.225.0/1">I believe the new clause makes it clear that the third-party providers will handle the processing but not the determination. The new providers will provide speed and efficiency, but decision making will remain where it currently is&#8212;with elected members and officers.</p>

	<p pid="d.225.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the process and discussions between an applicant and an officer dealing with that application will have no impact at all on whether permission is given, he is mistaken. Process is important, and how an applicant engages with a planning officer can lead to an eventual decision on the application. Just because a committee may make the final decision and say yes or no, the idea that the process has no role to play in shaping that eventual final decision is fundamentally wrong.</p>

	<p pid="d.225.3/1">It is extremely worrying. The second point I was going to make is that we can all have views on occasions when the planning system does not work as well as it should, but nevertheless planning officers in a local authority have some understanding of their community&#8212;how it operates, what its needs are, who should be consulted and who should be involved in the process. My experience is that while there may be a minimum requirement on consultation, very often, as an application is considered, extra consultation is undertaken beyond that which is actually required to ensure the views of communities and different interested parties are taken into account. My worry here is that someone parachuted in from outside, with no knowledge of an area but a track record of dealing with applications quickly, may not be as sensitive to the needs of a local community. If I was a local MP in an area with particular planning pressures and had concerns about getting those decisions right, I would start to be very worried about the scenario that is developing.</p>
	<p pid="d.225.3/2">The point has been made that in the end decisions will be left to the planning authority. What does that mean? Many authorities now delegate a lot of less important decisions about schemes that are not major&#8212;individual extensions to an individual property, for example&#8212;to officers. Will decisions be delegated to an alternative provider, or will the alternative provider have to make a recommendation to a planning officer to take the delegated decision? The proposal is very unclear. What is the situation? If the delegated decision is taken by an alternative provider, the decision is not taken with any local democratic input whatever. Or, if a delegated decision is passed on to a council officer, who pays for the time of that officer? The fee will have all gone to the alternative provider.</p>
	<p pid="d.225.3/3">Let us come on to the decision that goes to a committee. Who writes the committee report? Will the alternative provider write the report and put the pros and cons of the application for councillors to decide, or will it be a council officer? If it is a council officer, who pays for the council officer&#8217;s time? To what extent will there be liaison between the officer and the alternative provider? If it is not the council officer, an alternative provider is going to be appointed by the applicant to write the report for members of the planning committee. Does anyone think this might not affect the decision-making process? Of course it could.</p>

	<p pid="d.226.1/1">That would be a very interesting decision. When recommendations are made to councillors, very often reasons are given as part of the officer&#8217;s report. If councillors follow those reasons, they would expect them to have a defensible case if an appeal was lodged. If the advice to councillors was wrong, however, it may be the council that incurs costs. Who is liable for those costs? I am not sure that that is spelled out either.</p>
	<p pid="d.226.1/2">As I understand it, there is a requirement to share information between an alternative provider and the council. Presumably, the council is taking no fee&#8212;all the fee goes to the alternative provider&#8212;so who provides the council&#8217;s costs? We have already heard that planning departments have had just about the largest cuts of any section of local government in the past five years. This is a service that has had major cuts. It will now have to continue to do some of the work on these schemes with no benefit at all from the fee, which means less resources for the planning department.</p>
	<p pid="d.226.1/3">This matter ought to have been given a great deal more consideration. It has come in on Report with very little time to consider it. I have just raised some concerns about who, ultimately, will be responsible for extra costs, recommendations to the committee, writing reports and getting involved in delegated decisions. None of that appears to be covered by the clauses before us. I hope the Minister can give us some answers, because this is a worrying proposal that could undermine the accountability of the planning process to local communities.</p>

	<p pid="d.227.0/1">I rise to support new clause 58, which is a brilliant amendment designed to fulfil our ambition to be the greenest Government ever. It would apply to only 345,191 grade II listed buildings in England, which would be freed to add insulation and solar panels and make other environmentally important improvements without needing to go through the listed building consent process currently required for any alteration to a listed building or within the curtilage of that building. It would free up hard-working conservation officers and reduce costs and red tape, while ensuring that all the historical features protected by the listing remain protected and under the current restrictions.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.0/2">The new clause would also remove the curtilage catch-all and deter homeowners who can afford to turn up the heating but must not. Instead, they could do better things to help fight climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. It is only a tiny amendment, so, not surprisingly, it is opposed by Historic England, which fears that the odd feature it has forgotten to list might be, what&#8212;insulated? It knows that things have to change and that we need to follow the success of the climate talks in Paris with practical changes. If the Government have a better way of delivering the curtilage removal, I will gladly withdraw the amendment and thank them on behalf of all our children and grandchildren.</p>

	<p pid="d.227.1/1">I rise to support my amendment 74. One of the many reasons I oppose the Bill is that it takes power away from local communities and places it in the hands of private sector developers and central Government. It is a profoundly undemocratic Bill, and nowhere is that clearer than in the plans for planning authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/2">Essentially, the Bill will mean that local people have no say over developments in their neighbourhoods. The introduction of permission in principle will allow automatic planning permission on sites allocated for development without any scrutiny of the fine detail. Neither local authorities nor the public could object to development on these sites. It is the very opposite of the kind of democratically accountable local planning essential for sustainable development and the delivery of economic, environmental and social benefits. If I hear the Government say again that they are champions of localism, I will scream, because I cannot see how that is remotely consistent with a Bill that is all about taking power away from local planning authorities, local people and local scrutiny and placing it in private hands and the hands of Ministers. For that reason, my amendment would delete clause 111 altogether, getting rid of permission in principle.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/3">I believe that local communities are best placed to understand the particular needs and detailed characteristics of their local area, but if such oversight is sidelined, we risk significantly compromising community resilience. I support the position set out by the hon. Member for</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/4">Dulwich and West Norwood (Helen Hayes), who spoke eloquently on this issue, pointing out the poor timing of this debate: we are discussing removing local knowledge from the planning system at a time when we are all deeply concerned about flooding and when the past month alone has shown us the importance of flood-risk appraisals when granting permission for development. It would be particularly foolish to remove those now.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/5">Moreover, nothing in the Bill will limit permission in principle to brownfield sites alone or prevent it from being applied to any development on any land allocated in a so-called qualifying document. The consequences are far reaching. As the Town and Country Planning Association has pointed out, fracking could easily be given permission in principle as part of a minerals plan, which would be completely unacceptable. I am glad that Labour Members share my concern about permission in principle and the extent to which it undermines local democracy. I support their proposed measures to mitigate the associated damage, but I hope they will go further and support my amendment, which would delete the clause completely. I am pleased to see the amendments that are designed to create a right of appeal for locally interested parties and neighbourhood planning bodies against decisions to grant planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/6">Once again we see a Government who are not facing up to where the real problems are. When it comes to building much needed and truly affordable housing, it is not our planning process that is to blame for delays in delivery. We have heard from others in this Chamber about the size of land banks currently held by some of the biggest developers. It is simply not the case that the problem lies with the planning authorities. Instead of real problems being tackled, what we are seeing is essentially a power grab by central Government, which will not fix the housing crisis.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/7">Finally, let me simply say that I share the concerns raised about new clause 43. Let us fund planning departments properly rather than undermine them still further. What we are seeing, as others have said, is essentially the privatisation of the planning system, destroying the last shreds of the democratic process that safeguards how our communities are made, putting power instead in the hands of developers. Dr Colenutt, a planning expert at the University of Northampton, has clearly said that this will replace a public sector ethos with a developer-led ethos. He points out that the designated persons are likely to be consultants who also work for the private sector. That introduces probable bias, reduces the public scrutiny trail still further and is likely to reduce the right of the public to comment on planning applications.</p>
	<p pid="d.227.1/8">Local planning authorities are starved of funds. If the problem that the Government are trying to solve is that planning authorities are too slow, let us give them the funds to operate properly, not strip away their capacity. If we are serious about localism, let us ensure that control over our planning system remains with local authorities and local people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.228.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24814" speakername="Martin Vickers" colnum="228"  time="025:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0006.htm#160105-0006.htm_spnew20">
	<p pid="d.228.0/1">I shall speak to new clauses 40 and 41, which stand in my name and those of some of my hon. Friends. To some extent, the proposals follow on from the ten-minute rule Bill that I introduced last January and are designed to bring a greater element of fairness to the planning system, while giving our local communities a greater say in their future. It could indeed be described as localism in action. Many of the proposals are in line with those advocated a few minutes ago by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11377" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/2">Our constituents often and in very large numbers oppose planning applications that they feel would change the character of their village or the part of town in which they live and to which they feel very attached. Campaigns build up and residents groups are formed, but at the conclusion many people rightly feel aggrieved&#8212;they know that the decision would not have gone against them had they been the applicant, who of course has the right of appeal. For the objectors, it is the end of the line. How can it be fair for only one party to have the right of appeal?</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/3">This feeling is particularly evident when the local planning authority has no adopted local plans in place. In reality, this means that the democratic process has let people down. The local council might well have turned down an application, but without a local plan in place, it would then find it almost impossible to defend the decision in front of a planning inspector, particularly when the applicant appeared with lawyers, expert witnesses and all the resources needed to ensure a successful outcome.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/4">I do not suggest that every planning application that has attracted objections should automatically have the right of appeal. It is possible to argue that case, but in reality an application to extend a home by building a conservatory, for example, might irritate a neighbour, but it will not change the whole character of an area. If, however, the development of a new housing estate is approved, that could change a semi-rural, edge-of-town parish into an extension of the town itself. Strategic gaps between town and country are vitally important.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/5">In my ten-minute rule Bill, I suggested that a hard-copy petition from local residents should be able to trigger an appeal to the planning inspector. What should the threshold be? I suggested 10% at that time, but I am not hung up on the mechanics; it is the principle I would like to hear the Government concede.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/6">Something must be done to protect residents when they have been let down by their local authority. Such a situation exists in the part of my constituency where North East Lincolnshire Council is the planning authority. Residents have suffered for many years because there is no up-to-date local plan and it will be at least another year before such a plan exists. That is unacceptable and leaves villages such as Humberston, New Waltham, Waltham, Laceby and Habrough open to a stream of applications. Some of those applications might be speculative, but they cause endless discontent among local people.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/7">It is not necessarily the quality of the proposals that is in question, but the fact that local services and infrastructure are inadequate&#8212;school places, GP services and so on. There is a point at which the whole character of an area can be changed and strategic gaps between town and country may disappear. It is only right that local residents should have an opportunity to appeal.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/8">If the Government reject a wider right for objectors to go to appeal, the very least they could do is allow parish councils the opportunity to lodge an objection with the inspectorate for significant-sized developments. Too often their opinions are squeezed out. I do not seek to stop development. We all appreciate that we need new homes, but we need them in locations that carry the full blessing of local people.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/9">Of course there must be a balance. The system must not stifle development or become a tool to promote nimbyism. My new clauses are designed not to prevent building, but merely to allow development in locations that carry a broad measure of public support. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it is a matter of fairness. Of course the appeal may be lost, but both sides will have had the same opportunities to argue their case.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/10">The new clauses are an opportunity to extend the claim that we are the real party of localism. We must do more to involve local people in shaping their communities&#8212;indeed, some local people know better than the planners. We need only consider some of the properties built in high-risk flood areas: had more notice been taken of those who serve on internal drainage boards or as flood wardens, or members of the farming community, and had they had a second opportunity to contribute, we might have had better decision making.</p>
	<p pid="d.228.0/11">The Government have done and are doing a great deal to help. They are ensuring that in future local plans are delivered in a more timely way and they offer support for producing neighbourhood plans, but that only goes so far. Parish councils and neighbourhood groups find that their resources are limited. It is not just financial support that can help them produce such plans&#8212;they need the expertise of an experienced official. What I want to hear from the Minister when he sums up&#8212;always assuming that he is not going to congratulate me on a far-sighted, well-crafted new clause that the Government feel obliged to accept&#8212;is that through existing structures, within the context of the Bill and with appropriate guidance to planning authorities and inspectors, the same result can be achieved.</p>

	<p pid="d.230.0/1">I am going to speak in support of a number of new clauses and amendments and speak briefly to the Government&#8217;s new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/2">New clause 50 would incorporate minimum space standards in building regulations for new dwellings in England. It seeks to ensure that new homes are of a high standard and are built with the realities of day-to-day life in mind.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/3">In October 2015, the Government introduced a new housing standard called the national described space standard. That was supposed to improve the quality of new-build housing by ensuring that it was built to an adequate size. Unfortunately, it is voluntary and too complicated for most authorities to introduce.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/4">Royal Institute of British Architects research shows that more than half of new homes being built today are not big enough to meet the needs of the people who buy them. The squeeze on the size of our houses is depriving thousands of families of the space needed for them to live comfortably. Moreover, establishing the standard within building regulations could minimise the bureaucracy at a local level and mean that councils had a ready-made measure that they could adopt. It is a straightforward proposal and I hope that even at this late hour the Minister will tell us that he is going to adopt it.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/5">New clause 51 would allow local authorities to develop a planning fees schedule that would enable the full costs of processing planning applications to be recovered. Since 2010, local authorities&#8217; spending on planning has almost halved, falling from &#163;2.2 billion then to &#163;1.2 billion this year. That decline is second only to the decline in spending on cultural services. We heard from the Royal Town Planning Institute, which gave oral evidence to the Select Committee, that it believed that councils should be allowed to recoup the full costs of providing planning services. The point has rightly been made that good, well-run planning departments contribute to economic growth and development, and that they should be supported in that role.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/6">The issue of overstretched local authorities was raised several times on Second Reading and in Committee. Local planning departments are experiencing reduced resources and greater pressure, as well as increasing insecurity, because people do not know when the next round of Government cuts will cause them to lose their jobs. The only way in which to address that is to ensure that planning departments have the resources that will enable them to work effectively.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/7">I am pleased to note that what we said during all that time in Committee did not fall on completely deaf ears. Ministers appear to agree with us, in theory, that planning needs additional resources. However, new clause 45 is such a poor execution of that notion that it might as well not be there. We must ask why the Government have acknowledged the need for the full recovery of planning fee costs, but will allow that to happen only when the service is contracted out. Why have they not considered allowing local planning departments to do the same? What can they possibly mean by increased devolution if they do not even trust local planning authorities to set their own fees? I hope that the Minister will do something about that tonight.</p>
	<p pid="d.230.0/8">New clause 57 would empower local planning authorities to impose a planning obligation when giving permission for the construction of new housing for sale by requiring a proportion of the housing to be marketed exclusively to local first-time buyers.</p>

	<p pid="d.231.0/1">My hon. Friend will know how fed up Londoners are with the current record low level of home building and what a con the Government&#8217;s &#163;450,000 starter homes are, but is she aware of the scale of the problem caused by developers selling homes in London to investors in Asia and the middle east before they have been completed and made available for purchase by Londoners? Will the new clause go some way towards ending that scandal?</p>

	<p pid="d.231.1/1">My right hon. Friend has made an excellent point. We are, of course, entirely aware of that issue, which affects those in London and elsewhere. New clause 57 would enable a proportion of new homes to be held back exclusively for Londoners, or local people elsewhere, who wanted to buy their first homes. Anyone who supports the ability of Londoners to buy their own homes must surely support the new clause. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will want to ask <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24911" name="Zac Goldsmith">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith)</phrase> whether he will support it, given that it seeks to ensure that a number of new properties in London and elsewhere go to local first-time buyers. We know that this is a particular issue in London, because so many of the new properties are sold off plan to overseas investors before local people have a chance to enter the housing market.</p>

	<p pid="d.232.0/1">May I just make clear that I have nothing against foreigners? Some of my best friends and the families whom I know are foreigners. However, this is about fairness, and about giving first dibs to Londoners.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-01-05d.232.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="232"  time="025:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160105/debtext/160105-0006.htm#160105-0006.htm_spnew25">
	<p pid="d.232.1/1">Absolutely, and that is what new clause 57 seeks to do, for Londoners and for a percentage of local people in all areas of the country where there is acute housing pressure. We want to ensure that some new housing is reserved, at least for a period, so that local people have a chance to get on to the housing ladder.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/2">Amendment 100 would ensure permission in principle is limited to housing on brownfield land in England. We know that the Government&#8217;s productivity plan indicated that the proposals for permission in principle would relate specifically to brownfield land, but the Bill itself places no such limitations upon it.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/3">In Committee the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/4">&#8220;We intend to limit the type of development that can be granted permission in principle to housing-led development&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Housing and Planning Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2015-12-03">3 December 2015</phrase>; c. 545.]</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/5">but we cannot see those limits in the Bill as it stands. As the Bill proposes such a major change to the planning system, and as permission in principle brings about a bypassing of the way in which local people can have their say in planning decisions, it is very important that we hear more from the Minister tonight about how permission in principle will act in practice. We know that there are now a number of different ways in which planning applications can be assessed and planning permission can be given. It has become very complicated and it is increasingly difficult for local people to be able to participate in the planning system because of these various routes. It is also a problem for developers and we would like to hear a bit more from the Minister this evening about how it is going to operate in practice.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/6">Amendments 101 and 102 would ensure that communities continue to have a say on decisions that affect them through their local planning committees and local plan process. It asks that permission in principle and technical details consent will be subject to consultation with local authorities and their communities. Again, this is a straightforward amendment to ensure more say is given to local people in planning applications that affect them.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/7">Amendment 70 would ensure that permission in principle would expire when the plan that relates to that permission is no longer relevant if the development has not already taken place. Clause 111 appears to confirm that permission in principle can outlast the plan that created the permission, and this raises questions about how, in the absence of a plan, the technical details stage can be determined. Again, this is a straightforward amendment. It simply removes one word from clause 111, but has far-reaching consequences in ensuring there is a time limit, at least to some extent, for permission in principle.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/8">Amendment 71 suggests that material considerations should be able to overturn permission in principle where those material considerations could not have been foreseen beforehand. We had an interesting discussion in Committee about this, and the Minister&#8217;s response was that the permission in principle should give upfront certainty on the core matters underpinning the suitability of the site, namely its use, location and the amount of development, and allow matters of detail to be agreed subsequently. Our point in the amendment is that if something emerges that could not have been known at that material consideration technical detail stage, how will permission in principle be overturned when the legislation simply does not allow that to happen?</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/9">Amendment 72 seeks to ensure that there is some certainty for communities and developers. Permission in principle would last only for a period of five years to ensure it does not contribute to land-banking.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/10">Amendment 103 would insert an explicit duty in clause 112 so that it considers sustainable development and place-making when sites are included on a local register of land. We think that that is very important, and that is why we wanted to ensure that amendment 70 was discussed this evening. Land that is on the register should conform to place-making and sustainable development obligations, because we know that too often place-making objectors fall off the agenda. In Committee, the Minister suggested that the national planning policy framework covered all those issues. Well, if it does, there will be no harm in putting them into the Bill as well, because they will already conform to Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/11">Amendment 104 seeks to ensure that when urban development corporations introduce new garden cities, as in the case of Ebbsfleet, those cities should conform to garden city principles. We believe that this is really important. A place cannot simply be turned into a garden city by calling it a garden city. If it is going to be a garden city, it should conform to the principles of having a strong vision, community engagement, community ownership of land, mixed tenure of homes, employment opportunities, beautiful and imaginatively designed homes, green spaces, opportunities for residents to grow their own food, strong communities and so on. If that is what the Government intend for their new garden cities, will they please put some detail about what those cities should be like into the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/12">New clause 49 will give councils the power of direction in relation to publicly owned land, to enable it to be brought forward more quickly to support redevelopment or regeneration opportunities. We all know that, in certain circumstances, there is a need to speed up the process of the assembly of surplus land.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/13">We have a real issue with a number of the Government&#8217;s new clauses, and I want to reiterate some of the points that other Members have made about them. The new clauses relating to planning were tabled extremely late, over the Christmas period. There was no opportunity to discuss any of them in Committee, yet they will introduce fundamental and systemic changes to our planning system. It is not us on the Opposition Benches who have been incompetent in the management of this legislation. The Government simply should not be producing so many important, far-reaching clauses at this stage of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/14">Government new clause 31 introduces a new definition of affordable housing that includes starter homes. We object strongly to starter homes being included in that definition of affordable housing. In fact, many Opposition Members have said that it will render the term &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; useless. It is also a travesty that there can be no real scrutiny of these new clauses, and that we will have to leave it to the other place to carry out that role.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/15">We take a similar view of Government new clauses 43 to 45, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10045" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> has said amount to a privatisation of the planning process. That is what we think they will do. They will require local authorities to contract out at least some of the processing of their planning applications in order to give developers some ability to choose who processes their planning application. I cannot believe that the Government are serious about this. I know that they tend to carry out pilots, but they must realise that the potential for this mechanism to generate a degree of corruption and totally inappropriate conflicts of interest is probably endless. These new clauses need to be subjected to a degree of scrutiny that will not be possible this evening. It has not been possible for the planning agencies that will be affected by the changes to have a say or to have any input into the process. That is quite frankly disgraceful, because these will be huge changes to the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/16">Although we can see that new clauses 32 to 36 attempt to ensure that more land comes forward for development, we think they are draconian. They force a range of public bodies to give up land for development, whether or not it seems to be appropriate, because there will be a requirement for them to reduce the amount of estate they hold. Again, it would have been useful to have had these clauses tabled earlier, so that we could have examined them in more detail in Committee. That job will again have to be left to the other place.</p>
	<p pid="d.232.1/17">Finally, in addition to Opposition Members having real problems about the direction of the Government&#8217;s planning policies, some Government Members clearly have issues with the way in which local communities will have very little say in planning decisions that affect them. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24814" name="Martin Vickers">The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11377" name="Nick Herbert">the right hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> have tabled interesting new clauses that seek to ensure that local authorities, through parish councils or neighbourhood plans, have a greater right of appeal on planning decisions. We would seek to support those new clauses, and I hope the Minister takes them on board this evening. With that, I shall conclude my comments, after merely saying to the Minister that the planning system that he is putting in place will be his planning system, and we will judge him on it in the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="d.234.0/1">I was lucky enough to be chosen by the Whips to serve on the Bill Committee, and one great chink of light in the tunnel of that seemingly interminable yet fascinating debate was that one knew that we had Ministers who were listening to us on the Back Benches. I therefore say to the Chairman of the Select Committee and to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr Blackman-Woods)</phrase> that it is quite wrong to say that Government new clauses 43 to 46 were suddenly dropped in today. This idea was spoken about several times in Committee, but most notably in the stand part debate on clause 102.</p>
	<p pid="d.234.0/2">I want to address some of the issues that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10045" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> raised in a moment, but the reason why I particularly asked the Minister to think about this&#8212;he promised to do so and has therefore brought these clauses back today&#8212;was in direct contradiction to what <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24910" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> said. She may be right that the planning system is not the only problem with generating new housing, but I cannot be the only Member of this House who has met local architects and local small developers, and forced the chief executive of the local council to come to a meeting because the failure of the planning department was stopping economic development and stopping housing being built. I am not talking about building by large developers or people sitting on land banks, but about building by small developers. That point was raised absolutely in Committee, when I, along with several of its members, asked the Minister to think about it.</p>
	<p pid="d.234.0/3">I accept that this is a pilot and that there may or may not be some problems, but the Minister has clearly set out in these new clauses what he is aiming to do, which is to have not privatisation but competition between some planning authorities&#8212;and it is likely to be local planning authorities. As a London borough Member, I have encountered a development on a piece of land that is split between two local authorities, one of which is dragging its heels with the planning process. The application is now therefore going to the other local planning authority for it to move the process forward. If we want to generate the building of more housing, and we do, for it is a stated aim of this Government, it is not unreasonable to get some competition into the process, not the decision.</p>
	<p pid="d.234.0/4">This Government and the Minister&#8217;s proposals are in no way undermining localism and the trust that is being put in local planning committees or local planning officers, who will make the final decision under delegated powers. We are seeking to allow small-scale developers to make applications and to get those processed more quickly. Opposition Members may have a number of reservations about that, but Government Members will be thanking the Minister for listening and introducing these new clauses, because they will give substantial help in reaching the target that we want small-scale developers to achieve. I urge the Minister to continue to reject the arguments made by the hon. Member for City of Durham.</p>
	<p pid="d.234.0/5">I would have spoken to new clauses 32 and 36 but, having looked at the time, I think the House will probably benefit from my sitting down.</p>

	<p pid="d.235.0/1">I hope that I can trespass on the House&#8217;s time for a little while to offer perhaps a starter and a bonus as far as the Bill is concerned. I am talking about the discrete issue of nationally significant infrastructure projects, and in particular about clause 116 and amendment 78, which stands in my name. The bonus is that it deals with fairness in relation to land compensation, which is something that we have talked about on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid="d.235.0/2">The particular issue is this: under clause 116, the development consent orders, which are part of the nationally significant infrastructure project regime, are extended beyond the infrastructure projects themselves to related housing development. It can be housing development that is adjacent or linked to the scheme. Equally, it can be housing development that is physically very close to the scheme. I do not have a problem with that, and there will be a number of instances where the creation of a piece of infrastructure either opens up land sensibly for access to development for housing or may sever land that might be farmland or similar from the rest of the agricultural holding. In that case, it is more sensible then to use it for housing as it is not viable as an agricultural unit or some other type of business unit. There is no problem there.</p>
	<p pid="d.235.0/3">The unique feature of development consent orders is that they combine both the granting of planning permission and the making of a compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of the land. The issue that amendment 78 seeks to deal with is that under current compulsory purchase law, land acquired compulsorily&#8212;be it for this purpose or whatever&#8212;is compensated at current use value. In the majority of cases, that is likely to be agricultural value. Under certain circumstances, it might be a business value, but it is highly unlikely ever to be housing value. If the land had permission for housing, it would be dealt with by private treaty and there would not be the need to seek a compulsory purchase order anyway. What we are seeking to deal with is the anomaly that, for perhaps perfectly good reasons, an acquiring authority&#8212;it could be a public authority or it could equally be a private developer bringing forward a scheme either on their own or in partnership with a public agency&#8212;could, by getting a development consent order, acquire land from a small business at agricultural value and immediately get a significant uplift to housing value.</p>
	<p pid="d.235.0/4">Under current arrangements, there is no means for the landowner or the business person, who may have seen their holding or business disrupted, to acquire by way of compensation any of the uplift in that value that comes from the granting of housing permission. That seems to me and to many to be unfair, which is why it has been raised by the Country Land and Business Association. The amendment seeks to address that by requiring the guidance, which clause 116 already says must be put in place, to include specifically the payment of the proper land value compensation at housing value.</p>
	<p pid="d.235.0/5">It may be that the Minister will say that there are other means of dealing with that matter other than by primary legislation, but I hope he will accept that this is a real issue. In fairness to many small businesses and landowners who are affected by these important proposals, which are broadly for the public good, there should be some means of enabling them not to lose out on the uplift in value, which will, in effect, be a windfall to the acquiring authority.</p>
	<p pid="d.235.0/6">I would welcome it if the Minister looked favourably on this amendment. If he does not, I hope that he will at least be prepared to talk to those who are concerned about this matter and see whether there is some other way, short of primary legislation, to take it forward and seek to resolve it.</p>

	<p pid="d.236.0/1">I understand completely where my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11377" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24814" name="Martin Vickers">the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> are coming from, but I take a slightly different view. Let me start with finalised neighbourhood plans. I have some sympathy with their argument that there should be a community right of appeal in these circumstances, but when we looked at this in the context of the Localism Act 2015, we originally did not include it to avoid the situation where part of a community would appeal against something that the rest of the community had just voted on. I urge Ministers to look at the issue again in the context of the Bill to see whether that problem can be worked out.</p>
	<p pid="d.236.0/2">On emerging plans, I take a completely different view. First, such plans already have protection. The closer they get to finalisation, the stronger that becomes. Secondly, if communities undertaking neighbourhood plans start off at the end point rather than at the beginning, they are likely to have lots of help along the way, including at appeals.</p>

	<p pid="d.237.1/1">I will not take interventions at this late stage.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.1/2">The end point is not the inspection, but the referendum. Many communities in my own constituency have started the process of producing a neighbourhood plan and for one reason or another have abandoned it along the way, in some cases fairly close to the referendum. There is many a slip before the referendum takes place and votes are counted. To take the view that emerging plans should have a greater degree of protection would sterilise a whole area from development while that neighbourhood plan was theoretically an option. Plans have a proper place and they are being followed at appeal. There are examples of front-runners in my constituency where development has been proposed that was not in accordance with the neighbourhood plan and it was rejected at appeal.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.1/3">Neighbourhood plans share responsibility with the district or borough council for the development of the planning system for their location. It is not just a matter of protecting a village. It is a view of the development of the village for the future, and in my experience the planning inspectorate is fully prepared to back those plans as they proceed.</p>

	<p pid="d.237.2/1">This has been a worthwhile and an interesting debate. The comments of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr Blackman-Woods)</phrase> about the amendments were a bit rich, given that we had made changes and allowed extra time in Committee for her and her colleagues, and bearing in mind that we tabled the amendments back in December. Her comments on Opposition amendments repeated conversations that we had in Committee, so I do not intend to rehearse those and detain the House further on issues that we have already discussed.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/2">On Opposition new clause 57, I made it clear in Committee that we need a radical shift in the way the housing market supports young first-time buyers so that we do not condemn a whole generation to uncertainty and insecurity. That is why we want to see 200,000 new start homes built over this Parliament exclusively for young first-time buyers at a minimum of a 20% discount on open market value to help them into low cost home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/3">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11318" name="Bill Wiggin">the Member for North Herefordshire (Bill Wiggin)</phrase> for his contribution this evening. I understand the points that he made and I will take them on board and review them along with my ministerial colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24930" name="James Wharton">the Member for Stockton South (James Wharton)</phrase>, who I know will be willing to meet him and interested bodies to discuss how we can take matters forward in an appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/4">I listened carefully to the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13736" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>. He is a respected former Minister in my Department with a wealth of experience and expertise. I believe that his concerns are addressed by provisions in existing legislation, but I am very willing to meet him and interested bodies, such as the CLA, to discuss making sure that the provisions in place are adequate.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/5">I also welcome the comments from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24814" name="Martin Vickers">the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11377" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> on ensuring that communities have a strong voice in planning. My right hon. Friend focused, in particular, on infrastructure. He is quite right to draw attention to the cost of development, so I thank him for doing so. It is right that new development should be supported by an appropriate level of infrastructure and that developers should provide support to put that in place. That is what the negotiations on section 106 and the community infrastructure levy are for. We would expect any significant infrastructure that would be needed to support a proposed new development to be a material consideration for the planning decision, and therefore covered in detail in planning reports for a local authority. We would therefore expect the costs associated with putting the necessary infrastructure in place to be covered.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/6">I believe that the concerns expressed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs about neighbourhood plans are a clear indication of the strength of feeling that people have about ensuring that their voices are heard. I very much appreciate the intention of the amendment, as the Government place great importance on neighbourhood plans. However, I hope that I can convince him and other colleagues that these amendments are not necessary at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/7">Neighbourhood plans give communities the power to shape the development of their area. When a neighbourhood plan is made, it becomes part of the development plan and attains the same weight in law as a local plan, as it forms the basis for decisions on planning applications. The law is clear: decisions should be made in accordance with the development plan, with material considerations taken into account. The national planning policy framework is also very clear. It states:</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/8">&#8220;Where a planning application conflicts with a neighbourhood plan that has been brought into force, planning permission should not normally be granted.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/9">That is well understood by local planning authorities.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/10">I want to be clear that a &#8220;made&#8221; neighbourhood plan is a clear indication of a community&#8217;s vision for its local area, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/14131" name="John Howell">the Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> has outlined, and it should be respected as such. I would expect local authorities and the Planning Inspectorate to give due weight to neighbourhood plans as they progress towards adoption. The NPPF itself is</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/11">clear that the more advanced the plan, the greater the weight that may be given. Communities have their say throughout the local and neighbourhood plan-making process. Indeed, neighbourhood have the ultimate say with their referendum. Their views must be considered when decisions are taken on applications. The Bill speeds up and simplifies that neighbourhood planning process, which underlined the importance we place on it.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/12">The system is therefore already geared towards ensuring that communities&#8217; views are taken into account, and local authorities must respect that. If communities are concerned that their plans are not being respected as they should be, the Secretary of State has powers to intervene. I can confirm that the Secretary of State will continue to consider intervention to recover certain appeals where there is a made or submitted neighbourhood plan. I can further confirm that I intend shortly to lay a revised ministerial statement extending and confirming the current recovery criterion for a further six months. During that period, we will continue to review the measures. I hope that my hon. Friends who have spoken tonight and others who are interested will work with us and feed into that period.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/13">The improvements that we are proposing in the Bill will strengthen and revitalise the planning system. They are a real shot in the arm, which will get new homes built with fewer quarrels and less delay. The changes that we are making will assist those who run into difficulties, for example when negotiating section 106 agreements, giving people clarity and security that homes given planning permission will actually be built, and built in good time.</p>
	<p pid="d.237.2/14">We are continuing to set the bar as high as possible on how public land will be used. As the Prime Minister said on Monday, we will ensure that we get Britain building.</p>

	<p pid="d.257.2/1">I thank the many colleagues who have stayed so late for this debate. I hope that it conveys to the Minister the importance of this topic, although the real reason is probably that most of us do not have homes to go to. The Minister strikes me as someone who has a sumptuous home to go to, so it is in our interests not to keep him waiting too long.</p>
	<p pid="d.257.2/2">There will be people, I have no doubt, who will wonder why an English-speaking, English-sounding Conservative MP for an area of Wales that contains a patch that has been described as &#8220;little England beyond Wales&#8221; is talking about S4C at all. After all, most people&#8217;s daily intake of news and drama these days often happens online and is almost exclusively in English. People will say, &#8220;What is so special about the Welsh language these days? Shouldn&#8217;t we be equally concerned about Mandarin, French and German?&#8221;. Other cynics will say, &#8220;Hardly anybody watches this channel anyway, so what&#8217;s the big fuss about? What&#8217;s wrong with EastEnders with Welsh subtitles?&#8221;. My point is that those people miss the point.</p>
	<p pid="d.257.2/3">Half of my constituency&#8212;the South Pembrokeshire part&#8212;is principally and historically English speaking, but the people are as passionately Welsh as the people in any other part of the country. The village names give a bit of a clue: Manorbier, St Florence, Lamphey. They do not sound particularly Welsh because they are of Flemish origin, but goodness me, those places are as patriotic and supportive of the Welsh nation when it comes to sport or culture as anywhere else. The other half of the constituency&#8212;the Carmarthenshire bit&#8212;has a more obvious visible and historical connection to the Welsh language. One can travel through places such as Llanboidy, Trelech and Talog. There is a much more visible air of the Welsh language about those places.</p>
	<p pid="d.257.2/4">It is because of that contrast that I feel modestly qualified to comment on this matter, even if the only three words of Welsh that I know and use regularly are &#8220;gwin coch mawr&#8221;. To share the secret with you, Mr Speaker, and the Minister, those words mean &#8220;large red wine&#8221;. In my 13 years of living and working in Wales, that phrase has got me into and out of most of the situations in which I have found myself. I therefore come at this topic from a modest but enthusiastic position.</p>

	<p pid="d.257.4/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point that I will come to later. Every pound that is invested in the creative arts by S4C produces &#163;2 for the wider economy, so it makes a valuable contribution.</p>
	<p pid="d.257.4/2">I like to think that I understand a little about the importance of culture in our part of the United Kingdom.

We must consider the broader remit of S4C in supporting the language among young people and children and helping to grow the language. My background is not particularly different from his, but I am proud that my children all speak Welsh. They do so partly because of an excellent education system, but also because of S4C.</p>

In some respects it is disappointing that when we mention S4C to colleagues, the most we get is a nod and a reference to &#8220;Pobol y Cwm&#8221; or something like that. After that people&#8217;s knowledge of the channel largely dries up. S4C is the only Welsh language channel in the world and, as I said, it is more than just a TV station.</p>

	<p pid="d.259.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me to associate myself with his excellent speech, and through my past interventions and questions the Minister will know how much I agree with every point being made. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Welsh language, and S4C&#8217;s link to it, is what makes Wales distinctive? It should not be just seen as a Welsh cultural icon; it should be seen as a British cultural icon, and that is massively important.</p>

	<p pid="d.259.1/1">As ever, my hon. Friend puts his finger right on it.</p>
	<p pid="d.259.1/2">Between 1901 and 1981 the number of Welsh speakers reduced from 900,000 to 500,000, but the fact that that number has stabilised and is going back up in certain areas is largely thanks to the work of S4C, and others, in stabilising and broadcasting to around 700,000 people. The channel was the birth child of the Thatcher Government&#8212;not a lot of people know that either, and I hope I will not offend my nationalist friends by saying, before they claim ownership of the channel, that that Government were proud to be associated with it. It is the fifth oldest TV channel and was first broadcast back in November 1982. It launched the careers of Bryn Terfel, Rhys Ifans and Matthew Rees, and exported the hit show, &#8220;Hinterland&#8221; to more than 30 countries. It is the second biggest investor in children&#8217;s programmes in the UK&#8212;a point raised a few minutes ago&#8212;and all on a budget of around &#163;85 million and 150 full-time staff. That is a small proportion of the 18,974 people currently employed by the BBC. Every pound invested by S4C in the creative industries is worth more than &#163;2 to the wider economy&#8212;that reinforces a point made earlier.</p>

	<p pid="d.260.1/1">The hon. Gentleman, and my neighbour, is right to raise that point. S4C has been emphatic that whatever the funding settlement, it will not have an impact on their relocation plans. Inevitably, however, there is bound to be a consequence of some sort, but the move from Cardiff to Carmarthen is not in jeopardy and is going ahead on time and as planned.</p>
	<p pid="d.260.1/2">Moving on to the budget element, we are all guilty in this House of approving of other people&#8217;s budgets being cut and other people&#8217;s Departments being slimmed down while putting up a robust case for why our particular areas of interest should somehow be exempt or shown special treatment. This is not the case with S4C. It has made significant inroads already as far as its overheads are concerned, with a reduction of 36% since 2010 compared with 20% at the BBC. Let us not forget that 90% of its money comes from the licence fee, while the rest comes direct from a contribution by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid="d.260.1/3">I conclude, as we always do in these kinds of debates, with a list of simple observations and questions for the Minister. First, I can find no argument not to defer cuts pending an independent review of the specific and unique role of the channel. The review should include the impact of the channel on the society, culture and economy of Wales.</p>

The cultural importance of the channel to Wales cannot be overstated. I just wanted to say that, as the channel moves from Cardiff to Carmarthen.</p>

	<p pid="d.261.0/1">Just to reiterate my hon. Friend&#8217;s point on funding, does he consider it fair that in the recent comprehensive spending review DCMS bodies across the board saw reductions of some 5%, whereas S4C saw a reduction of some 24%?</p>

	<p pid="d.261.1/1">To me, that is slightly mystifying. The DCMS announcement, as contained in the autumn statement, seems to default on the manifesto commitment. We have talked about a reduction from &#163;6.7 million to &#163;5 million. Those figures might not sound enormous in the general scheme of things, but the reduction does send a rather negative message to the BBC, which is yet to determine on its own contribution to the channel.</p>

	<p pid="d.261.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way on that specific point. In view of the fact that there was a clear manifesto commitment from the Welsh Conservative party, the message we are sending to the other main funder of the channel is very negative. The negotiations between S4C and the BBC are crucial to the future of the channel. If the cut by DCMS, which is well above the cuts by the Department to other arts institutions in England, is permitted, the message to the BBC is extremely negative and very regrettable in view of the promises made to the people of Wales.</p>

Bizarrely, the provision for Persian, Russian, Arabic and Korean is now enhanced, yet the money spent on our native language in Wales seems to be under threat. I hope the Minister will explain the logic behind that conclusion. A manifesto promise is exactly that&#8212;a promise&#8212;and we would need to come up with a pretty good reason why it was no longer a promise. To retain the Government&#8217;s credibility in Wales, we have to do more than just say nice things about culture and language; we have to do good things, mean what we say, deliver on our promises and make sure that people know we will deliver on our manifesto commitments, not default on them a few weeks later.</p>

	<p pid="d.262.0/2">Not that many weeks ago, the Chancellor managed to magic up about 4 billion quid in remarkable circumstances in the weeks and days before the autumn statement. We are talking about a tiny fraction of that. All we seek from the Minister is the funding protection promised in our manifesto and a commitment to keeping the promise we made.

	<p pid="d.262.5/1">It is worth considering the funding issue facing S4C. When we made the change after entering government, the overall funding for S4C did not fall significantly, but a lot of the funding was transferred to the BBC. I remember having extensive discussions then with Welsh Members, obviously with the S4C management and with Members of the other House who had held senior positions in previous Governments.</p>
	<p pid="d.262.5/2">Unless my maths is askew&#8212;it might well be; I claim no great credit for it&#8212;the overall funding was at around &#163;100 million for S4C then, and it is in the region of &#163;80 million now. It is worth reminding the House of how that funding works. S4C gets roughly &#163;6.8 million directly from DCMS, but gets something like &#163;74 million from the BBC. It is important to stress that that funding is still independent: the BBC has no say in how the money is spent by S4C. It is also worth remembering that the BBC has an obligation to provide S4C with some 10 hours of free programming every week, which in equivalent cash terms amounts to something like &#163;20 million. We are talking about an organisation that receives about &#163;100 million in total in annual funding.</p>
	<p pid="d.262.5/3">The cuts that we are talking about, although headlined as being 25%, amount to just &#163;1.5 million within that overall budget. It is an overall cut of less than 2%. Although I understand the strong feelings about S4C&#8212;I share them, as I have worked to preserve its future for the last five years, continuing the good work carried out by previous Conservative Governments&#8212;to characterise this as somehow a devastating cut is quite wrong. Having said that, it is certainly the case that we will continue to listen to all hon. Members on this important issue.</p>

Member for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen)</phrase>, who is a great advocate for his constituency, particularly on the issue of broadband, about which we have had many discussions. It does not surprise me that he makes pertinent points about S4C. On those points, we will continue to listen to hon. Members about the funding, as I said. It is incredibly important to hear the arguments put both by my hon. Friends and Opposition Members. Secondly, we are sympathetic to the point about having an independent review of S4C and Welsh language broadcasting. That is certainly something that we will look at with the utmost seriousness. Thirdly, we have heard about the contribution of S4C to Welsh culture and Wales in general&#8212;again, a view that we strongly share.</p>
	<p pid="d.263.1/2">In calling this important debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire argued effectively about S4C&#8217;s contributions to Wales. Let us start with the Welsh economy, for example, and its support for independent production. We should also note the international recognition that S4C has brought to Welsh broadcasting. I hope hon. Members will not regard me as facetious if I praise the fact that a Welsh hill farmer is now presenting a French television programme. Members might be interested to know that Gareth Wyn Jones, a farmer from Conwy, stars in &#8220;The Hill Farm&#8221;, which incidentally won a BAFTA award, as a result of which he was asked to front a travel show on Wales for a major French television channel.</p>

Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart)</phrase> hit this issue on the head in his comments to the press today when he said that this was a clear election promise broken. The Conservative party promised to protect the funding of S4C. With broken promises on rail electrification in Swansea to be taken into account and with an election coming up in May for the National Assembly, why should anyone take seriously anything that the Conservative party says?</p>

	<p pid="d.264.3/1">It is important to remind Members of an earlier intervention by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11506" name="David Jones">the Member for Clwyd West (Mr Jones)</phrase> about comparing the reduction in funding for S4C from the DCMS grant with the reduction in funding in other parts of the DCMS portfolio. It is worth remembering that the funding for S4C was safeguarded two years ago. We worked very hard to safeguard and protect that funding at a time when we were having to make quite deep cuts to other national organisations. It has always been our intention&#8212;we said it in the manifesto&#8212;to safeguard S4C&#8217;s funding. I would argue that that is what we have done. Nevertheless, as I have said time and again, we will listen to hon. Members on both sides of the House when they make their representations in this important debate and in other forums. We will listen to them on the issue of funding and the impact that may have. We will listen to them as well on the point about whether there should be an independent review. However, I want to continue to emphasise how much I am enjoying the contributions by Members in all these debates, which is why I want to take another intervention.</p>

	<p pid="d.264.5/1">As I have said, despite my hon. Friend&#8217;s being, I think, the first Conservative representative for Gower ever, on which I congratulate him, I am not going to be tempted to make Government policy this early in the morning. We have always said that we will look at S4C as part of the charter review, but I have also made it clear that we are very sympathetic to calls for a more wide-ranging independent review as well because we want to continue to safeguard S4C and to see its success. We want to see, for example, programmes such as &#8220;Fferm Ffactor&#8221;, which is licensed and produced in Denmark, Sweden and the China hinterland.</p>
	<p pid="d.264.5/2">My hon. Friend who secured this important debate does not need to remind me that S4C is the second biggest investor in the UK in children&#8217;s programming, because my two children grew up with Fireman Sam and I am well aware of S4C&#8217;s great expertise in this area. It sells successful formats overseas and we have all enjoyed &#8220;Hinterland&#8221;. Some of us enjoyed the English-language version; others have enjoyed the Welsh-language version. It cannot be a coincidence that, thanks to S4C&#8217;s success, we now see in Wales 50 television and animation companies generating around &#163;1 billion for the Welsh economy. S4C alone contributed &#163;117 million to the Welsh economy. In Wales, 50,000 people are employed in the creative industries, a 10% increase since 2011, and 80,000 in the wider creative economy.</p>

I prefer to think that this is not a bedtime story but an early morning wake-up call to all of us who care about S4C and want to preserve its future. It serves a base of Welsh-language speakers, which, according to the last census, is forecast to grow, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said, by more than half a million people. It is also important to note that, although S4C&#8217;s viewing figures have gone down in</p>

	<p pid="d.266.2/1">Does the Minister agree that the means by which we measure the viewing figures for S4C are not appropriate? It involves 300 television sets across Wales, 173 in Welsh-speaking homes. Children under four are not included in the figures, nor are people who watch on digital platforms. It really is not fit and that is writ large in the case of the small viewing figures for S4C.</p>
