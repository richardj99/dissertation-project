	<p pid="e.111.5/1">Legal aid is a fundamental part of our justice system, but resources are not limitless. When reform began, we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, at about &#163;2 billion a year. Even after our reforms are complete, our legal aid system will still be one of the most generous, at about &#163;1.5 billion a year. The Transforming Legal Aid programme that is currently being implemented is designed to save an extra &#163;215 million per year. There are no current plans for further changes to funding levels beyond this programme, but the financial pressure to balance the books remains.</p>

	<p pid="e.111.6/1">Research by Rights of Women has revealed that six out of 10 women who suffered domestic violence and were then refused legal aid took no further action through the courts, and many, as a result, ended up staying in violent and abusive relationships. Will the Lord Chancellor look again at the barriers to access to justice that his legislation has created?</p>

	<p pid="e.111.7/1">There are two issues involved. Clearly, domestic violence is a criminal offence and it should be dealt with properly by the police. Although we made a number of difficult changes in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, one of the groups we protected was women who needed to go to court after an incident of domestic violence, and that is the way it should be.</p>

	<p pid="e.111.9/1">Not surprisingly, the Bar Council has argued very strongly for the status quo on legal aid. We have worked with it closely over the past 12 months, particularly in the work done by Sir Bill Jeffrey and, most recently, Lord Justice Leveson on how we can improve the process to reduce work load, at a time when we face big financial pressures, and create a system that is more efficient.</p>

	<p pid="e.112.1/1">As a Government, we have had to take some difficult decisions about legal aid. It is certainly the case that there is less legal aid money available for family law cases than there was. I am afraid that is a natural consequence of the financial challenges that we have faced. It is interesting that no party in this House has pledged to reverse these changes.</p>

	<p pid="e.112.3/1">So far, there has been an increase in the number of litigants in person. Of course, we have always had litigants in person in our courts. We continue to monitor the situation closely. The Minister of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, is working hard to look at additional ways of smoothing the processes that people have available to represent themselves.

Will he join the shadow Lord Chancellor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40610" name="Sadiq Khan">the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan)</phrase>, in burying it? Will he work with the legal profession to devise a model that does not put hundreds of high street solicitors&#8217; firms out of business and lead to more miscarriages of justice? Or is this just like prisons, probation and the Courts Service&#8212;another of the policy car crashes he is leaving to an incoming Labour Government to sort out?</p>

	<p pid="e.112.5/1">The one thing we can always guarantee at these sessions is to hear a load of nonsense from the hon. Gentleman. I have listened carefully to Labour Members&#8217; arguments over the past few months. They oppose when it is politically convenient to do so, but they have absolutely no idea what they would do in our place&#8212;and that is why the electorate are not going to give them the chance.</p>

	<p pid="e.113.1/1">The evidence backs up what the hon. Gentleman says: only 32% of adults said they were in paid employment in the four weeks prior to custody, so the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question is along the right lines. The evidence also tells us that more than a third of young people who go to prison in Nottingham reoffend. That is why we are putting education and skills at the heart of our transforming youth custody programme. The Government have also given &#163;100,000 from the local enterprise partnership to the project in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituency.</p>

	<p pid="e.114.5/1">There are three specific issues on the table. The first is what we did in December, which allows for new, tough financial penalties on companies&#8212;by which I mean companies as a whole&#8212;that break the rules. The second is the proposal that we have consulted on and are about to respond to, which would lower the threshold at which enforcement action can be taken and produce a fine of up to &#163;500,000, which should be a deterrent. The issue of holding individual company members to account is more complex and will not be the first of the two things we do.</p>

We are taking additional measures to try to tackle that, including tougher security measures and tougher penalties within prisons, and the training of dogs to sniff out that new generation of substances.</p>
	<p pid="e.118.1/2">Of course, alongside that, proper work must be done to try to tackle addiction. With the through-the-gate system we have created and are creating, it is important that we see a flow-through from work done in our prisons to work done after our prisons. I remember being told by prison staff how frustrated they were that they had no guarantee that the rehab being done in prisons would continue when prisoners left. That will now change.</p>

We have taken a series of measures, announced only a couple of days ago by the Secretary of State, to give governors more powers to crack down on the problem. We are trying to educate families and friends of prisoners not to smuggle these substances into prisons. If we can reduce the amount of those drugs in prisons, we will reduce levels of violence.

The Minister will try to talk about the new directives for victims, but why have the Government been silent about the rights of the British taxpayer, Tyrell Matthews-Burton, and yet have spoken up for others?</p>

We have taken steps over the past year to increase the use of mediation in the family courts, which has been successful. That should be applied to other disputes, including over property boundaries, and experts should also be used, but whether it is right to go down a mandatory route is the difficult question. I will work with my hon. Friend to see if we can reach agreement on how to move forward.</p>

This will reduce reoffending, which has been much too high for much too long. On <phrase class="date" code="2015-02-01">1 February</phrase>, we brought into force the remaining uncommenced provisions of the Offender Rehabilitation Act 2014. This means that, for the first time, virtually all offenders will be given a proper chance of rehabilitation. The Act extends statutory supervision and support to the 45,000 offenders a year who are released from prison sentences of less than 12 months, the majority of whom currently receive no support at all after their custodial sentence ends. They simply walk the streets with a few pounds in their pockets. This group of offenders has the highest reoffending rate of almost any group; almost 60% of those released from short prison sentences went on to reoffend within 12 months. The changes mean that any offender whose offence was committed on or after <phrase class="date" code="2015-02-01">1 February</phrase> and who has been sentenced to a custodial term of more than one day will now receive at least 12 months&#8217; supervision after release.

The Opposition cannot have it both ways: either the Bill does something, in which case they should ignore it, or it does not do something, in which case they might have a point. The reality is that the Bill makes a real difference: it will protect volunteers and small employers against spurious claims in the workplace.

	<p pid="e.135.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order relates to question 16 on today&#8217;s Order Paper and implies no criticism at all of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell)</phrase>. The question refers to prisoners who have &#8220;committed&#8221; suicide. Prisoners no longer commit suicide; nor does anyone else since the Suicide Act 1961. The word &#8220;commit&#8221; suggests a criminal offence and is a pejorative term that offends many of those who have lost family and friends to suicide. The Table Office could be instructed to be vigilant about the use of such terms. Perhaps the appropriate term could have been &#8220;died by their own hand&#8221; or &#8220;took their own life&#8221;, but the question certainly should not have used the word &#8220;commit&#8221;, which relates to a criminal offence.</p>

	<p pid="e.135.5/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I seek your guidance in uncharted territory. We have not had a fixed-term Parliament before and visits to constituencies by Ministers become much more sensitive in this clear run-up to an election. I heard at 5.38 pm last Thursday that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions would visit Kirklees college in the heart of my constituency at 11 am the next day. If that was an official visit, it would have been a courtesy to have told me that he was coming so that I could perhaps have been there to welcome him. I understand that Colne Valley and Dewsbury are highly sensitive marginal seats nearby, but this was an official visit, presumably paid for by the taxpayer, in the run-up to an election that we know will be on <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-07">7 May</phrase>. What is the status of such visits and should there not be the usual courtesy of telling a Member when a Minister is visiting their patch?</p>

	<p pid="e.135.6/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. He asks what is the status of such an arrangement. The short answer is that it is a convention;</p>
	<p pid="e.135.6/2">it is not a requirement of parliamentary procedure or of our Standing Orders. That said, I think it is very much to be preferred that the convention should be observed, as it is for the most part by Members on both sides of the House. Notification, by definition, must take place before the visit, but in order to comply with the spirit of the convention, it seems to me reasonable that Members should have adequate notice of, in particular, official visits, so that if they wish to be present, they have the chance to be so. I do not in any way diminish the significance of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point or of what I just said when I note that the honouring of that arrangement has frequently been as much in the breach as in the observance, and that, I think, is regrettable. It is not a point applied to one side rather than the other.</p>
	<p pid="e.135.6/3">I know that in the past, long before I was elected to the Chair, visits were made to institutions within my own constituency of which I did not have what I regarded as anything like adequate notice in order to be able to decide whether I wished to be present. I appeal to colleagues to be considerate and solicitous in these matters, because a colleague who does not observe the convention is not only doing the wrong thing, but wholly disabling himself or herself from subsequently complaining if the convention is not honoured when his or her own constituency is affected. I think that deals with the matter.</p>

	<p pid="e.136.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. When the Justice Committee, as was mentioned earlier, held an appointment hearing for the chief inspector of probation, some information was not given to it, although the Cabinet guidelines did not require that to be done. Subsequently, the position changed quite significantly when the wife of Paul McDowell was promoted to a much more senior post in an organisation which had in the meantime obtained contracts for probation. I think it right to say by way of a point of order not only that in my view has Mr McDowell correctly resigned, but that I endorse what the Lord Chancellor has said about his integrity, I repeat what the Committee said about his suitability for the job and his abilities, and I dissociate myself from any attack on his integrity from any part of the House today.</p>

	<p pid="e.138.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require listed companies to report annually on the percentage of their staff paid below a Living Wage; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/3">I am introducing the Bill because we need to be more open about the problem of low pay in our economy. Many of the UK&#8217;s largest, most well known companies pay wages which people cannot afford to live on. Millions of shop workers, care assistants, cleaners and catering staff are paid so little that the only way they can make ends meet is with the help of tax credits and the payment of in-work benefits. Put simply, the state is supplementing the incomes of the low-paid while subsidising the wage bill of their employers. I believe that companies that can afford to pay the living wage have a responsibility to do so, and we should have a right to know when they do not pay it. Greater transparency is needed to raise public awareness of the problem and to encourage big companies to do the right thing.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/4">We are approaching the end of the first Parliament since the 1920s in which people will be worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. This is a country where 4.9 million workers earn less than the living wage&#8212;the income necessary to achieve a minimum acceptable standard of living. That is one in five British workers who do not earn a fair day&#8217;s pay for a fair day&#8217;s work. The living wage is not just about having enough money to eat and pay the rent and the bills; it gives workers the means to live a dignified and decent life. For many of my constituents, the living wage means everything from being able to afford a family holiday now and again to peace of mind at the end of the month. It means being able to get home in time to see their children because they are not struggling to hold down two jobs. These are not unreasonable expectations, but they are being denied to far too many people by poverty-level pay.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/5">In May 2010, the Prime Minister declared that the living wage was</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/6">&#8220;an idea whose time has come&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/7">Sadly, under his Government, we are still waiting. In the past five years, the number of people earning less than the living wage has soared by an additional 1.4 million. The majority of working-age households living below the poverty line now have at least one adult in work. In my constituency, there are over 10,000 people whose hard work is rewarded with a pay packet which does not give them enough to live a decent life. The recovery may have reached some in the City of London, but for those struggling on low pay in Lewisham, it has yet to materialise.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/8">Every fortnight at my advice surgery I meet people who simply cannot afford to live off their earnings. They are often employed by some of our country&#8217;s biggest companies&#8212;the large supermarkets, for example. These are people who are doing the right thing&#8212;working hard and contributing&#8212;but they are not earning enough to pay the bills. I have been shown payslips where take-home wages are less than &#163;1,000 a month, and I am asked what people are meant to live off when they</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/9">have to pay &#163;700 a month in rent. At the same time, their employers may make hundreds of millions of pounds a year in profit, much of which will go straight into the pockets of their shareholders.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/10">The irony is that this is not just bad for our country&#8217;s living standards; it is bad for the Treasury too. This Government&#8217;s failure to meet their own deficit reduction targets has proved that low pay is a drain on our public finances. The wages of under-paid staff routinely have to be topped up by Government through the payment of tax credits and in-work benefits. In the circumstances, this support for the low paid is the correct approach, but it means that at the end of the day it is the taxpayer who is subsidising the wages bill of large private companies. Low pay is driving up the benefits bill and making it harder to get the deficit down.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/11">The truth is that low pay stifles our economy, stunts taxes coming into the Treasury and ends up in more Government borrowing, which we can ill afford. That may be an economic plan of sorts, but it does not sound to me like one that is working. So something needs to change. In the UK, the living wage stands at &#163;7.85 an hour, and the London figure is &#163;9.15. I see no reason why big companies making significant profits should not pay it. If they choose not to do so, why should they not have to be up-front about that decision, and tell us?</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/12">This Bill would not compel anyone to pay a living wage. What it would do is give the public and workers a mechanism by which they can find out who pays it and who does not. Listed companies are already required to produce annual remuneration reports, but these focus on directors&#8217; pay. The Bill would provide some balance&#8212;a focus on the bottom as well as the top. The data required to comply with the Bill could be generated relatively simply by the companies in question, but their impact would be significant: they would end the silence on poverty pay that allows many of our biggest companies to inflate their profit margins at the expense of their staff and of every taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/13">I have heard it said that low pay can in some ways be good for business. I guess the argument goes that increased profits should mean more money ploughed back into enterprise, meaning more economic growth. There are many assumptions in such an argument, and I am not so sure that it always stacks up. Low pay may sometimes mean higher short-term profits, but it can also mean demoralised staff who are preoccupied with their daily struggle to try to make work pay.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/14">Paying workers a wage that supports a decent standard of living is not just the responsible thing to do; the research shows that there are also clear business benefits. Low pay has high costs, in reduced productivity, higher absenteeism and lower staff retention. It is for those reasons that over 1,000 companies have now signed up to be accredited living wage employers, from the energy company SSE to Chelsea football club.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/15">Many public sector bodies are also leading the way. I was proud to be a member of Lewisham council when we became the first local authority to become a living wage employer, and I commend the determination of</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/16">Lewisham&#8217;s mayor, Sir Steve Bullock, to roll out the living wage to even more contracted staff, despite a very tough financial outlook. I also commend you, Mr Speaker, for your efforts to make this House an accredited living wage employer.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/17">Big and small employers alike now pay a living wage. The south London-based Jane Jefferson Cleaning, whose tagline is &#8220;The Only Way is Ethics&#8221;, is the only domestic cleaning company to be recognised by the Living Wage Foundation. If a small cleaning company can pay the living wage, why can firms that have multi-million pound salaries at the top not pay it at the bottom? A director in a FTSE 100 company now earns, on average, 130 times more than their average employee, and 300 times more than the living wage, yet only 18 of those 100 companies pay the living wage. The Government&#8217;s policy of &#8220;wait and see&#8221; on low pay has clearly failed. Legislating for greater transparency would celebrate the best employers and expose injustice to public pressure.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/18">Britain cannot continue on its current path. The Government have failed to create the decent jobs and decent wages that we need for the next generation. Instead, they have preferred a silent race to the bottom, masked by loud trumpeting of falls in unemployment without a care for the nature and pay conditions of the jobs created. The next Labour Government will make the problem of low pay a national priority. We will increase the minimum wage to &#163;8 an hour and give a tax break to companies that sign up to become living wage employers in the first year of the next Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/19">Decent pay requires the British economy to generate better jobs, with improvements in skills and support for investment in cutting-edge industries, but it also needs more honesty about the sources of low pay, putting pressure on large companies to meet their responsibilities to their workers and the taxpayer as well as to their shareholders.</p>
	<p pid="e.138.2/20">In conclusion, it might be entirely legal for large companies not to pay their staff a living wage, but that does not make it right. The Bill is not about forcing our largest employers to pay a wage above the statutory minimum; it is about encouraging them to make the right choices about the pay of the people they rely on. This simple Bill would introduce a simple reporting requirement. It would allow the public to recognise those companies that go above and beyond their legal obligations, enabling the consumer to identify those businesses that want to build a fairer economy as well as a stronger one. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.141.10/1">As I explained to the Second Reading Committee, part 2 concerns the duty on prospective policyholders to disclose information to the insurer, which allows the insurer to assess and price the risk accurately. However, the existing law can be difficult to understand and even more difficult to comply with fully. A failure to provide all material information allows the insurer to refuse all claims under the contract.</p>
	<p pid="e.141.10/2">Under the Bill, policyholders still have a duty to disclose information, and they should make an active search for relevant information, but insurers might need to ask the policyholder questions if they require further clarification. If a policyholder fails to make a fair presentation of the risk, there is a new system of proportionate remedies for the insurer, under schedule 1 to the Bill, based on what the insurer would have done had the failure not occurred.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-02-03e.142.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="142"  time="012:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150203/debtext/150203-0001.htm#150203-0001.htm_spnew133">
	<p pid="e.142.0/1">There is nothing particularly controversial in clause 2, or indeed in clauses 3 to 8 and schedule 1. As the Minister said, the clause provides that the duty of fair presentation, which is set out in the remainder of the part, applies in the event of a variation to a non-consumer insurance contract as well as upon the initial agreement or the contract.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/2">Clause 3 introduces a requirement on the insured to</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/3">&#8220;make to the insurer a fair presentation of the risk&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/4">before the contract is entered into. That replaces existing duties in relation to disclosure and representations contained in the Marine Insurance Act 1906, but retains essential elements of those provisions in ensuring that the insured provides insurers with the information they require to decide whether to insure a risk and on what terms.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/5">Clause 4 relates to an issue that we debated last week in Committee. The clause defines what the insured knows, and ought to know, for the purposes of the duty of disclosure in clause 3, based on the insured&#8217;s duty in section 18 of the 1906 Act to disclose every material circumstance known to them, including everything which,</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/6">&#8220;in the ordinary course of business&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/7">ought to be known to them. There was some difference of opinion about the scope and applicability of the Bill&#8217;s phraseology, particularly the definition of &#8220;senior management&#8221; as</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/8">&#8220;those&#8230;who play significant roles in the making of decisions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/9">We debated whether that definition was perhaps too narrow. Helpfully, the Minister told us that the Government had</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/10">&#8220;amended the explanatory notes to make it clear that the senior management is likely to include the board, but can also go beyond it, depending on the corporate structure of the relevant policyholder.&#8221;&#8212;[<i>Official Report, Second Reading Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2015-01-26">26 January 2015</phrase>; c. 8.]</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/11">She also gave us information about stakeholders who have commented on this and agree that the Bill&#8217;s drafting is appropriate. I welcome the move by the Government to tighten up the explanatory notes to deal with that question.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/12">Clause 5 deals with the knowledge of the insurer. Clause 6 provides that what an individual knows includes not only what they actually know but &#8220;blind-eye&#8221; knowledge&#8212;that is, knowledge that they ought to have but have deliberately neglected to acquire. Clause 7 serves to ensure that a company or other principal is not fixed with knowledge of a fraud practised against it by its agent or office. Clause 8 provides the insurer with remedies if there is a breach of the duty of fair representation. Schedule 1 sets out the insurer&#8217;s remedies for &#8220;qualifying breaches&#8221; under this clause.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.0/13">Given the assurances that we received and the changes that were made when we raised these points in Committee, I have no difficulty with these clauses.</p>

	<p pid="e.143.1/1">Part 3 deals with insurance warranties and similar terms. An insurance warranty is typically a promise by the policyholder to do something that mitigates the risk. Under the current law, any breach of warranty completely discharges the insurer from liability from the point of breach. That is so even if the breach is remedied before any loss is suffered and if the breached term had nothing to do with the loss. The insurer&#8217;s remedy therefore often seems unsuitable and overly punitive. The Bill provides that an insurer will be liable for insured losses arising after a breach of warranty has been remedied. It also prevents an insurer from refusing payment on the basis of a breached term that could have had no bearing on the risk of the loss that actually occurred, such as where a warranty concerning a fire alarm is breached and the insured then suffers a flood in the insured property. The Bill also abolishes &#8220;basis of the contract&#8221; clauses. These clauses convert every statement made by a policyholder on a proposal form into a warranty.</p>

	<p pid="e.143.2/1">Again, it has been helpful to hear the Minister&#8217;s comments. We have no difficulty with these clauses.</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/2">On clause 9, under the current law, an insurer may add a declaration to a non- consumer insurance proposal form or policy, stating that the insured warrants the accuracy of all the answers given or that such answers form the &#8220;basis of the contract&#8221;. That has the legal effect of converting representations into warranties. The insurer is discharged from liability for claims if the insured made any misrepresentation, even if it was immaterial and did not induce the insurer to enter into the contract. The Law Commission gave the example of a claim for flooding being refused, as the Minister suggested, because the insured had failed to install the right model of burglar alarm. The clause seeks to put an end to this practice by abolishing &#8220;basis of the contract&#8221; clauses in non-consumer insurance. Clause 10 replaces the existing remedy for breach of a warranty in an insurance contract.</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/3">Clause 11 was initially not included in the Bill. That gave rise to the introduction in the other place of a new clause that replicated a similar clause originally included by the Law Commission pertaining to situations in which an insured had breached a term of contract but could show that</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/4">&#8220;its breach of the term could not have increased the risk of the loss which actually occurred in the circumstances in which it occurred.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/5">In the Lords Committee, some expressed the view that this omission was an error. The Minister, Lord Newby, explained that the clause as originally drafted was</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/6">&#8220;too controversial to go through the special procedure for uncontroversial Law Commission Bills.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/7">He did, however, admit that it was</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/8">&#8220;difficult to argue against the policy and to say that insurers should be entitled to refuse liability for a loss that is of a completely different nature from that contemplated by the breached term.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/9">At the Government&#8217;s prompting, the Law Commission submitted a new draft, which became the current clause 11 and which was</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/10">&#8220;intended to minimise the uncertainty inherent in the first formulation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.143.2/11">The clause acts to rectify the situation prior to the Bill when the actual nature of a breach of term was irrelevant. This has been a helpful process to ensure that that piece of tidying up was done. On that basis, we have no problem with these clauses.</p>

	<p pid="e.144.3/1">Fraud is a serious and expensive problem for insurers and innocent policyholders alike. According to industry statistics, policyholders currently pay an additional &#163;50 on every insurance policy because of the cost of fraud on insurers. The Bill therefore strengthens and clarifies the civil law aspect of the Government&#8217;s drive to combat fraudulent claims by policyholders. The Bill sets out clear statutory remedies for the insurer where the policyholder has made a fraudulent claim. It affirms the common law position that the policyholder forfeits the fraudulent claim. The insurer has no liability to pay any element of it and can reclaim anything it paid before it knew about the fraud.</p>
	<p pid="e.144.3/2">The Bill also clarifies an area of uncertainty, in that the insurer may choose to refuse any claim arising after the fraudulent act. However, previous valid claims should be paid in full. Finally, the Bill gives the insurer the equivalent remedies against a fraudulent member of a group insurance policy.</p>

	<p pid="e.144.4/1">The Minister has again clearly outlined what the clauses do. As she said, clause 12 sets out the insurer&#8217;s remedies where the insured makes a fraudulent claim. It puts the common law rule of forfeiture on a statutory footing. Where the insured commits a fraud against the insurer, the insurer is not liable to pay the insurance claim to which the fraud relates. Where the insurer has already paid out insurance moneys on the claim and later discovers the fraud, the insurer may recover those moneys from the insured. As we have heard, that provides the insurer with a further remedy giving it an option to treat the contract as if it had been terminated at the time of the &#8220;fraudulent act&#8221;. That does not apply where a third party commits a fraud against the insurer or the insured, such as where a fraudulent claim is made against an insured who seeks recovery from its insurer under a liability policy.</p>
	<p pid="e.144.4/2">Clause 13 gives the insurer the remedies where there is fraud by one member of a group scheme. Again, we have no difficulty with these clauses standing part of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="e.144.4/3" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

	<p pid="e.145.3/1">Part 5 deals with two separate matters: the principle of good faith and the ability of parties to contract out of the provisions of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="e.145.3/2">Clause 14 retains the statutory and common law principle that a contract of insurance is one predicated on good faith. However, the clause abolishes avoidance of the contract as the remedy for breach, recognising that avoidance is capable of operating very harshly against policyholders.</p>
	<p pid="e.145.3/3">The provisions are a default regime for business insurance contracts. They are expected to be appropriate for the majority of insurance contracts, but there may be circumstances when parties prefer to set out their own bespoke arrangements. However, if an insurer wishes to rely on a term that will operate more harshly against the policyholder than the Bill otherwise provides, clauses 16 and 17 require it to act transparently when the contract is made, by ensuring that the meaning of the alternative provision is clear, and by drawing the attention of the policyholder to it. In so far as the Bill applies to consumers rather than businesses, it is a mandatory regime. Insurers are not entitled to contract out of its provisions to the detriment of consumers.</p>

	<p pid="e.145.4/1">Under the Marine Insurance Act 1906, insurance contracts are ones of &#8220;utmost good faith&#8221;. Clause 14 removes avoidance of the contract as a remedy for breach of that duty of good faith, both from the 1906 Act and at common law. The intention of clause 14 is that good faith will remain an interpretative principle, with section 17 of the 1906 Act and the common law continuing to provide that insurance contracts are contracts of good faith.</p>
	<p pid="e.145.4/2">Clauses 15 and 16 prohibit insurers from inserting in an insurance contract, terms that would leave the insured&#8212;be they a consumer or a non-consumer&#8212;in a worse position than that required by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="e.145.4/3">Clause 16 defines transparency in respect of what an insurer must do to draw the insured&#8217;s attention to the disadvantageous terms of the contract. Clause 17 sets out the transparency requirements. For example, the insurer should take sufficient steps to draw disadvantageous terms to the insured&#8217;s attention within a reasonable time frame prior to their entering into the contract, but when an insured has knowledge of the term, they may not claim that the insurer has not brought it to their attention. Clause 18 deals with the insurer&#8217;s remedies where a member of a group insurance contract makes a fraudulent claim. Again, we do not think that these clauses are controversial and we are content for them to stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="e.146.3/1">Part 6 covers a topic that is distinct from insurance contract law. It amends the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010 and will assist injured parties who have claims against parties that are now defunct where insurance was in place to cover such claims. As I said in the Second Reading Committee, part 6 will make it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to obtain compensation due from insolvent employers.</p>
	<p pid="e.146.3/2">The Bill allows the Secretary of State, by regulations, to add or remove circumstances in which a person will fall within the provisions of the 2010 Act. The intention in the first instance is to use this power to add insolvency and other similar events to the 2010 Act. Draft regulations are being prepared by the Ministry of Justice. Once the first set of regulations are made, the 2010 Act can be commenced. The Government are committed to bringing the 2010 Act into force as soon as practicable.</p>

	<p pid="e.146.4/1">In the Second Reading Committee, I welcomed the fact that part 6 gives mesothelioma sufferers the opportunity to be dealt with in a timely fashion and to receive the justice they deserve. It is a terrible condition that many people have suffered as a work-related illness. We should do everything possible to support them.</p>
	<p pid="e.146.4/2">Clause 19 inserts a new section into the 2010 Act. It enables the Secretary of State to make regulations adding or removing circumstances in which a person is a &#8220;relevant person&#8221; for the purposes of the Act, provided that the Secretary of State considers that the proposed circumstances involve dissolution, insolvency or financial difficulty, or are similar to those for the time being prescribed in sections 4 to 7 of the 2010 Act. That seems sensible and we have no problem with the clauses or the schedule standing part of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="e.146.6/1">My right hon. Friend will appreciate that this part of the Bill is designed to assist those who have insurance claims against parties that are now defunct, where insurance was originally in place to cover such claims. In theory, that could cover a motor insurance claim, but it is certainly not designed specifically to that end. Likewise, the cost of motor insurance will be determined by claims by the insurance companies themselves, so it is not envisaged that this will affect the cost of motor insurance.</p>

	<p pid="e.147.3/1">Part 7 deals with technical matters such as commencement, territorial extent and consequential amendments to existing legislation. The Bill repeals or amends various sections of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, which are superseded by provisions in parts 2 and 3. Clause 23 provides that the Bill extends to the whole of the United Kingdom, and that the provisions on insurance contract law will come into force 18 months after Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="e.147.3/2">From a practical perspective, the new provisions will not apply to existing insurance contracts, but rather to new contracts and variations agreed after the Bill comes into effect. The regulation-making power on the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010 will come into force two months after Royal Assent.</p>

	<p pid="e.147.4/1">As the Minister has said, clause 21 makes provisions consequential on part 2 and amends or repeals various sections of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, as well as the Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012. She has also confirmed that clause 22 ensures that those provisions relating to fair presentation and good faith apply only to insurance contracts entered into after the end of the period of 18 months from the Bill&#8217;s entry into force. Clause 23 ensures that the Bill extends to the whole of the UK, apart from consequential provisions in clause 21 relating to Northern Ireland.

	<p pid="e.147.5/3">Together with the Consumer Insurance (Disclosure and Representations) Act 2012 that preceded it, the Bill marks the biggest reform to insurance contract law in more than a century. It is the product of careful consultation and consideration, and as a result it is well supported. It demonstrates the Government&#8217;s commitment to maintaining and growing the UK&#8217;s insurance industry both at home and abroad. I am grateful to all insurers, businesses and others who have supported the Bill, and to those who have participated in the Law Commission&#8217;s project and the legislative process. I am also grateful for the contribution made by the Opposition in both Houses towards the smooth passage of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="e.148.0/1">I, too, thank everyone who has worked on this important Bill, including the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission. It has been interesting to follow the special procedure. There is no doubt that the Bill was rigorously scrutinised in the other place, and a number of amendments were tabled. That perhaps makes our task in Committee and on Third Reading somewhat easier, and will help to ensure that the Bill safely completes its passage through the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/2">I raised one issue that was originally suggested in the Law Commission reports but did not make it into the Bill: late payment. I want to give the Minister the opportunity to reply, but to recap briefly, the Law Commission report states:</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/3">&#8220;We consider that a policyholder should have a remedy where an insurer has acted unreasonably in delaying or refusing payment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/4">It recommended</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/5">&#8220;an implied term in every insurance contract that the insurer will pay sums due within a reasonable time&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/6">with appropriate caveats. Those points were deemed too controversial to be included in a Law Commission Bill, and as I have said before, although the recommendations have merit, I recognise that a Law Commission Bill may not be the appropriate vehicle for putting such provisions into statute because of the way that &#8220;controversial&#8221; is interpreted.</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/7">I asked the Minister whether she would consider legislating for late payment by some other means. She offered encouragement on that and also said that</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/8">&#8220;evidence presented to the Law Commission, the Treasury and the Special Public Bill Committee demonstrated that the problems in the existing law are worse in theory than in practice.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Insurance </i><i>Bill Second Reading </i><i>Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2015-01-26">26 January 2015</phrase>; c. 9.]</p>
	<p pid="e.148.0/9">Although the Minister provided some encouragement, she perhaps also suggested that such measures would not be a priority for the immediate future. It would be helpful if she clarified that point and said whether the Government have plans to take the issue forward and to what time scale. In general terms, the Bill has taken us forward and is largely technical in how it updates insurance law in statute. We have given it a good airing and should see it successfully enacted.</p>

	<p pid="e.148.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving me the chance to put on the record the fact that the Government support the principle that insurers should make payment of valid claims within a reasonable time, and that they should be liable for compensation where appropriate should they fail to do</p>
	<p pid="e.148.1/2">so. The Government are always looking at ways to support and improve the position of the UK insurance industry, and it is hoped that legislative opportunities will arise to include that measure with other insurance-related provisions.</p>
	<p pid="e.148.1/3">As the hon. Lady will know, the Government undertook a targeted consultation of insurance industry stakeholders in summer 2014 to assess support for the Bill and for a provision on late payment. The results of the consultation suggested that the late payment provision was not suitable for a Bill going through Parliament under the special procedure reserved for uncontroversial Law Commission Bills. The main arguments against such a provision were that it could lead to speculative litigation, or have the unwelcome effect of being used to exert undue pressure to expedite claim settlement, and those costs have not yet been quantified. Furthermore, adequate customer protections already exist, so the problems of late payment are worse in theory than in practice. The Financial Conduct Authority is currently undertaking a thematic review into the handling of commercial claims, and the issue is being considered from a regulatory angle.</p>
	<p pid="e.148.1/4">As the hon. Lady recognised, not all recommendations made by the Law Commission are suitable for the special procedure for non-controversial Bills, and that provision was omitted from the Bill specifically to ensure that the special procedure was not abused. I repeat, however, that the Government support the principle that insurers should make payment of valid claims within a reasonable time.</p>
	<p pid="e.148.1/5" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="e.148.1/6" class="italic">Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.</p>

	<p pid="e.151.4/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House agrees with Lords amendment 1.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">Some right hon. and hon. Members may recall the important initiative on apprentices announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his autumn statement on <phrase class="date" code="2015-12-03">3 December</phrase>. The Chancellor announced that the Government will abolish employer class 1 national insurance contributions for apprentices under the age of 25 from April 2016, building on the removal of employer class 1 national insurance contributions for all under 21-year-olds from April 2015.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/3">Amendments to section 9 and new section 9B of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 give effect to the Government&#8217;s intention to abolish employer class 1 NICs for apprentices under the age of 25. From April 2016, employers of apprentices under the age of 25 will pay a zero rate of secondary class 1 NICs on the earnings of those employees, and that zero rate will apply to earnings below the upper earnings limit.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/4">As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear, apprenticeships are at the heart of the Government&#8217;s drive to equip people of all ages with the skills valued by employers. This measure is intended to support employers who provide apprenticeships to young people by removing the requirement that they pay secondary class 1 NICs on earnings up to the upper earnings limit for those employees. The measure is also intended to support youth employment. Under this Government, employment is at its highest ever level while unemployment is now lower than when the Government came to power. However, there is more to do to tackle youth unemployment and ensure that no one is left behind.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/5">The amendment provides a zero rate of employer class 1 national insurance contributions on the earnings of apprentices under the age of 25 from <phrase class="date" code="2016-04-06">6 April 2016</phrase>. The measure will apply to both new and existing apprentices aged under 25 and is not time limited.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/6">The main features of the clause are, first, that there is a regulation-making power to define &#8220;apprentice&#8221;. There are existing statutory definitions relating to apprenticeships. For example, in England and Wales, the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 introduced the concept of an apprenticeship agreement, which is defined in part with reference to &#8220;an apprentice&#8221;. Because education and training is a devolved matter, and because not all apprentices are employed under apprenticeship agreements, we will need to look at the approaches taken towards</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/7">apprenticeships in the different devolved Administrations. The power will allow time to discuss the definition with interested parties such as the Skills Funding Agency and their devolved equivalents. The power will also enable us to respond simply to changing statutory definitions and requirements in future.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/8">Secondly, there are regulation-making powers to vary the age group to which the zero rate of secondary class 1 NICs for apprentices applies. For example, the Government could in future allow for an increase in the age bracket of apprentices falling into the zero rate earnings band of secondary class 1 NICs.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/9">Thirdly, there is a regulation-making power to ensure that the benefit of the zero rate of secondary class 1 NICs for apprentices can be enjoyed only in respect of earnings below a certain level. In other words, the power will provide a means to introduce an upper secondary threshold for apprentices in the same way as we are doing for under 21s. That threshold will be set at the level of the upper earnings limit in the 2016-17 tax year.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/10">The Government&#8217;s objective is to make all apprenticeships world class. Around &#163;1.5 billion is spent annually to support apprenticeship training, and the Government are committed to driving up the quality of apprenticeships. We are currently taking forward a number of reforms that will have a positive impact. The Government believe that the measure will, alongside other initiatives on apprenticeships and the abolition of employer&#8217;s NICs for under 21s from April 2015, help to address the problem of youth unemployment in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="e.151.4/11">I hope that, with that explanation, the House will accept the amendment made in the other place.</p>

	<p pid="e.152.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for introducing Lords amendment 1, which was the main amendment made in the other place. As he said, it enacts the announcement made in the autumn statement that employer national insurance contributions for apprentices aged under 25 will be abolished from April 2016. The Opposition support the measure. There is agreement on both sides of the House and across party political boundaries that we need more apprenticeships; and that youth unemployment, and long-term youth unemployment, remain a problem not only for the individuals involved, but for the economy as a whole. We hope the measure helps to alleviate that somewhat.</p>
	<p pid="e.152.0/2">The Minister said that there is a regulation-making power within the measure for the definition of &#8220;apprentice&#8221; and referenced the 2009 Act definition, which relates to an apprenticeship contract. That concern was raised in the other place when the measure was debated. Will he give the House more information about progress in discussions with the devolved legislatures about the definition to be applied? How confident is he that the provision will not be manipulated in a way that enables a reduction by companies of their tax liabilities? The lack of a definition of &#8220;apprentice&#8221; causes concern that that might arise.</p>
	<p pid="e.152.0/3">The current quality of apprenticeships has come under scrutiny in this Parliament. A recent report from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills showed that 15% of apprentices are paid below the national minimum wage, and that 28% of level 2 and</p>
	<p pid="e.152.0/4">level 3 apprentices who do not have a written contract are paid below the national minimum wage. We also know that one in five apprentices receive no formal training. Will the Minister consider a stipulation on quality when he looks at the definition of apprentice? That would go some way to alleviating some of the concerns raised about potential gaps in the measure that could lead to abuse, or to a proliferation of apprenticeships that are not of a high quality and that do not add too much to the future prospects of the young people engaged in them. It would be helpful to hear the Minister&#8217;s further comments on those points.</p>

	<p pid="e.153.0/1">I welcome the hon. Lady&#8217;s support for the measures. It is worth noting the considerable progress made on apprenticeships under this Government. We have created 2 million apprenticeships in this Parliament, which is giving young people the skills they need to succeed in the global race and get on in life. That is significant progress&#8212;progress on the number of apprenticeships has been considerably faster than was previously expected. For example, the previous Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, said in 2008 that he intended to have 90,000 more young people taking part in apprenticeships by 2013. He said that, together with opportunities for those in their 20s and older, that would mean 220,000 people starting an apprenticeship each year overall. In 2011-12, 520,000 people started an apprenticeship, so we can see that there has been dramatic progress. The measure helps us to pursue that policy yet further.</p>

	<p pid="e.153.1/1">I am curious and intrigued as to how the Minister will define an apprenticeship these days. I was an apprentice in the construction industry. I served a four-year apprenticeship from the age of 16 to the age of 20. My father had to sign my indentures to say that I was indentured to that company, and possibly sold into slavery in a way. What is an apprenticeship these days? The Minister talks about half a million new apprenticeships, but are they apprenticeships as I understand them?</p>

	<p pid="e.153.2/1">The hon. Gentleman goes to the heart of the question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> about who will qualify for the relief. As I have remarked, we are taking a power to define apprenticeships. Given that this is a devolved matter, it is important that we discuss it with the devolved Administrations. We want to support apprenticeships and will seek to achieve a broad definition for the purposes of the relief. However, the apprenticeship system across the UK is complex and evolving. Education and training is a devolved matter. Apprenticeships operate slightly differently in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and there are differences between Government-funded apprenticeships and independent employer schemes. The Government will discuss the definition of &#8220;an apprentice&#8221; with the Skills Funding Agency and its devolved equivalents before committing ourselves to a final definition. It is important that the definition is robust, satisfying minimum compliance standards while achieving the objective of supporting the provision of apprenticeships to the under 25s.</p>
	<p pid="e.153.2/2">In terms of overall support for apprenticeships, the Government have done a great deal. We spend about &#163;1.5 billion annually to support apprenticeship training. In Budget 2014, &#163;170 million of additional funding was made available for apprenticeship grants for employers in 2014-16, providing a grant of up to &#163;1,500 per apprentice for small businesses. The new budget will fund more than 100,000 additional incentive payments for employers to take on young apprentices.</p>
	<p pid="e.153.2/3">It is also worth pointing out that in 2012 the National Audit Office recognised the strengths of the Government&#8217;s apprenticeship programme, highlighting how it continued to be valued by learners and businesses. It concluded that public spending on apprenticeships offered a good return, estimated at &#163;18 for each &#163;1 of Government investment. Evidence from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggests that returns may be higher, at &#163;28 for every &#163;1 of Government investment. I hope Members will resist the temptation to criticise the substantial progress that has been made on apprenticeships over the course of this Parliament. It has been significant.</p>
	<p pid="e.153.2/4">On the definition of apprentices, which I touched on earlier, there will need to be discussion with the devolved Administrations and the Skills Funding Agency. We want a robust definition, but we have to bear in mind the complexities in this area.</p>
	<p pid="e.153.2/5">On eligibility, for a business to be eligible to work with training providers to create an apprenticeship programme, the employer offering an apprenticeship needs to employ an apprentice for a minimum of 30 hours per week, pay at least the national minimum wage for apprentices, support on-the-job learning and be involved in reviewing their progress. On the question raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood regarding manipulation, I would make the point that those safeguards are in the system.</p>
	<p pid="e.153.2/6">One further point I believe is important is that, as the Government are doing with employment allowance and under-21s from April this year and as we did when we came to office and increased the threshold before employer national insurance contributions is paid, we have done a great deal to reduce the burden on businesses of employer national insurance contributions. That has helped in creating the substantial progress in employment we have seen in recent years. Had we pursued the policy we inherited&#8212;an increase in the jobs tax&#8212;we would not have seen that progress.</p>

	<p pid="e.154.0/1">On reducing the burden on business, the Government have previously considered the notion of merging national insurance. Has the Minister made any progress down that line? I am acutely aware that national insurance still creates the impression that people have contributed to a fund out of which benefits are paid, when of course they are mostly pay-as-you-go. Can we reduce the burden on business by simplifying national insurance by simplifying the overall tax system?</p>

	<p pid="e.154.1/1">My hon. Friend raises an interesting point in this context. He is absolutely right that the Office of Tax Simplification recommended we looked at that. There is quite a lot going on in relation to payroll: devolution of income tax in Scotland, the auto-enrolment of pensions and the introduction of real-time information to the payroll system. They have caused considerable</p>
	<p pid="e.154.1/2">challenges&#8212;all for good reason; all are doing much to improve the tax system&#8212;and we have held off pursuing further integration of income tax and the national insurance contributions system.</p>
	<p pid="e.154.1/3">My hon. Friend was right to raise a point about people&#8217;s understanding of the tax system and greater transparency. The Government have introduced tax summaries so that people can see how much they are paying in income tax and national insurance. That brings greater transparency to our tax system, so we have made progress on that front. On the integration of national insurance and income tax more widely, it remains a position we continue to review. Some evidence from internal reviews was that the benefits to business of bringing the two systems together were perhaps not as great as some outside commentators had anticipated. In those circumstances, we did not want to rush into this matter, but I assure my hon. Friend that we continue to keep it under review.</p>

	<p pid="e.155.0/1">Will the Minister remind me whether tax summaries include employers&#8217; national insurance? I am always conscious that when we are employees we must generate an amount of value for our employer somewhat greater than even our gross pay, so is employers&#8217; national insurance contribution also reflected in the summary? If not, could it be?</p>

	<p pid="e.155.1/1">There is a reference to employers&#8217; national insurance contribution. The tax summaries state how much is paid in income tax and in employees&#8217; national insurance contributions. There is also a line in the summaries saying, &#8220;Your employer has paid this much employers&#8217; national insurance contribution.&#8221; Returning to the issue directly before us in relation to apprenticeships, there is an argument&#8212;I think a lot of economists would make this point&#8212;that ultimately the burden of employers&#8217; national insurance contributions is taken up by the employee, as they receive less in salary as a consequence. There is also a case that it may be a disincentive for employers to take on employees.</p>
	<p pid="e.155.1/2">We believe this sensible and well-targeted measure will encourage businesses to take on apprentices. We have not focused particularly on the limit, but there is provision to prevent manipulation such as the classifying of premier league footballers as apprentices, which might result in a 24-year-old footballer paying no NICs on a salary of &#163;1 million. We have sought to address such abuses.</p>

	<p pid="e.155.3/1">We anticipate that there will be about 3 million apprenticeships over the course of the next Parliament. The provision will come into effect in 2016-17. Not every apprentice is under 25, so not every apprentice will benefit from the provisions, but a large number of apprentices in the next Parliament will benefit.</p>
	<p pid="e.155.3/2">Overall, we estimate that about 180,000 employers offering apprenticeships in the UK are likely to benefit from the measure. Apprenticeship data from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills for England for the 2013-14 academic year show that about</p>
	<p pid="e.155.3/3">500,000 apprentices under the age of 25 are employed throughout the country, and we estimate that about 130,000 apprentices in England are aged 21 to 24. That group will be directly affected by the measure, with those under 21 already benefiting from the zero rate for under-21s from April this year. I hope that information is helpful to the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.155.3/4">Many Members were delighted by the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement on apprenticeships in the autumn statement, which demonstrated, yet again, the Government&#8217;s commitment to apprenticeships. If we wish to succeed in the global race, we need a well-educated and well-trained work force and to support employers who provide the training and experience that young people need if they are to be more productive and effective and more likely to make a substantial contribution to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="e.155.3/5">Quite rightly, we often debate how to improve living standards, but ultimately it is down to improvements in productivity. As the economist Paul Krugman said&#8212;I do not often quote him:</p>
	<p pid="e.155.3/6">&#8220;Productivity isn&#8217;t everything, but&#8230;it is almost everything&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.155.3/7">As part of our long-term economic plan, one measure we are taking to improve productivity is ensuring a well-trained work force, and encouraging apprenticeships is key to that. It is yet another aspect of our long-term economic plan. It will help us improve our productivity, and as productivity increases, so too will wages, salaries and living standards.</p>

	<p pid="e.156.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. As I said, the Government invest about &#163;1.5 billion a year in apprenticeships. In its 2012 report, the NAO suggested that for every &#163;1 spent in this area, we got a return of &#163;18, and studies by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggest that the return might be even greater: &#163;28 for every &#163;1 invested. Therefore, this offers good value for money. Our policy on apprenticeships is an additional step, and I am delighted that the tax system can be used in this way. Once again, it demonstrates that the Government are on the side of those who wish to work hard, improve their skills and get on in life</p>

	<p pid="e.157.3/2">It might help the House if I briefly outline the four amendments. Amendments 2 and 3 are the Government&#8217;s response to the report, published on <phrase class="date" code="2015-11-27">27 November</phrase>, by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on the delegated powers contained in the Bill. The report drew to the House&#8217;s attention the power in clause 2 to amend primary and secondary legislation as a consequence of the reform of class 2 NICs. This power is currently subject to the negative procedure. The Committee said that the justification in HMRC&#8217;s &#8220;Delegated Powers Memorandum&#8221; was not sufficient for the negative procedure to apply where the power allows for the amendment or repeal of primary legislation, and the Committee recommended that in this instance the power be subject to the affirmative procedure. The Government have considered and acted on the Committee&#8217;s report. Lords amendment 2 provides that regulations made under clause 2 that amend or repeal primary legislation be subject to the affirmative procedure. Lords amendment 3 provides that the negative procedure will continue to apply to any use of the power set out in clause 2 where a statutory instrument does not contain any regulations amending or repealing primary legislation.</p>

This is a matter that I have previously debated, if not at great length, with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase>. Amendment 4 amends schedule 1, which inserts new section 11A into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. It will ensure that the relevant self-assessment penalties apply to class 2 contributions collected through SA by adding a missing reference to the SA under-declaration penalty contained in schedule 24 to the Finance Act 2007. It was always the Government&#8217;s intention to align penalties for class 2 contributions more closely with those for SA as part of the reform of class 2 so that the self-employed are not subject to two different regimes, but this penalty was unintentionally omitted. Lords amendment 5 makes a corresponding amendment to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.</p>
	<p pid="e.157.3/4">With that explanation, which I know the House was keen to hear, I hope it will agree with the Lords amendments.</p>

Has any consideration been given to disapplying <phrase class="standing-order" code="16(1)">Standing Order No. 16(1)</phrase>, which allocates 90 minutes to consideration of the mitochondrial donation regulations? When similar regulations, concerning embryo research, came before the House in 2000, some 3 hours and 19 minutes were taken. Through the usual channels, the House has previously disapplied Standing Orders when dealing with issues of great significance, not least in this area. Obviously, many are concerned about the significant impact of these regulations, not least in respect of mothers at risk of passing on serious diseases to their children. This matter is of great significance to the country, because, for the first time in the world, we would be permitting human germ-line genetic modification. Given the significance of these matters, not just for those in the House but for the public, and in the interest of considering them in detail, I would have thought these matters deserved fuller debate and scrutiny, although I respect the fact that we will be turning to a general debate on rural phone and broadband connectivity afterwards. Given all that and the significant safety and legal issues, as well as ethical issues, surely we need longer than 90 minutes. Has any consideration been given to disapplying Standing Orders?</p>

	<p pid="e.158.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman both for his point of order and for his usual courtesy in notifying me in advance of its intended content. I am very sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman, but I fear&#8212;I say this in all sincerity&#8212;that I am unable to help him. The hon. Gentleman is right that it is within the power of Ministers to propose an extension of time available for a debate to which the 90-minute limit under <phrase class="standing-order" code="16">Standing Order No. 16</phrase> applies. Notice is required, and there is no such motion on today&#8217;s Order Paper. I am clear that that is extremely regrettable, so far as the hon. Gentleman is concerned and many other Members may feel likewise. But we are where we are. In practical terms, the possibility of proposing such an extension is in the hands of the Government business managers, and is not available to Back Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="e.158.1/2">The hon. Gentleman knows my views about the importance of empowering Back Benchers, and I have never been much fussed about empowering Ministers in any Administration, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Obviously, however, the Speaker has to operate within the established procedures of the House. As far as I can see&#8212;I have taken advice on the matter&#8212;today&#8217;s business must therefore conclude after an hour and a half.</p>
	<p pid="e.158.1/3">The Minister is always a most courteous Minister, and she will have taken note of what has been said. Knowing the Minister as I do, I know she is planning to</p>
	<p pid="e.158.1/4">be pithy in her remarks to facilitate the majority of Back Benchers. About 18 Members wish to speak in the debate. If Members help each other, it will maximise the number of contributors. I fear we will have to leave it there for now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-02-03e.160.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40064" speakername="Jane Ellison" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="160"  time="014:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150203/debtext/150203-0002.htm#150203-0002.htm_spmin1">
	<p pid="e.160.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="e.160.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That the draft Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Mitochondrial Donation) Regulations 2015, which were laid before this House on <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-17">17 December 2014</phrase>, be approved.</p>
	<p pid="e.160.1/3">Mitochondria are present in almost every cell in the body and produce the energy we need to function. This is why they are often referred to as &#8220;the battery pack&#8221; of the cell. Unhealthy mitochondria can cause severe medical disorders, known as mitochondrial disease, for which there is no cure. The techniques provided for by these regulations offer the only hope for some women who carry the disease to have healthy, genetically related children who will not suffer from the devastating and often fatal consequences of serious mitochondrial disease.</p>
	<p pid="e.160.1/4">First, I would like to bring the House up to date with the process followed since the principle of mitochondrial donation was first debated by Parliament during the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 in 2007-08. There has been much consideration of this issue in this Parliament. Over the last five years, there has been extensive engagement and consultation with the public on this issue, including an ethical assessment by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics in 2012; a public dialogue and consultation exercise carried out by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in 2012-13; and a public consultation on draft regulations carried out by the Department of Health in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="e.160.1/5">There have been three reports into the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial donation techniques by an expert panel convened by the HFEA which were published in 2011, 2013 and 2014. The expert panel members were selected for their broad-ranging scientific and clinical expertise, and for having no direct or commercial interest in the outcome of the review. Indeed, Professor Frances Flinter, a genetics consultant who works with affected families, has said:</p>
	<p pid="e.160.1/6">&#8220;There has been more scientific review of this proposed process than any other medical technology.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="e.160.2/1">The Minister says that there is no point in further review, but the safety tests recommended by the HFEA in its three reports have not yet been completed, written up or peer reviewed. Does that sound like a completed analysis?</p>

	<p pid="e.160.3/1">I will come to that point in my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="e.160.3/2">There has been much parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals, including three parliamentary debates and over 200 parliamentary questions in both Houses. As part of this parliamentary scrutiny, the Science and Technology Committee held an evidence session into mitochondrial donation in October last year. Following the hearing, the Chair, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40244" name="Andrew Miller">the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase> who I see in his place, wrote to me on behalf of the Committee, expressing the opinion that there was sufficient information for Parliament to make an informed decision, and urging the Government to bring forward regulations. Given the extensive scrutiny in this Parliament, I believe it is right to allow this</p>
	<p pid="e.160.3/3">Parliament to decide whether to take the next step for mitochondrial donation, which can progress only with these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="e.160.3/4">The two proposed techniques, maternal spindle transfer and pro-nuclear transfer, are covered by the regulations. They are about replacing the battery pack that contains a small number of unhealthy genes with a healthy battery pack. Mitochondrial DNA is just 0.054% of our overall DNA and none of our nuclear DNA, which determines our personal characteristics and traits and is not altered by mitochondrial donation.</p>
	<p pid="e.160.3/5">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the scientists at Newcastle university, who have led the world in the development of the new techniques&#8212;an area where Britain is at the forefront of life sciences.</p>

	<p pid="e.161.0/1">The Minister is extremely generous with her time. She says that these scientists are leading the way, but is she not aware of the work done in China over a decade ago in exactly this area? It was clearly pioneering, and it led to the Chinese Government outlawing the use of these techniques because of the appalling, tragic outcomes.</p>

	<p pid="e.161.2/1">Does the Minister acknowledge that scientists broadly accept that the procedures are nuclear cell transfer? That is what regulations 4 and 7 make clear. That means that nuclear DNA in the egg is explicitly altered. Therefore one has to agree that an honest, clear definition of what we are dealing with is genetic modification.</p>

	<p pid="e.161.3/1">No, I cannot accept that description. I recognise that my hon. Friend has objections to the procedure, but I do not recognise his description. Nuclear DNA is not affected; mitochondrial DNA is different.</p>
	<p pid="e.161.3/2">As well as paying tribute to the scientists at Newcastle university, I want to pay tribute to the Lilly Foundation, a charity founded by families who have lost their children to serious mitochondrial disease, and who have shown us the human suffering behind this scientific advance. Many right hon. and hon. Members, like me, have constituents who are affected, and I am sure that some Members will talk about such families in their own speeches.</p>

	<p pid="e.161.4/1">Does the Minister accept that a person born as a result of a mitochondrial replacement would not pass on mitochondrial disease to their successors? In other words, the germ line would have been modified so that the mitochondrial disease had stopped with their parents. It seems to me that if she accepts that the germ line has been modified, what she said a few moments ago cannot possibly be right.</p>

	<p pid="e.161.5/1">We have made it clear that the removal of the faulty mitochondria will be passed on to the next generation. That is exactly what we have been describing, but I do not accept my hon. Friend&#8217;s description of it as</p>
	<p pid="e.161.5/2">genetic modification. It has to be said that there is no universally agreed definition of genetic modification, but for the purposes of these regulations, we have used a working definition and it involves not altering the nuclear DNA.</p>

	<p pid="e.162.1/1">I know my hon. Friend is going to make her own contribution. If she will forgive me, I want to outline for the benefit of Members less familiar with the regulations their detailed content.</p>
	<p pid="e.162.1/2">Turning to that detail, the regulations are made under the powers in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. They were added to in 2008 to permit mitochondrial donation to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease, anticipating the advancement of science to this point. Regulations 3 to 5 set out the circumstances for mitochondrial donation techniques using eggs; regulations 6 to 8 set out the circumstances for mitochondrial donation using embryos. They would allow the use of the two techniques that have been subjected to extensive UK-wide review and consultation: maternal spindle transfer and pro-nuclear transfer.</p>
	<p pid="e.162.1/3">Regulations 11 to 15 and 19 set out the information that can be provided about a mitochondrial donor to any child born from the donation and information to that donor. Regulations 16 and 17 set out special provisions around consent that were identified through the public consultation process. These regulations apply UK-wide, and the devolved Administrations have been kept informed of development and progress.</p>

	<p pid="e.162.2/1">Does the Minister consider that the Government&#8217;s own regulator, the HFEA, was wrong to state, in a consultation document that &#8220;PNT involves genetically modifying a human embryo&#8221;?</p>

	<p pid="e.162.3/1">I shall deal shortly with the regulatory regime that the HFEA would introduce. However, that and many other points have already been examined in great detail and responded to in great detail in parliamentary answers, to which I refer my hon. Friend.</p>

No one would deny that this is ground-breaking science&#8212;it is&#8212;but there have been three expert panel reviews. What I am trying to demonstrate in my speech is that we have taken all the necessary rigorous steps towards the point at which Parliament can make an informed decision. I think it important to differentiate things that are knowable and on which Parliament can make that informed decision, and things that can only be known when we take the next step, which involves making the regulations.

As I have said, three reports have been produced by the HFEA-convened expert panel during the current Parliament. On each occasion, the panel has concluded that there is nothing to indicate that the two donation techniques are unsafe. Although the panel has recommended that further experiments should be conducted, it expects such research to support the conclusions that it has reached so far.</p>
	<p pid="e.163.1/3">In public discussion, there has been some misunderstanding of the term &#8220;critical&#8221;, which was used by the expert panel. That is helpfully clarified in the HFEA&#8217;s introductory briefing note, which has been endorsed by the panel and which makes clear that the experiments could take place before or after the approval of regulations by Parliament. The chief medical officer sent a copy of the briefing note to all Members yesterday.</p>

	<p pid="e.163.6/1">I am sorry. I know that many Members wish to intervene, but I am trying to leave time for Back-Bench contributions.</p>
	<p pid="e.163.6/2">If the regulations are passed by Parliament, the HFEA will introduce a robust regulatory process, as it has in other areas of fertility treatment. The regulations would also establish important safeguards through the HFEA&#8217;s own licensing procedures. Before licences could be issued to providers of mitochondrial donation, they would have to demonstrate that they could carry out the procedure safely and effectively. Each provider would need to be licensed, and treatment for each patient would be approved on a case-by-case basis. Decisions would be based on the scientific evidence and advice that were submitted to the licensing committee. The HFEA is highly respected across the globe as a model for the regulation of fertility and embryology treatments and research. Many other countries do not have such a framework.</p>
	<p pid="e.163.6/3">I recognise that some Members disagree in principle with mitochondrial donation, and I respect their point of view, although I do not share it. To those who do not disagree in principle I have sought to demonstrate&#8212;as we have sought to demonstrate over the years of expert panel reviews and further consideration&#8212;that all reasonable and rigorous steps have been followed to reach the point at which Parliament can be asked to make an informed decision about whether to allow these techniques</p>
	<p pid="e.163.6/4">to be licensed on a case-by-case basis. It is a bold step for Parliament to take, but it is a considered and informed step.</p>

	<p pid="e.164.0/1">The impassioned and thoughtful contributions to the public debate that we have heard in recent weeks and months are testimony to what a sensitive and complex matter this is. Only last night, an event held in Committee Room 10 was attended by hundreds of people who are interested in the debate, and we heard representations from both sides.</p>
	<p pid="e.164.0/2">On one hand, we have celebrated the triumph of science that these new techniques represent. It is thanks to years of pioneering research by the university of Newcastle on how we can prevent the transmission of genetic mutations that we are finally reaching the point at which we can consider using these transformative techniques in humans. We have within our reach the possibility of eradicating mitochondrial disease from families who have been blighted by it for generations: families who have endured a disease for which there is no cure, who have suffered daily battles with painfully debilitating symptoms, and who have sadly lost their children prematurely. Those families have had to face up to the risk, and perhaps the certainty, that to be a parent must come at the expense of a difficult and, in too many cases, painful life for their children. Not only would children born through such techniques be free of such conditions, but so would their children and grandchildren. This treatment would break a chain of misery that would otherwise have ruined generations of lives.</p>
	<p pid="e.164.0/3">On the other hand, we are grappling with the serious ethical and moral questions that are raised by the proposed introduction of such techniques. Members have previously shared their anxiety about the uncharted territory in which we now find ourselves. The proposed regulations would make Britain the first country to legalise mitochondrial transfer, and scientists have acknowledged that there would always be a &#8220;leap of faith&#8221; the first time the technique was used.</p>

	<p pid="e.164.1/1">I think we need to dispel the myth that there will be a &#8220;first time&#8221;. This was done more than a decade ago. In its recent analysis, the HFEA ignored the Zhang study. The Minister is shaking her head. She has clearly not read the study, which showed that when the technique was first tried, triplets were conceived. One was terminated almost immediately&#8212;within 30 days&#8212;and, of the other two, one was stillborn and the other died as a result of miscarriage. That is the reality. This is not groundbreaking; it has been done before.</p>

The origin of mitochondria is bacteria that were engulfed by cells. They are very different. The House should be aware of that.</p>

	<p pid="e.165.5/2">Many concerns have been raised, the first of which is that this process is being rushed through. Anyone who has been involved in the development of these techniques would disagree that this has moved quickly. Professor Doug Turnbull and his team at the university of Newcastle have been researching this for 15 years. It was over six years ago, back in 2008, that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 was amended to introduce the powers to allow regulations that would enable mitochondria replacement to take place to be brought forward. It was back in 2010 that researchers at the university of Newcastle developed the techniques to avoid diseased mitochondria being passed from a mother to her children. After another three years of consultation and review processes, the Government announced in July this year that they would be bringing forward the regulations to enable mitochondrial donation techniques to be used, and that is what we are voting on today.</p>

	<p pid="e.166.2/1">I am going to finish my point, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="e.166.2/2">In the intervening years the science and ethics of these techniques have been extensively debated. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics and the HFEA held extensive public consultations in 2012 and identified broad public support for the use of these techniques. There have been three expert scientific review panels&#8212;in April 2011, March 2013 and June 2014&#8212;all of which found no evidence to suggest that the techniques are unsafe for clinical use, and only last week a group of eminent scientists and experts in medical ethics, including Professor Sir John Sulston, Baroness Warnock and Sir Paul Nurse, wrote to <i>The Times </i>urging Parliament to approve the new regulations. They argued that the question parliamentarians must consider is not whether we would want to use this technique ourselves, but whether there are grounds to prevent affected families from doing so. I again reiterate what we have heard in the representations from families, and particularly women of child-bearing age: they want the opportunity to use these techniques.</p>

	<p pid="e.166.6/1">I am going to make some progress, because I am conscious&#8212;referring back to the intervention of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase>&#8212;that we have limited time and many Back Benchers wish to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="e.166.6/2">It is important to note that the use of these techniques will not be rushed into lightly if Parliament does pass them today, and specialist clinicians will then have to obtain a licence from the HFEA to use the techniques. We heard last night that this will only be in centres of excellence, and the HFEA will consider applications on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="e.166.6/3">We have heard concerns in previous debates that allowing mitochondrial donation is a dangerous road to start down, and that it could potentially lead to designer babies and parents being able to select the physical characteristics of their children. But we have also heard</p>
	<p pid="e.166.6/4">in the public debate that these fears do not take into account that these regulations are very specific and cover only mitochondrial DNA, not the nuclear DNA that determine our physical characteristics. The legislation only permits the use of these techniques in the clearly defined situation of incurable mitochondrial disorders.</p>
	<p pid="e.166.6/5">The fact that these techniques apply only to the mitochondrial DNA and not to nuclear DNA should provide further reassurance to those Members concerned that this process would result in &#8220;three-parent babies.&#8221; As we have heard, mitochondrial DNA only controls mitochondrial function and energy production. Importantly, nuclear DNA, which makes us who we are and determines appearance and personality, will not be altered by the techniques that we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid="e.166.6/6">The regulations clarify that a mitochondrial donor is not to be treated as a parent, in contrast to the legal position for sperm and egg donors, who are treated as people who would, or might, be the legal parent of a child born from their donation.</p>
	<p pid="e.166.6/7">There are questions around the safety of these techniques. As we have heard, this technique has received unprecedented scrutiny by the HFEA&#8217;s specially convened expert scientific review panel. However, it is possible that side effects could emerge over time and scientists have acknowledged that there would always have to be a &#8220;leap of faith&#8221; the first time the technique is used in humans.</p>

The scientific community and the families experiencing mitochondrial disease say that they do; and according to research, almost 2,500 women in Britain of child-bearing age are at risk of passing the condition on to their children. It is now up to Members to decide whether they agree.</p>

	<p pid="e.168.4/2">Human mitochondrial disease is a dreadful condition and, as a caring society, we must do all we can to address it, and do so as sensitively as we can for those families affected by it. As a caring society, however, we must also do so in an ethical manner and with proper regard for safety. I believe that the regulations we are considering today fail on both counts&#8212;ethics and safety&#8212;and that they are inextricably interlinked.</p>
	<p pid="e.168.4/3">Let me be straightforward: I do oppose these proposals in principle. However, that should not prevent my concerns regarding their safety from being given a fair hearing. One of the two procedures that we are being asked to sanction today&#8212;pro-nuclear transfer&#8212;involves the deliberate creation and destruction of at least two human embryos, and in practice probably more, to create a third embryo, which it is hoped will be free of human mitochondrial disease. Are we happy to sacrifice two early human lives to make a third life?</p>

	<p pid="e.168.6/1">Let me put it this way. Some may take the view that at such an early stage of human life, it is acceptable deliberately to create human embryos to then destroy them. However, the truth is that once upon a time I was an embryo and so was every other Member in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="e.168.6/2">This debate is about the principle of genetically altering&#8212;indeed, genetically creating&#8212;a human being, and no matter how well meaning the motives, and my heart goes out to the families with mitochondrial disease, this technique will not cure that disease.

As I say, this technique will involve the permanent alteration of the human genetic code. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which was cited by the shadow Minister in support of her arguments, says that these techniques are</p>
	<p pid="e.169.1/2">&#8220;a form of germline gene therapy.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="e.169.3/1">I was indeed surprised, but in a sense that is why those who have made the case for much more parliamentary time and debate on this issue are quite right.</p>
	<p pid="e.169.3/2">There will be no going back for society and certainly not for the individuals and children involved. My hon. Friend the Minister said that we have taken all rigorous steps before bringing this matter to the House, but it is profoundly concerning that the outstanding pre-clinical trials, as recommended by the HFEA panel, have still not been undertaken, written up and peer-reviewed. Will my hon. Friend confirm that, setting aside the completion of pre-clinical trials, there have been no clinical trials of these procedures, that there will be no clinical trials of them and that, in effect, if we pass the regulations the techniques will be applied to the creation of children without clinical trials? In other words, we will be approving uncontrolled experimentation&#8212;because there will be no controls&#8212;on children. In the absence of clinical trials, would that not effectively contravene EU regulations?</p>

	<p pid="e.170.1/1">That is exactly the point I was about to make. As has been highlighted in a letter from 44 MEPs who have written from the European Parliament this week to the Secretary of State for Health, the EU directives&#8212;the European clinical trials directive 2001, which was confirmed by the 2014 directive in the same area&#8212;state that</p>
	<p pid="e.170.1/2">&#8220;No gene therapy trials may be carried out which result in modifications to the subject&#8217;s germ line genetic identity.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.170.1/3">My hon. Friend the Minister indicated that in some way these particular procedures were excluded from these trials. That cannot be correct. The European clinical trials directive 2001 applies to clinical trials involving germ-line engineering. It applies to all clinical trials using medicine, and to these procedures. For the Department of Health to argue that it can move straight to using these procedures on children without clinical trials gives us, apart from anything else, one reason to vote against these regulations.</p>
	<p pid="e.170.1/4">If anyone doubts that, Lord Brennan QC has given a legal opinion on these regulations, which is of central importance. He says:</p>
	<p pid="e.170.1/5">&#8220;It is a well-established principle that EU law is to be interpreted&#8230;in light of the purpose, values, social and economic goals the provisions aim to achieve. Given that&#8230;both the Directive and the 2014 Regulation&#8230;ban any gene therapy trials that involve modification of the subject&#8217;s germ line identity, then it would clearly fall within their purposes and values to prevent their use in clinical practice of any procedure with that effect without investigation or trials first having taken place.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.170.1/6">I believe that this Government are at risk of infringement proceedings being brought against them if these proposals go ahead.</p>

	<p pid="e.170.5/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="e.170.5/2">Once we approve this procedure, where will it lead? The answer has to be that we stop here and say, &#8220;This is a red line in our country, as in every other country in the world, that we will not cross.&#8221; This is the place for that to be said. As MPs, we are accountable to the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid="e.170.5/3">The Government&#8217;s own consultation in July 2014 received 1,857 responses, of which 1,152 were opposed to the introduction of these techniques. That has been confirmed by ComRes polling last weekend, which showed that more than twice as many people are against these proposals as are in favour&#8212;41% of respondents, compared with 21%. A third public survey, being conducted today on <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>website, shows that as of this morning 68% of the public oppose these techniques in principle. Do their concerns not deserve respect from those of us present here?</p>
	<p pid="e.170.5/4">The truth is that the Government have not waited for the conclusion of trials, as they should have done, so that this House could make a fully informed decision, and that is wrong. Whether one ultimately approves or disapproves of these proposals, the right procedure on such a profound issue is for the elected representatives of the people of this country to have full information before being rushed into a decision, as we would be today if we voted for these proposals.</p>

When these pioneering techniques started, nobody knew the answers for certain. People made judgments&#8212;scientific judgments&#8212;on the best available evidence, and it turned out that people&#8217;s fears were ill-founded.</p>
	<p pid="e.171.0/2">The trials that have been undertaken on this work have led the scientific community&#8212;a powerful group of scientists with an extraordinary degree of knowledge in this area&#8212;to conclude that the risks are small but worth taking because the benefits on the other side of the equation are enormous. In all cases where there are risks, we need to consider the risks as against the benefits. I put it to the House that there are potential benefits for the about 2,500 families affected by mitochondrial disease up and down this nation, and they deserve our support. Of course we have to assess the risks, as we do with all risks, but that has to be done in a rational and balanced way.</p>

Everyone in this House wants the best for these families&#8212;there is no doubt about that&#8212;but it is the speed of the introduction of the regulations that concerns us. As for experimentation, I heard today that no trials are being carried out on primates, which are as close to us as can be. This process has proved successful on mice, but on primates&#8212;a standard part of this procedure, apparently&#8212;it has not been carried out, and that is interesting.</p>

	<p pid="e.171.2/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point, but there are plenty of occasions when such tests are not carried out. In central Africa we have been testing Ebola vaccines without first testing them on primates, because the benefits outweigh the risks. We are in that position already. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South referred to research undertaken in China 10 years ago. He rightly said that that work took place, but I put it to Members of this House that the ethical and scientific rigour applied to experimentation in the UK far exceeds anything in China 10 years ago. Indeed, the technologies have also moved on to a very high degree since then.</p>

This one affects a very small group of the population but does so in such a profound way. Although there are issues that need properly regulating, the regulatory structure that we have created does that properly. The Minister was asked about, and indeed mentioned, the issues associated with designer babies. Of course this House would want to impose limits, but we are considering a specific set of regulations about dealing with mitochondrial disease&#8212;they do nothing else. I, for one, would not stand here to defend the concept of designer babies and people choosing eye colour and so on. Today, we are dealing purely with those terrible illnesses.</p>

But this is about focusing on the needs of that small part of the population that I mentioned. I urge the House, in coming to a conclusion this afternoon, to think about those families, to focus on their needs and to set aside general beliefs in the overwhelming interest of that small part of the population who have suffered immensely and who have an opportunity at their disposal because of the extraordinary science that has been advanced.</p>

	<p pid="e.172.3/1">I approach this subject with a considerable degree of humility, for two reasons. First, I will never forget meeting a family in my constituency whose child suffers from mitochondrial disease; there was both a haunting sorrow in that family and also the hope that if these regulations are passed they will be able to have a child without this problem. Secondly, I am very aware of my own shortcomings in relation to biological science. As a chartered engineer, I am perhaps more competent in the physical sciences, and I do not mind admitting that I had to look up at least a few of the words in the regulations in order to understand them.</p>
	<p pid="e.172.3/2">As I have listened to this debate, not only today, but previously, I have wondered whether we have really reflected on how science proceeds, because scientific truth is not established by authority or by democratic vote; it is established, as Karl Popper put it, through &#8220;conjecture and refutation&#8221;&#8212;trial and error. Someone who reads Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s &#8220;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&#8221; will discover that it is possible for quite</p>
	<p pid="e.172.3/3">large bodies of knowledge to be developed with errors in them. When those errors are corrected, the paradigm shifts&#8212;that is a term we have all heard. That is how science proceeds, through trial and error. The reality is that there will always be uncertainty in any scientific procedure.</p>
	<p pid="e.172.3/4">When the Commons Library summarised the Nuffield Council on Bioethics&#8217; review, the second point mentioned was this:</p>
	<p pid="e.172.3/5">&#8220;The knowledge about these techniques is uncertain and could remain so for several generations&#8212;their use could potentially harm future persons.&#8221;</p>

Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger)</phrase>, speaking from the Front Bench, made the point that, broadly, the question before us was whether there was a reason to withhold these techniques from people. If there is a reason, it is that they may do harm to future persons. I will not support the measure because this is inherently uncertain. That uncertainty is an inherent part of science, and it is no good appealing to authority to try to resolve the question, because different authorities will disagree and there is no way to resolve those disagreements apart from through empirical evidence, which we can obtain only by experimenting on humans.</p>

Gentleman is absolutely right, which is why I began by expressing the humility I feel on this subject as a result of meeting and having had a lengthy conversation with a family who face just that issue. I remind myself, however, that we are dealing here not with a cure for those who have already been born, but with ensuring that those who are subsequently born do not suffer from that disease. If we were discussing a cure for those already living, perhaps the circumstances might be different.</p>

	<p pid="e.173.3/1">Prevention certainly is better than cure, but the question is: at what risk? I simply accept that on the earliest stages of human life there is a space for conscience; we will have different beliefs, some of which will be religious, and it is a matter of conscience. There are noble reasons for disagreeing about that stage and about what is and is not legitimate risk taking with human beings.</p>
	<p pid="e.173.3/2">The second point I wish to make is that in the course of this conversation there seems to have been what, at best, I could describe as &#8220;semantic sophistry&#8221; as to whether or not this process is genetic modification. As always, there is space for debate about the definition of terms, but the germ line is to be modified if these techniques go ahead. The Minister has stated that plainly&#8212;</p>

But for me the key thing is not so much where these parts of the DNA identity of a person came from, but where they are now. Each one of us has our own particular DNA identity. This procedure changes only a tiny part of it, but, having changed it, we cannot know what the future consequences will be. I know that families will be affected by the decision, but I have to say, with great sorrow, that, when it comes to human beings, this degree of uncertainty cannot be borne by my conscience and I shall be voting against the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="e.174.0/1">I have a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu, or perhaps d&#233;j&#224; entendu. The objections that have been brought out today, and in previous discussions, about mitochondrial disease are identical to those that arose when Louise Brown was brought into this world at Oldham general hospital as a result of the risky work undertaken by Steptoe and Edwards and Jean Purdy. That was a risk that the scientists were willing to take and that Mr and Mrs Brown were willing to take.</p>
	<p pid="e.174.0/2">Not long after I became a Member, Enoch Powell proposed a total ban on embryo research. I understand people&#8217;s ethical objections to embryo research, but if they object to something on principle, they do not need to add any other references to safety or effectiveness. If someone is opposed to it on principle, they are opposed to it, and I can respect that. When the Warnock report was published, this House had a creditable debate&#8212;to those who say that the House of Lords has a better quality of debate, I say that they should read its first debate on the Warnock report, and they might modify their views. All the things that are being said today were being said then, and all the things that were said in the debates about the establishment and development of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority were the same.</p>
	<p pid="e.174.0/3">In a previous speech, there were two novelties. One was that Robert Winston was being misquoted as opposing the proposal, which he cannot do any more as he actually wrote a full article in favour of it yesterday. The second was that US experts, some of the most distinguished experts who have written papers on the matter, were against it.</p>

	<p pid="e.174.3/2">The question arises: will it be safe and will it work? The answer is that no one can make any guarantees, but that is the nature of scientific development. The thing to remember is that mitochondrial disease is horrible and that there is no treatment for it. I remind people that the team at Newcastle university did not start off with this riskier novel approach. It has been studying and trying to come up with treatments for mitochondrial disease for the best part of 20 years, and is still doing so now. Some 90% of its work is trying to come up with a treatment. The best that it has managed to come up with after all these years is helping parents cope with</p>
	<p pid="e.174.3/3">the horrible symptoms before their children fade away and die. As has already been said, the team has decided that if it cannot come up with a treatment&#8212;and it is still trying&#8212;it would be better to prevent the disease arising in the first place because prevention is better than cure. That is why I hope the regulations will be passed and handed over to the HFEA. Members should realise that it is a credit to this country and to this House that the HFEA was established. We must find a middle way between the free-for-all, which a few nutters want, and the total ban, which some others want because they are opposed to embryo research on principle.</p>
	<p pid="e.174.3/4">The system that has been established is well regulated through the HFEA. Despite all the predictions to the contrary, there has not been a single scandal in all the time that the HFEA has been in existence. There has been no sign of a slippery slope. These people with great reputations at Newcastle think the time is right to take risks and to risk their reputations&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="e.176.5/1">It is simply that this legislation will open up research that is illegal, as I shall describe in a moment. I also think there are greater concerns about generations down the line.</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/2">The EU clinical trials directive, which applies to all clinical work, states:</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/3">&#8220;No gene therapy trials may be carried out that result in modification to the subject&#8217;s germline genetic identity.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/4">The HFEA itself has said that this procedure does. In the legal opinion on the regulations, Lord Brennan QC has said that they are caught by the directive and that they are</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/5">&#8220;likely to be in breach of EU law&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/6">on clinical trials.</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/7">The Department of Health examined the legal opinion but rejected it, saying that the licence will not be granted for clinical trial but for treatment and therefore will not be caught by that law. Apparently, this is not about clinical trials and furthering the science but about going straight for treatment.</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/8">Lord Brennan&#8217;s opinion anticipated that. He set out the relevant paragraphs from the 2011 report on safety from the review panel set up by the Secretary of State to monitor the procedures to the HFEA, which said:</p>
	<p pid="e.176.5/9">&#8220;Once assessed as safe to use in clinical practice, the panel strongly recommends that permission is sought from the parents of the children born from MST and PNT to be followed up for an extensive period&#8221;</p>

The HFEA is putting that child and, if they are female, subsequent generations at risk.</p>
	<p pid="e.177.1/3">Mr Speaker, I have only a minute left but my speech would cover more than that time. It is a ridiculous nonsense to try to ram through this statutory instrument in no time at all.

They open the gates to a procedure that is completely untested, with no pre-clinical trials or clinical trials. The regulations talk about going straight to treatment and that has all been done so that the Department of Health can wangle its way around the legislation, or so it thinks. This is terrible. It is not good for the families with this chronic, horrible disease. We need proper and considered research. If these regulations were on genetically modified crops, we would all be up in arms. That is what is happening here.</p>

	<p pid="e.178.2/1">I apologise to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House for missing the opening speech in the debate. Nevertheless, I was keen to speak because I think that the proposals before us today would tackle a real human need. There are parents who are currently bringing into the world children with a horrible disease and the suffering is made more acute by the fact that now, for the first time, those prospective parents know that they could be doing this procedure and they therefore face the dilemma of whether or not to have children.</p>
	<p pid="e.178.2/2">I realise that there are important objections. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase> put forward the ethical objection. I fully understand the fact that our benefit from this treatment does not of itself overcome the ethical issues, which are crucial. The red line to which she referred is, I think, a red line over which we have designer babies and change the DNA that makes the character of a person. I am persuaded by the scientific evidence that the mitochondria is not part of the core DNA that does that. In the previous debates and the previous legislation, it was absolutely clear that the red line that the House was trying to set was one that stopped the changing of human nature, and we do not cross it today.</p>

	<p pid="e.178.4/1">It is absolutely true that mitochondria can be inherited through the mother, but it does not change the character of the baby.</p>
	<p pid="e.178.4/2">Secondly, let me consider the health and safety objection. Sometimes that objection is being used as a cover for what is really an underlying objection in principle. The scientists say, with typical caution and care, that there is no evidence that this is unsafe. It is true that nobody can have 100% certainty about that, but there have been 15 years of research and seven years of scrutiny, including by various scientific bodies and ones promoted under this Government, and so far no one has been able to come up with a concrete and powerful objection that suggests that the process is unsafe. It is right for us today to be considering moving on to the next step.</p>

	<p pid="e.178.6/1">Let me make some progress, as others want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="e.178.6/2">Thirdly, I hear a rejection on the grounds that we are somehow rushing because we are going to be first. People ask, why us? Why now? Why in Britain? I must say, having had the privilege of serving as the Minister responsible for science, that we are first because we have world-leading research in this area. We should be proud of the fact that it is in British labs and British universities that this fundamental research is happening. It was in our country that the structure of DNA was discovered</p>
	<p pid="e.178.6/3">and I had the privilege of going to the Nobel prize ceremony for Robert Edwards, who won the Nobel prize for his work on IVF, which would properly not have passed through the levels of scrutiny we require of research today.</p>
	<p pid="e.178.6/4">That brings me to my fourth and final point. What is our role in this Chamber today, faced with this very difficult question? We must make a judgment on whether any ethical issues stand in the way of tackling a clear human need. We are not agreeing that any specific programme of treatment should be licensed or should go ahead. We are very fortunate in this country to have a regulatory structure that is different from that in the US. In the US, if Congress voted for such legislation to go ahead, that would be the end of the matter. If we vote for the regulations today, as I hope that we will, we are saying that the HFEA can decide whether or not to license specific uses of mitochondrial DNA donation after it has assessed all the risks. There is that further safeguard. All we are doing is saying we require it to make that assessment and we are not objecting in principle. My sense of the mood of this House is that there are not many people who object in principle.</p>

	<p pid="e.179.2/1">As we have heard, mitochondrial DNA makes up a tiny proportion of our total DNA. Unlike nuclear DNA, it does not pass on any personal attributes; it is purely involved in the chemistry of energy production. That is why, when there is a defect in mitochondrial DNA, it tends to affect organs that require a high amount of energy, such as the heart, muscles, brain and liver. All of our mitochondria are inherited from the egg and, as we have heard, researchers have worked on techniques to replace faulty mitochondria using those from a healthy donor. To refer to that donor as a third parent, as some have, is something of a misnomer. There are 37 genes in mitochondrial DNA, which is less than 0.01% of our total DNA. Altering the mitochondria will not alter a child&#8217;s characteristics inherited from its biological parents, but it may provide a way to prevent a debilitating and sometimes fatal disease.</p>

	<p pid="e.180.0/1">I want to pick up on the point the hon. Lady makes about mitochondria not affecting characteristics. The Government&#8217;s own consultation document acknowledged that diverse characteristics are associated with mitochondria, including learning disabilities, neurological problems and dementia, and that every person&#8217;s symptoms are different. Is there not an insurmountable contradiction in saying that this is just like changing a battery if on the one hand one is saying that the aim is to prevent damage to those characteristics, but on the other hand one is saying that the techniques will not affect them at all?</p>

	<p pid="e.180.1/1">I did not say it was just like changing a battery. In fact, I try to avoid using that terminology. The hon. Lady mentions learning disabilities, but as I just said, the organs affected the most by mitochondrial disorders are organs that require a large amount of energy, such as the brain, so that comes as no surprise to me.</p>

	<p pid="e.180.3/1">No, I will not, because I need to make progress and let other people speak.</p>
	<p pid="e.180.3/2">Last night, it was my privilege to attend the debate on the safety and ethics of this technique and to hear Professor Doug Turnbull, who leads the research team at Newcastle university, talk about the 15 years of work done by his team and the extensive safety checks that have taken place during those years. In the Chinese case to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase> referred, the treatment was carried out by an American clinician on a single patient in China. The patient became pregnant with triplets, one of whom was aborted and the other two were born prematurely and died. Importantly, the clinician attributed the outcome entirely to multiple pregnancy and obstetric complications, not to the method of conception. I do not accept that that one case represents a proper clinical trial.</p>
	<p pid="e.180.3/3">What we have to remember is that mitochondrial disease is a life-limiting debilitating disease, causing severe distress to parents and their affected children. We have here a technique with the ability to alleviate their suffering and to allow affected parents the chance to have a healthy child who is genetically related to them in all aspects apart from a tiny proportion of mitochondrial DNA. The spectre of designer babies can be dismissed. There is no possibility in using this technique of being able to select certain characteristics. It will simply allow mitochondria to function normally and for the child to be free of mitochondrial disease.</p>

	<p pid="e.180.5/1">I will not, no.</p>
	<p pid="e.180.5/2">In safety, the UK has a robust regulatory framework. A vote in favour of the motion will not in itself open the way for mitochondrial donation to be used in clinics. It will simply enable the HFEA to consider each individual family&#8217;s request for treatment on a case-by-case basis,</p>
	<p pid="e.180.5/3">taking expert scientific and medical advice and licensing the procedure only if the evidence shows that that is appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="e.180.5/4">I am lucky enough to have worked at the Royal Oldham hospital, where the first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born. When IVF was first introduced, there was no certainty that it was completely safe. Only after the first babies were born using the technique could scientists be completely reassured that their detailed research had led to the birth of healthy babies, but to this day research continues on IVF, just as more research must be done on mitochondrial transfer. That is the nature of science: it is a continuous process; it does not stand still.</p>
	<p pid="e.180.5/5">For families affected by mitochondrial disease, this research has given them new hope that they may at last have the chance to bear a healthy child of their own. Last night I heard from a woman who suffered from mitochondrial disease, which had also affected her mother. That young woman had taken a considered decision not to have her own children, for fear of passing on the condition. The opportunity to have this treatment presents her and many other women in that situation with new hope. The science is there to alleviate the suffering of affected families, and in my opinion it would be unethical to withhold this treatment. I urge the House to approve the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="e.181.0/1">Everybody who is following this debate will of course have the most profound sympathy for families who are affected by these appalling diseases, and I quite understand why so many colleagues want to vote for the regulations to lessen human suffering, but I am afraid that I will oppose the regulations. I do so on three grounds: ethics, safety and the importance of parliamentary procedure.</p>
	<p pid="e.181.0/2">On the first, ethics, I think what we are considering is a new step. It will affect the germ line. Mitochondria is inherited; it is not just another organ of the body. What is proposed is a fatal and important step. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase> asked, where do we stop? Given the nature of the human condition, these appalling diseases, sadly, will occur, but where do we stop? What further modifications will we make?</p>
	<p pid="e.181.0/3">My second ground for opposing the regulations is safety. Under European conventions and regulations and so on, we should have full clinical trials and the scientific community should be united on aspects of safety, which it is not. Unfortunately, we will be the first state in the world to authorise the technique, and in that sense, in bioethical terms, we will be in a unique position. We should ask ourselves why no other state&#8212;not in the EU, not the US, not yet anybody&#8212;thinks that this is proved to be absolutely safe.</p>
	<p pid="e.181.0/4">As for the third reason for my opposition, it has been said that this is not a final decision, and that we are just handing it over to the HFEA, but this is the final decision; it is a monumental decision. For the first time, Parliament is saying that we authorise people to affect mitochondrial DNA. That is a monumental decision. This will now happen and colleagues who vote for the regulations must appreciate that.</p>
	<p pid="e.181.0/5">For those three reasons&#8212;on ethical grounds, on safety grounds and on procedural grounds, I will vote against the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="e.182.0/1">I hold the Minister in the utmost respect, but I feel greatly aggrieved that we are discussing this matter today in the House and that the Government are pushing forward with legislation on a process that I believe is unethical and unproven.</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/2">When assessing the reports published by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, we must take into account the point that the expert panel comprises a small group of scientists convened by the HFEA. Hearing the tone of today&#8217;s debate, one could be forgiven for thinking that they represent world scientific opinion. I do not want the House to be hoodwinked into thinking that there is a consensus on this issue, because there certainly is not. In fact, numerous world-leading scientists have been at pains to express their concerns about the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/3">They include Professor David Keefe of New York university medical centre, himself a pioneer of spindle transfer techniques, who said:</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/4">&#8220;the application of the&#8230;techniques&#8230;represent intriguing advances of earlier work, but displays of technical virtuosity should not blind us to potential hazards.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/5">He explains that his research group moved away from these procedures because</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/6">&#8220;vexing concerns linger about the safety of mitochondrial replacement&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/7">He is far from alone. Stem-cell scientist Professor Paul Knoepfler is so concerned that he wrote an open letter to Parliament urging caution on the ground that rushing ahead would damage the reputation of science as a whole. He concluded:</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/8">&#8220;Overall, the UK would most likely be making an historic mistake by allowing 3-parent technology to proceed in the near future. Please wait on this critical decision for the additional information needed to make a wise choice in the long run.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/9">Clearly, we need time. Australian expert Professor Justin St John calls for more tests in non-human primates, so that we better understand the possible effects of the techniques. He says:</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/10">&#8220;As well as analysing foetal development in a non-human primate model, it is essential to analyse offspring to determine that no abnormalities appear at least during early life&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/11">None of those figures objects to the ethics of the techniques. Their objections are based purely on the science. Lest we think that they are lone voices, it must be remembered that the United States Food and Drug Administration considered the techniques last year and decided that there was not enough preclinical evidence to justify proceeding. I understand that the same body has reopened the debate and has insisted that it will be at least two yeas before it is ready to make a judgment.</p>
	<p pid="e.182.0/12">In that context, I find it extraordinary that the Government have not waited for the conclusion of the preclinical safety experiments that the HFEA said should be conducted before proceeding.</p>

The fact is that the procedures for creating children are so controversial that no other country makes legal provision for them. The Council of Europe convention on biomedicine expressly prohibited them.

	<p pid="e.183.2/2">The legal opinion of the Labour QC, Lord Brennan, seemed to suggest that the Government will not bother with clinical trials. That seems extraordinary and will come as a shock to many who spoke in favour in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2015-09-01">1 September</phrase>. My colleague, Lord Morrow, spoke to the Northern Ireland Attorney-General about the attempt of the Department of Health to argue in the response to Brennan that these regulations are not caught by the clinical trials directive, on the basis that the intention is to skip clinical trials. The Attorney-General told Lord Morrow that in his opinion the Department of Health is wrong and the regulations do indeed contradict the clinical trials directive. If the regulations go through today, they will be contradictory to international law as well. The same point was made by 44 Members of the European Parliament. I urge the House to vote against the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="e.183.3/1">Mitochondrial disease shortens lives, causes serious disability and leaves heartache in its wake. Now, thanks to the world-class research led from the university of Newcastle, we have the potential of innovation in IVF that could make a real difference for thousands of families in this country.</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/2">We have not arrived at this moment of decision in a rush. This House made provision in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 for regulations to be brought to this House</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/3">&#8220;to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/4">Since those debates there has been a lengthy process to consider the benefits, the risks, the ethical issues and public consent. All these matters should be carefully</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/5">considered. What all this work has revealed is broad public, ethical and scientific support for approving mitochondrial donation.</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/6">Clearly, safety is paramount. That is why the procedure has been scrutinised on three separate occasions by independent panels of experts. No evidence has been found to suggest that these techniques are unsafe. Are they ethical? Mitochondrial donation does not alter the essential personal characteristics or traits. It gives the gift of freedom from mitochondrial disease. It does not confer on a third person the parenthood that has been claimed in this debate. It is not about a third parent.</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/7">I have received many e-mails and letters from constituents on both sides of the argument, and I understand and respect those who have principled objections to the approach. I was struck by what the Right Rev. Dr Lee Rayfield and the Rev. Dr McCarthy said in a recent letter to <i>The Guardian</i>:</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/8">&#8220;The HFEA has made clear that even if parliament were to permit these two techniques, no licences would be issued until there was sufficient assurance from expert reviewers that mitochondrial donation is &#8216;not unsafe&#8217;&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.183.3/9">For me, that assurance&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="e.184.1/1">No, I must not. We must make progress.</p>
	<p pid="e.184.1/2">That assurance from the HFEA is important. It means that although today is an important milestone in addressing mitochondrial disease, it is not the end. I was struck by what the Church of England said in its response to the HFEA&#8217;s consultation. The Church of England is not opposed in principle to these proposals. Its opposition is not absolute. It makes it clear that it is supportive in principle. As a Christian, I take heart from that.</p>
	<p pid="e.184.1/3">For myself, I am persuaded that we make our decision today with the benefit of a thorough process, including thorough parliamentary scrutiny, and we have a robust regulatory framework. Today&#8217;s vote does not open the doors to mitochondrial donation as a matter of routine in clinics. Rather, we grant the HFEA the responsibility to consider on a case-by-case basis and weigh the expert scientific and medical advice. On every occasion safety and efficacy will be considered as a consequence of the regulations&#8212;the very concern that many hon. Members have cited as their reason for objecting to these proposals. I hope hon. Members will support them.</p>
	<p pid="e.184.1/4">The Minister was right. This is about light at the end of the tunnel for thousands of families in this country. It is about the prospect of life lived, life realised, and about the potential opportunity to live.</p>

	<p pid="e.184.4/1">We are here today to consider the regulations. The explanatory note says that the debate gives Parliament the opportunity to consider whether the new techniques are safe enough</p>
	<p pid="e.184.4/2">for use in a treatment setting. I said in a point of order at the start of the debate that I did not believe that we had had sufficient opportunity to make that decision today&#8212;sufficient opportunity, yes, to consider the passionate views of those mothers about whom we have heard today, who are at risk of passing a serious disease to their children, and also to consider on behalf of the country the prospect of our being world leaders in permitting human germ-line genetic modification. I say &#8220;genetic modification&#8221; because that is what it is. We need a clear and honest debate.</p>
	<p pid="e.184.4/3">A number of scientists have accused the Government of dishonesty for trying to redefine what we are here for today, which is to debate whether to permit genetic modification. Only last week, the United States Institute of Medicine said that what we are discussing today are</p>
	<p pid="e.184.4/4">&#8220;assisted reproductive methods involving genetic modification of eggs and zygotes for the prevention of mitochondrial disease.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.184.4/5">The HFEA, too, accepted honestly on its website that whether we go for PNT or MST, they are both genetic modification.</p>
	<p pid="e.184.4/6">I do not know how many Members have read the regulations. This is not a wide debate about mitochondrial donation or about the principle. It is specifically about the regulations. They make it clear that the procedures entail a cell nuclear transfer, which alters the nuclear DNA in the egg that the DNA is transferred into. It is clear that mitochondrial DNA makes up part of the human genetic code. This technology that we are debating modifies that code by separating nuclear mitochondrial DNA. Regulations 4 and 7 make it clear that this is a complete transfer of nuclear DNA into the donor&#8217;s egg or embryo. The Government should admit that the interaction between mitochondria and nuclear material is not clear. We cannot say with certainty that these techniques will not affect the characteristics of children.</p>
	<p pid="e.184.4/7">In conclusion, the Government said in their consultation response that this is about providing greater understanding of the ways in which mitochondrial DNA mutations are passed down from mother to child. In many ways it is an experiment, or a wider trial, and it is a trial that I do not think we should go ahead with. It is unprecedented in the world. Some might say that it is leading the pack, and others might say that it is leaving us out on a limb. Ethically, it breaks international norms. Legally, we have heard about the directive. With regard to safety, the tests are not yet complete. Members might think &#8220;Not yet&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221;. Either way, please vote against the motion.</p>

	<p pid="e.185.0/1">I will try to touch on some of the points raised in this high-quality debate, in which views have been expressed on all sides of the argument. I will deal first with the technical questions. I really cannot add to the excellent explanation that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40702" name="Liz McInnes">the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton (Liz McInnes)</phrase> gave of the Zhang et al study from China. She was precisely right and explained it very well.</p>
	<p pid="e.185.0/2">In answer to an earlier question, we are satisfied that regulations are necessary and that they are not ultra vires. The clinical trials directive is not relevant in this context. It is part of a suite of EU measures that set out</p>
	<p pid="e.185.0/3">common rules across Europe to ensure the free movement of safe medicines in the EU. Mitochondrial donation is not a medicine, so those provisions do not apply. The follow-up assessment of the treatment&#8217;s efficacy is part of good clinical practice.</p>

	<p pid="e.186.1/1">I am afraid that I cannot, because my role now is to respond to the points that have already been made.</p>
	<p pid="e.186.1/2">On international support, Britain does not stand alone, as some Members have suggested. The Department of Health has recently received a lot of correspondence from researchers and scientists in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Hong Kong and two states in Australia, all indicating support for UK advances on mitochondrial donation. It is also important to note that nobody is saying that scientists are of one voice or one mind on the issue, but the House should note that the overall weight of international scientific opinion is very much in favour of these techniques, and they have been looked at exhaustively.</p>
	<p pid="e.186.1/3">Following the point made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow)</phrase>, I have today spoken with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Carlisle, who speaks for the Church of England on ethical matters in the other place, and with the Rev. Dr Brendan McCarthy, the Church&#8217;s national adviser on medical ethics, and they have told me that I can confirm that the Church is not opposed in principle to mitochondrial donation.</p>
	<p pid="e.186.1/4">We have discussed germ-line therapy, with Members disputing definitions on genetic modification. The HFEA agrees that these techniques are germ-line therapy, but it has also agreed with the Government&#8217;s working definition that mitochondrial donation is not genetic modification; but I accept that others will have a different view, because there is no international or universally accepted definition.</p>
	<p pid="e.186.1/5">With regard to the techniques being successfully performed in non-human primates, I can confirm that maternal spindle transfer is a technique developed in the US that has been performed successfully in non-human primates. Lord Brennan&#8217;s comments on the regulations were made to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which did not draw any special attention to his remarks. In answer to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase>, the regulations will not prevent mitochondrial disease caused by faults in nuclear DNA; the techniques make no alteration to nuclear DNA.</p>
	<p pid="e.186.1/6">It is really important, in the seconds remaining, to point out for those Members who have said that we are rushing, and that it is open season on all these things, that that is not true. It is defined in primary legislation that the regulations can apply only to serious mitochondrial disease. There is no slippery slope. I looked back at the debates in the House on IVF all those years ago, when some were worried about a slippery slope, and all the safeguards are still in place more than two decades later. I think we can give the House confidence that we have considered this very carefully and that there is enough information. As I have said before, this is a bold step for Parliament to make, but it is a considered and informed one. We have world-leading science set in a well respected</p>
	<p pid="e.186.1/7">regulatory regime. For many families affected, this is indeed the light at the end of a dark tunnel. I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.190.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. We have just had a 90-minute debate during which a number of right hon. and hon. Members from across the Chamber and with different views had to rush through their speeches. We had people putting on the record views&#8212;sometimes genuinely</p>

It is also fair to emphasise that 12 Back-Bench Members representing different viewpoints were called. That is the factual answer.</p>
	<p pid="e.191.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase> invites my view as to the propriety or otherwise of this matter, and I can say only that we have operated entirely in accordance with procedure. There has been no impropriety and nothing disorderly. I understand that some people are discontented, but I hope people will not take offence if I say that to a degree, I think there will always be people who are discontented. It is difficult to get unanimity on these matters, either on the merits of the issue or on the procedure. However, I think we have done our best, and people have done their best today to help each other, which is worthy of note.</p>

	<p pid="e.191.1/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. It is obviously of great concern to many Members of the House that only 90 minutes was allocated for that debate, and you outlined at the beginning of the debate that the Minister could control that. What advice would you give to Back Benchers who want to ensure that in future, if there are debates about such enormous change for the whole United Kingdom, we can ensure a three-hour debate rather than a 90-minute debate?</p>

	<p pid="e.191.2/1">I am always happy to offer my advice to the hon. Gentleman, but whether he takes it or not is entirely up to him. The short answer is twofold. The hon. Gentleman is an assiduous attender of debates&#8212;indeed, I have often wondered if he sleeps here overnight because he is invariably present in the Chamber at all times and for every Adjournment debate. First, he should always turn up at business questions when he can raise such matters with the Leader of the House. Secondly, if he feels that Back Benchers should have a greater say in the allocation of time on matters of this kind, he might want to join forces with other hon. Members who are championing the creation of a House business committee. That was to be introduced by the third year of this Parliament, but I think it momentarily slipped the Government&#8217;s memory and therefore has not happened. It might happen in the next Parliament, however, and I have a feeling that the hon. Gentleman might be a cheerleader for it. We will leave it there.</p>

	<p pid="e.194.2/3">Whatever the pros and cons of the argument on the length of the previous debate, on which views are widely held, shared and disputed, it is entirely appropriate that we should have a three-hour debate on rural phone and broadband connectivity, which is important to many people in this country. The debate follows one in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-06">6 January</phrase>. That debate was only 30 minutes long, but the Minister and I took 11 interventions. I am delighted by the turnout of colleagues on both sides of the House in the Chamber today. I specifically thank the Backbench Business Committee for its support in allowing us this time. I pay tribute to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee for its excellent reports on rural communities, which was published last year, and on rural broadband and digital-only services, which was published just this morning.</p>
	<p pid="e.194.2/4">Before Christmas, I surveyed more than 1,100 people living and working in my constituency in Herefordshire on mobile not spots. The overwhelming majority felt that that was a serious or very serious concern to them. Local businesses feel exactly the same way. In one recent survey in Herefordshire, almost 98% of local business responded to say that they had specific problems with mobile coverage.</p>

	<p pid="e.194.3/1">My hon. Friend will appreciate that my seat is anything but rural, but the self-same problems of not spots relating to broadband connectivity affect even our biggest cities. As many will recognise from complaints by their staff, that applies even here in the Palace of Westminster in this part of SW1. I accept that this is a rural debate, but the issue affects the whole of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="e.194.4/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for making the very important point that while these are especially difficult issues in rural areas, they are not confined to them. If it is possible to have a problem with mobile connectivity in SW1, I invite him to consider what it is like in HR1.</p>
	<p pid="e.194.4/2">The issue is not merely bad mobile and broadband coverage, but the compounded effect of both, especially on isolated communities in rural areas such as my own. To take just one example, Vodafone recently acknowledged to me that it has only 55% coverage for 3G mobile data services in Herefordshire. Is it any wonder that bad connectivity is such a source of continuing frustration?</p>

	<p pid="e.195.2/1">Councillor Richard Sherras is rarely far from my thoughts. My hon. Friend&#8217;s point is illustrated perfectly by a business in Blakemere in my constituency with the wonderful name of Wiggly Wigglers. Wiggly Wigglers was set up 25 years ago in 1990 by fantastic local dynamo Heather Gorringe. It has become an award-winning example of local entrepreneurship. It began with composting worms and garden products, and has now diversified into flower delivery. It has 11 employees, nine of whom are women. It is a perfect example of the kind of higher value-added rural business that constituencies in rural areas across the country seek to emulate, but it is totally reliant on online sales. Blakemere is a village of 63 people. In Heather&#8217;s words:</p>
	<p pid="e.195.2/2">&#8220;Our other services are pretty rubbish&#8230;A bus goes by once a day, our rubbish is collected once a fortnight, our roads are full of potholes, our train services impossible.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.195.2/3">Last year, the B road was cut off for a month and one day, and her husband Phil pulled out 39 cars and other vehicles from a chest-high flood. This is the reality of rural broadband compared with other services, and their broadband service has got steadily worse over the past few years, not better.</p>

	<p pid="e.195.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for bringing this important debate to the House. He is highlighting how crucial it is for rural businesses and farmers to have good connectivity, but another important message is that good connectivity reduces the pressure on the road network, because people can work from home and not overstretch the commuter roads. The roads around Aberdeen, for example, are already overstretched.</p>

	<p pid="e.196.1/1">Characteristically, my hon. Friend is making an impassioned speech on behalf of rural communities. We are fortunate in Macclesfield in that some communities have received broadband in recent years, but we now need to get to the isolated villages&#8212;places such as Wincle, Wildboarclough and Kettleshulme.

In Kimmeridge, a remote part of South Dorset, they will be building, with lottery money, a new museum for fossils collected over 30 years by Mr Steve Etches MBE. They were promised broadband for this new, all-singing, all-dancing museum in 2016, but they have now been told that they are not going to get it. The effect on this small community is devastating.</p>

In particular, we have been told that it is not commercially viable to upgrade the Great Missenden cabinet 11 to superfast broadband. Also, Connected Counties told us that cabinet 6 in Beaconsfield would be upgraded, but although we started inquiries in the middle of last year, it is not expected to deliver until the end of this year. Surely it is terrible for people to have to wait that long.</p>

It is the failure to provide broadband and a mobile phone signal that is causing the greatest difficulties in my constituency. I hope the Minister will keep the pressure on BT. It is delaying the connections that would enable the use of other types of telephone signal in the absence of sufficient broadband width on which companies could base their rural solutions.</p>

	<p pid="e.197.0/1">My hon. Friend is right to focus on the combined effect of lack of mobile and broadband connectivity.</p>
	<p pid="e.197.0/2">It is testimony to the importance of this debate that the House is so full, especially on the Government side of the argument. I am delighted that the Minister, who is not yet the Samson Agonistes of his Department, has retained his beard for this important debate. We must pray he never loses it and, in particular, that it confers the strength required to see this vital project through to its natural conclusion&#8212;and certainly that if he does lose it, he does not lose it to the mobile operators.</p>
	<p pid="e.197.0/3">Responding to my debate on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-06">6 January</phrase>, the Minister stressed the huge investment in and the tremendous progress the Government are making on broadband and superfast broadband, and on improving mobile communications. He is absolutely right, and I pay tribute to him and the Secretary of State, but he acknowledged that there were still issues&#8212;how could there not be&#8212;with implementation, and it is on implementation that I believe this debate should focus. I shall pick three key areas of implementation.</p>
	<p pid="e.197.0/4">The first concerns partial mobile not spots, about which so many Members have spoken. I welcome the agreement recently reached between the Government and the mobile network operators, but it would be helpful to have some detail from the Minister on what specific steps he is taking to ensure that areas with multiple communications problems&#8212;of the kind highlighted by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40442" name="Bill Wiggin">the Member for North Herefordshire (Bill Wiggin)</phrase> that also exist in my constituency&#8212;can be prioritised for improved coverage.</p>
	<p pid="e.197.0/5">The Government also need to focus on the worst-hit areas and not merely allow the operators to target the easy wins. If I may, I will tentatively offer a suggestion. Perhaps the Government might consider initiating or promoting a means by which rural communities could petition their councils for mobile services as a signal of interest to the operators and as a trigger for a fast track through the planning process. We need that kind of change if we are to get adequate roll-out to some of the more remote areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.197.2/1">One can only hope, depending on his business, that once the upgrade goes through, Mr Washington will have considerably more than 2 megabits&#8212;enough to allow him not merely to run his current business, but to expand it into all kinds of other value-added areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.197.2/2">My second area of focus concerns the mobile infrastructure project. The situation, it is fair to say, has, after initially high hopes, become disappointing and frustrating. When the sites to benefit from the mobile infrastructure project were first announced in July 2013, the ambition was for them to be acquired and built this year. That has now slipped&#8212;officially, at least&#8212;to spring 2016. Ten sites were identified in Herefordshire alone, but to date only two in the country, not just in my county, have been delivered. This is a vital area for the Government to focus on.</p>
	<p pid="e.197.2/3">I very much welcomed the Minister&#8217;s announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-06">6 January</phrase> that the mobile infrastructure project masts would now run 3G and 4G antennae, which is a great step forward. He said that</p>

	<p pid="e.197.2/5">Could he be a bit more specific? What we need now is a schedule of all the sites that Arqiva plan to develop, a detailed explanation of what barriers exist to getting the plans delivered and a plan from the Department to recover costs from Arqiva if the contract can no longer be delivered.</p>

	<p pid="e.198.2/1">This concept of the last 10% and the last 5% is what worries me. There is a saying in rugby clubs nowadays that the London Irish are known as the &#8220;not nots&#8221; because they are not London and they are not Irish. We have the same things with &#8220;not nots&#8221; in the rural population: people who do not get broadband, do not get mobile phone coverage and do not get the other infrastructure. They are simply left out. It is no good saying 90% or 95% are getting it, if the last 5% are always the same people&#8212;those who are living in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.200.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on the wonderfully persuasive and erudite way in which he opened it, which makes me slightly trepidatious about following him. <i>[Interruption.] </i>That is most kind. I also congratulate the Backbench Business Committee on finding the time for us to debate this hugely important issue.</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/2">Even the urban parts of my constituency suffer economically from the geographical remoteness of our corner of Cumbria. My constituency includes small villages and one of the Lake district&#8217;s most remote valleys, which all Members should take the time to discover&#8212;not, perhaps, before <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-07">7 May</phrase>, but at any time after that. Good-quality broadband connections are vital for local businesses trying to compete with those in more densely populated areas, for our sizeable tourist industry trying to make the most of our stunningly beautiful area, and of course simply for local residents who want to use the web at something better than the prehistoric speeds that so many of them have to cope with.</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/3">Over the last two summer recesses I travelled around my constituency by bike, sitting down with local residents in front rooms, village halls and cafes to talk about whatever issues mattered to them, and time and again&#8212;whether in Broughton, Kirkby, Leece or Great Urswick&#8212;the issue of broadband speeds came up. Many residents knew they had been promised great things by the Government in terms of rural broadband but had not seen the fruits of that.</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/4">Ministers have certainly talked the talk over recent years and some parts of my constituency are getting broadband which is much better, even if they believe, rightly, that the description &#8220;superfast&#8221; is overegging the pudding, but for too many other areas the reality on the ground simply has not changed. There is no great use in our revisiting here the fiasco of the bidding process for rural broadband, but the delays that led to it are still dragging on, leaving thousands of my constituents relying on broadband speeds of barely 1 megabit per second. In the village of Ireleth alone, 500 households are struggling along on that sort of speed. Hundreds of others in neighbouring villages are seeing similar glacial broadband speeds. The residents, as well as myself, are becoming increasingly sceptical about BT&#8217;s promises&#8212;the</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/5">hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire eloquently made this point&#8212;to upgrade the local exchanges and ensure these villages get the 21st century service they deserve and need.</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/6">Let me give my own experience to demonstrate this point. On <phrase class="date" code="2015-10-14">14 October</phrase> last year my office received an e-mail from BT stating that the exchanges at Broughton-in-Furness and Greenodd, which serve most of the rural areas of my constituency, would be upgraded during the winter of that year. That was excellent news, but then, after Christmas, another constituent from the area contacted me about their very slow broadband. I wrote to BT again. On <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-21">21 January</phrase>, just three months after I was told something quite to the contrary, BT responded that</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/7">&#8220;there is no date available by when this will be ready.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.200.1/8">BT understood, the e-mail went on to say, that its supplier, Openreach, had met its target of delivering fibre optics to two thirds of the UK and that anything further would be a matter for funding by the Government&#8217;s broadband fund. This is another example of it washing its hands of this situation and the clear responsibility of providing acceptable broadband speeds for my constituents.</p>

	<p pid="e.202.6/1">The hon. Member makes a great point&#8212;the situation is a nightmare. As I have just set out, often when someone receives assurances, they prove not to hold water. BT is a company that we would think would be good at communicating, but it turns out that for too many of our constituents, who are really tearing their hair out about this issue, BT has proved to be the exact opposite.</p>
	<p pid="e.202.6/2">That has got to change, and either BT changes its ways itself&#8212;in response to the threat of other companies coming in&#8212;or, if I might offer the Minister some advice, the Government embrace the idea that they need to be more active in this sector. They had a tremendous example of a lean, active state, which was provided by the latter years of the last Labour Government, and this is an excellent opportunity for them to learn from those years and adopt the same approach in their own dealings.</p>
	<p pid="e.202.6/3">I turn to mobile connectivity. In the Duddon valley, if someone gets one bar of reception, they count themselves lucky. Again, this situation makes running a business tricky, or completely impossible, because it cuts off communities and in a remote area it also has serious safety implications. It is perhaps odd to think of mobile coverage as the next frontier after superfast broadband, but there has been little apparent interest from commercial companies in improving coverage for much of my constituency, and I am sure that the same is true of many other Members&#8217; constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.202.6/4">Any movement on this issue is welcome, but with the greatest of respect to Shropshire, Dorset and Norfolk, pilot schemes in those areas do not mean much to my</p>
	<p pid="e.202.6/5">constituents in Cumbria or impress them very much, if at all. Many of my constituents also look askance at the Government plans to improve rural mobile coverage based on A roads and B roads. My constituents in Seathwaite, for example, are 3 miles from the nearest such road, hidden behind a 2,000 foot hill, so such plans are not likely to help them much. We need more ambition, not a brief flurry of activity because the Prime Minister could not get any mobile reception on his way to Cornwall.</p>

	<p pid="e.203.1/1">May I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that perhaps the way to get a quick solution would be to get a visit from the Prime Minister, a big fan of his, to his patch. It seemed to trigger the promise of action, if not the reality of it, when the Prime Minister was on his way to Cornwall. One never knows what could happen.</p>
	<p pid="e.203.1/2">For too many of my constituents, no mobile reception and super-slow broadband are not just a holiday inconvenience; they are a fact of everyday life that impoverishes them and holds them back from reaching the enormous economic potential that my region has. Let me make one final request of the Minister, as he was so kind in agreeing immediately to my first one. Will he come to the beautiful Duddon valley&#8212;he had better come quick, given the election on <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-07">7 May</phrase>&#8212;in my constituency? When he has finished admiring the scenery, will he try to do some work there for 24 hours, without meaningful broadband and with no mobile reception? Perhaps then&#8212;if he can properly appreciate how difficult it is to get anything done there&#8212;we will see some quicker action to tackle the mobile and broadband deserts afflicting too many in my patch.</p>

Needless to say, many villages in Shropshire are facing similar problems. Let me highlight the village of Pontesbury, the largest village in my constituency. As Members of Parliament are inviting the Minister to go all over the UK, let me invite him to the village of Pontesbury, an important and large village just to the south of Shrewsbury, where it is extremely difficult to get any mobile phone coverage. We have mentioned local businesses, schools and children needing to do homework and other things on computers, and this problem really is holding this village back significantly. So I am pleased to hear about the progress the Government are making.</p>

	<p pid="e.204.0/1">I will thank the Minister for that. Given what he has said, I will bring Pontesbury parish councillors to meet him here in the House of Commons before the general election, and I thank him for accepting.</p>
	<p pid="e.204.0/2">Let me make a brief point about the local enterprise partnership, about which I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire. I believe passionately that the LEP is there to bring Government money in to help with major infrastructure projects&#8212;projects that are going to create businesses, jobs and prosperity for the areas they cover. At the request of our council, a considerable amount of money from the LEP is now having to be put towards improving such services in Shropshire. That is clearly taking money away from something that I feel passionate about and that I wish to raise money for, which is the university of Shrewsbury. That money should not come from the LEP. As we are talking about a fundamental right of all our citizens, the money should come directly from the Government. We should not have to differentiate between the projects in the LEP.</p>
	<p pid="e.204.0/3">I pay tribute to the leader of Shropshire council, Mr Keith Barrow, who has campaigned tirelessly on the need for the Government to provide more funding and resources for broadband and mobile phone coverage in Shropshire. I look forward to meeting the Minister with the parishioners of Pontesbury and I hope that we can make progress on this issue in the months ahead.</p>

	<p pid="e.204.5/2">As people, many of our needs have been met. We have food, drink, clothing and communication. In our houses, we have electricity, water and insulation, but we need communication and connectivity. That connectivity happens thanks to broadband&#8212;hopefully, it is 4G and mobile connectivity. The point was well made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase> who talked about &#8220;not not spots&#8221;. Let us ensure that we get &#8220;have have&#8221; spots, because that is what we need. This connectivity is a natural need, and it is what many people want and expect. The expectation that that connectivity will be in place is growing. People are comparing the situation in their own areas not only with other places in their own countries but with other countries, particularly rural places in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.204.5/3">Our aim is to have superfast broadband and 4G reaching 98% of the population, which should mean that connectivity is well distributed across the country and that we do not have places in the UK where broadband coverage is far below 98% of the population. If 95% of us have superfast broadband, then surely 100% of us should get normal broadband. If superfast broadband has speeds of up to 30 megabits or more, surely others can reach 2, 4, 6 or 8 megabits.</p>
	<p pid="e.204.5/4">There is also a possibility of convergence with 4G, as 4G is primarily a data carrier with speeds of up to 30 megabits. It does not matter whether or not people are connected with fibre, because connectivity can be found to enable them to get on the web thanks to the speed of the new mobile communications.</p>

	<p pid="e.205.1/1">I see the Minister nodding. I am glad that he is in agreement with me. Connectivity is a social necessity and a business requirement. Young people definitely expect it in rural areas. If we want to keep young people in those areas, we should ensure that they have proper coverage.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/2">Recent lightning strikes in the outer Hebrides and the Na h-Eileanan an Iar constituency knocked out the British Telecom lines for a period of time. I came across hard-working BT engineers in ditches, fields and on roadsides, looking to find the faults for individual houses and knowing that the fault could lie in any one of four possibilities. They worked hard and did their best to get the lines up and running. Meanwhile, people have been in more than a not not spot. In fact, they have found themselves in a not not not spot&#8212;to extend the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/3">Mobile telecommunications are a social utility; they are really necessary for people. We are no longer talking about having them for lighter reasons. People, including pensioners, need the links to make contact with the outside world. Mobile telecommunications are particularly important in places that are far removed from major centres of health care. People who have heart attacks can be diagnosed or have measurements taken from them and then the details can be sent to a specialist who can then advise them on their treatment. I am talking about a life-saving potential, which I know that the Minister recognises.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/4">My fear is that the UK has been left behind in its treatment of rural and island areas. Island areas with the best coverage include the Isle of Man and the Faroe Islands, which control their own mobile and broadband communications. In many ways, the UK has failed in this regard, as 2G is patchy at best, and 3G is patchy if existent at all. Surely, this will not happen with 4G as well. In the Faroe Islands, for 50,000 people there are about 50 3G masts. We look at that with envy in the highlands of Scotland. With a femtocell system, they can reach fishermen 100 km off land on mobile phones on their boats. Although mobile phones do not have that range, they have developed the technology to do that.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/5">In places such as the Faroe Islands there can be a signal in the undersea tunnels between their islands. In stark contrast, people who travel into London cannot</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/6">use their mobile phone on the Gatwick Express as they go through tunnels. That is an indictment of the treatment of mobile telephony in the UK. I happened to be on the train with a Norwegian the other day and he could not believe that his mobile phone would not work in the tunnels. There is a really bad signal and that is almost the benchmark of what has been happening.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/7">Roaming, or the lack of it, is definitely a problem. I think the model of not enabling roaming has been wrong, because sometimes, particularly in rural areas, there is a mobile telephone network available, but only one. People end up having to carry two mobile telephones and if they know the local area well they will know roughly which one they can use to get a signal. At this point, I praise Vodafone, which has been very good at providing a community Openreach system. I have managed to secure it in a couple of places in my constituency and hope to get it in more. It piggybacks the broadband network to give people a much-wanted mobile phone signal.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/8">We must listen when providers say that they could provide a better signal if they were allowed masts that were a little higher. I am not coming down on either side of that argument, as it might be a contentious issue and we will have to wait and see what people say, but we must bear it in mind. Mobile phone companies say that they could give us better coverage if they had higher masts.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/9">Companies also have problems with the bottlenecks of transmitters and masts. Sometimes, unreasonable rents are asked of a second mobile phone company that wants to use an existing mast, because of the basic greed of some companies. That is choking the life and expectations of many communities. The problem also affects tourism, as people go on holiday and are unable to use their mobile phones. That is a point of frustration. If they did not want to use their telephones, they would of course switch them off.</p>
	<p pid="e.205.1/10">There have been many pleas to the Minister to visit constituencies, but I would like to lighten his work load. I am not inviting him to my constituency&#8212;now there is a disappointed face. If he wants to come to Na h-Eileanan an Iar to see our beautiful scenery, he is of course welcome. My political point, which I think would help him, is that he should devolve much of these things to the Scottish Government, who could then control it all.</p>

	<p pid="e.206.1/1">I am afraid that I meant both mobile and broadband. The Minister is right that the Scottish Government have done a great job and he gives me a tremendous opportunity to tell him just how well they have done. While the UK Government provided &#163;100.8 million through BDUK, &#163;410 million is being spent on the Digital Scotland superfast broadband programme. For that, great thanks should go to the Scottish Government, who know full well and understand the situation.</p>

	<p pid="e.206.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is fiddling the figures. The total might be &#163;400 million, but well over &#163;100 million of that came from the UK Government and well over &#163;100 million</p>
	<p pid="e.206.2/2">from BT. The Scottish Government put something in, but delivery by the Scottish Government and BT is hopeless. It is high time that the hon. Gentleman got on to the Scottish Government and told them to deliver broadband to my constituency with the money they have.</p>

	<p pid="e.207.0/1">I see that the hon. Gentleman is criticising British Telecom&#8212;I am not sure whether he is calling for a Scottish Telecom. When he spoke on this issue in the middle of last month, he did not allude to the fact that there was &#163;400 million. He said that only &#163;120 million was being spent and did not give the full picture at all. He will, of course, be delighted to know that a 4G pilot project is coming to the island of Coll, which I am very pleased and excited to hear about. Surely he should be welcoming the progress we have seen and the laying of fibre cables to 19 remote islands, including some of my own. I am pleased to see that and I hope that it will expand. If the Scottish Government were not involved and only his own Government were, we would not have seen that at all and we would have been in a parlous state. The hon. Gentleman would do well to remember just what the Scottish Government have done. Just today, we have the news of the improved services going live in Orkney and Shetland&#8212;not my islands or his, but we celebrate that that is coming. I particularly celebrate that the service is on the way to Stornaway as well, where 5,000 premises in the Hebrides will be connected to superfast broadband for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="e.207.0/2">Our next step is to expand throughout all the islands, in the rural areas of each island, and to make sure that everyone benefits, because we do not want a situation where we have the not not not spots. Lack of broadband access is a social blight and a business blight, which of course leads to an economic blight. We need the same connectivity not just as the cities of the UK but as the rural areas of the Nordic countries.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> for initiating this debate and the interest he has taken in the subject, which concerns a large number of us who represent rural constituencies and who believe that access to broadband is now essential, not a luxury. Despite its relative proximity to London, I had in my constituency two of the country&#8217;s four not spots. Even though the villages are just 50 miles from London, broadband was not available at all. The latest House of Commons figures suggest that only 52% of my constituency has superfast broadband access, making it one of the worst for broadband coverage. Many of my right hon. and hon. Friends who represent rural constituencies will be familiar with that situation.</p>

	<p pid="e.207.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree with me that we must not forget the plight of farmers, who now have to apply online for their money from the EU? Between 10% and 15% of farmers do not have the capability to do so, which will have a serious impact on their livelihoods.</p>

	<p pid="e.207.3/1">I strongly agree. That is a good example of why access to broadband is no longer a luxury but a necessity, particularly when people such as farmers are required to file information in that way.</p>
	<p pid="e.207.3/2">Three and a half years ago, I held a summit in conjunction with West Sussex county council. The then Culture Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40561" name="Jeremy Hunt">the Member for South West Surrey (Mr Hunt)</phrase>, attended and we had a good meeting to discuss how to improve the situation. Following that, the Government announced their programme to extend broadband access across the country and West Sussex county council announced its Better Connected programme. With &#163;6 million-worth of central Government support, which was matched by the county council, the programme will fulfil the Government&#8217;s ambition to ensure that 95% of the county has access to superfast broadband and the whole county has broadband coverage by 2017.</p>
	<p pid="e.207.3/3">I welcome the Government&#8217;s support and commitment. I recognise what they have done to make improvements, but we have to look ahead and test whether what is being done will be sufficient to ensure access for those in rural areas who will not benefit from the programme. The Rural West Sussex Partnership, which is a branch of the local enterprise partnership, Coast to Capital, has suggested that in fact the coverage delivered by the programme will not be 95%, but could be 90% or even as little as 85%. Even if 95% coverage were to be achieved, there would still be the matter of the 5% of people who did not have access to superfast broadband. They are often the people who do not have access to mobile phone coverage, either, and are therefore effectively disconnected.</p>
	<p pid="e.207.3/4">I know of the strong interest taken by my hon. Friend the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, who met me recently to discuss these issues. I was grateful to him for the interest that he showed and for listening to the concerns that I set out. I have a few observations which I hope he will not mind my repeating to the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.207.3/5">First, as other hon. Members have pointed out, there is a problematic lack of competition in the sector. That is one of the reasons why we are not seeing the necessary roll-out, an effective roll-out or sufficient customer service. There was a problem in the initial contracts which were awarded by BDUK because, although there were originally two bidders, one&#8212;Fujitsu&#8212;dropped out. We ended up, therefore, with one bidder for the contract, BT. So there is an effective monopoly and that is unsatisfactory. That is not the Government&#8217;s fault; it is simply the reality.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-02-03e.208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="208"  time="016:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150203/debtext/150203-0003.htm#150203-0003.htm_spnew74">
	<p pid="e.208.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. We need greater competition because that would deliver results faster for everybody. However, I query his last comment. With 44 small tenders, it was remarkably difficult for anybody to presume that they might gain more than one, other than BT. My worry is that the way the tender process was set up created the monopoly in the first place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-02-03e.208.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047" speakername="Nick Herbert" colnum="208"  time="016:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150203/debtext/150203-0003.htm#150203-0003.htm_spnew75">
	<p pid="e.208.1/1">I am not sure whether that is the case, but we can look ahead at how we can inject more competition into the sector to ensure the competitive pressures needed to improve customer service. I would look again, as hon. Members have suggested, at BT&#8217;s relationship with Openreach and see whether there is a case for splitting them, injecting more competition there and potentially breaking up Openreach. We need more competition in this sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.208.1/2">Secondly, we should not be fixated on the fibre-based solution, which will never be realistic in the hardest-to-reach rural areas. In those areas, wireless technology or access to 4G or faster mobile data signals will become the solution. I do not believe that satellite will be the solution. We therefore need to ensure that the kind of solutions being advanced in public-private partnership recognise that different solutions will be necessary in rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="e.209.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend, like me, welcome the &#163;10 million fund that the Government have created to develop new technologies? Does he, like me, hope that the Government might be able to go further to make sure that small companies, such as those in my constituency, can be supported to develop the technology, show proof of concept and thus challenge BT and deliver for rural communities?</p>

	<p pid="e.209.1/1">Indeed. Like my hon. Friend, I welcome the Government&#8217;s funding initiative in this area. I had intended to go on to say that. None of what I say is a criticism of the Government; they are merely suggestions as to how we can improve the situation further.</p>
	<p pid="e.209.1/2">Thirdly, we need to ensure that the technologies adopted are future-proof. There is a danger that in seeking to meet the commitment to wholesale coverage by 2017 or superfast coverage for 95%, technologies are adopted that will not stand the test of time and will quickly be found to be insufficient.</p>
	<p pid="e.209.1/3">Fourthly, I have a general observation to make about subsidy. Given that we all agree that access to broadband is an essential public service, there is a role for public subsidy in this area. That role should be to correct instances of market failure. We need to be careful to ensure that subsidy is not directed at companies or providers where the market would provide a service. With the current BDUK roll-out, there is a danger that public money is being used to close the gap in areas where it would have provided the service anyway, and the remaining 5% or 10% is not being covered. We must ensure that in future subsidy is directed to the hardest-to-reach areas and that the market is left to fill the gaps. That is a hard judgment to make, given that we are trying to ensure that the market operates properly.</p>
	<p pid="e.209.1/4">In my constituency villages are being connected one by one. There is a tremendous improvement, which reflects the initiative of the Government and the country council. I welcome that, but I suspect that many of those villages would have been connected anyway to fibre. What is happening is that the rural areas are being left out. I remind the House that these rural areas comprise a great number of people and rural businesses who need to be connected. There is the danger of a growing digital divide, which might in turn become a further manifestation of something we need to avoid: a rural-urban divide. We see that in many other aspects of policy, and I think that we should strive to prevent it.</p>
	<p pid="e.209.1/5">I mentioned that three and a half years ago I convened a summit to discuss how to improve the situation in West Sussex, and I believe that it bore fruit. I therefore suggest holding another similar event in West Sussex, not to criticise but to look forward and see how we can close the gap and ensure that we do not have a digital</p>
	<p pid="e.209.1/6">divide in rural West Sussex in future. I would be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State considered attending the summit, partly because of the lessons I think there would be for other rural areas. The summit would have the active support of the South Downs National Park Authority, for instance, which is very interested in the issue. The Government have done a great deal to improve the situation. We must now ensure that we go further and close the digital divide.</p>

	<p pid="e.210.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> and to the Backbench Business Committee for securing this important debate. I often think there is a problem with people in rural areas being told to modernise and &#8220;get with the times&#8221; while being provided with none of the infrastructure or capacity needed to do so. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" name="Anne McIntosh">the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase> and of which I am a member, only this morning published our report on rural broadband and digital-only services, following closely behind the National Audit Office&#8217;s recent report. I will focus my remarks on the deficiencies in rural broadband provision and the impact on local business, farming communities and economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="e.210.0/2">Members will be aware that responsibility for the roll-out of broadband access is devolved, with funding, to the devolved Administrations, as the Secretary of State noted in answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40413" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil)</phrase>. However, we in Northern Ireland face many of the same problems, and unfortunately many of the same deficiencies, with the Government&#8217;s approach to tackling rural connectivity, because communications and connectivity are central components of this and have to be resolved. In common with others across the UK, we face the issues associated with there being only one service provider&#8212;BT.</p>
	<p pid="e.210.0/3">As phase 1 of the rural broadband project is rolled out, in parallel with the Government&#8217;s &#8220;digital by default&#8221; strategy, we must urgently take stock of the process and act to correct failings in subsequent phases. &#8220;Digital by default&#8221; should not become &#8220;digital by diktat&#8221;, especially in cases where the support is simply not there. At the moment, &#8220;digital by default&#8221; is proceeding at a pace that the broadband connectivity strategy is struggling to keep up with.</p>
	<p pid="e.210.0/4">A central criticism made in the Select Committee&#8217;s report is that current efforts to bring rural communities up to speed with basic broadband access fall short of the EU&#8217;s Europe 2020 target of having superfast broadband&#8212;30 Mb&#8212;for all by 2020, and the universal service commitment target of 2 Mb already looks out of step with consumer and business needs, even though, sadly, it probably will not be met.</p>

	<p pid="e.211.0/1">Does the hon. Lady accept that some areas in Northern Ireland are enjoying superfast broadband, but rural communities seem to lack it, and certain areas have very little broadband, with families, as well as local businesses, suffering as a result?</p>

	<p pid="e.211.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention. I agree. The conurbations of Belfast and Derry have benefited from superfast broadband, but we who represent rural communities have not seen the best impact of that innovation. In my constituency, I have not spots and also the impact of a mountainous region. That topography limits the accessibility of people trying to get on to superfast broadband.</p>
	<p pid="e.211.1/2">Priority needs to be given to business centres in rural communities. In my area, a business centre was approved by Invest Northern Ireland and given planning permission by our local planning authority some years ago. It has a box for broadband connectivity that is not even enabled, and that will not happen until next year. How on earth do Government, in UK national terms or in devolved regions, expect a local economy to grow and develop and to provide for its citizens, whether they are ordinary rural dwellers or those who undertake farming enterprises, unless they have total access to broadband? That issue needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="e.211.1/3">From an infrastructure point of view, copper wires, which deliver basic broadband, will have to be replaced by optic fibres to deliver superfast broadband within a matter of years. As optic fibres are significantly cheaper, it makes no sense that intense efforts are being made to offer rural communities a mediocre broadband service that is already considered outdated at a time when urban areas are already receiving upgrades to superfast broadband.</p>
	<p pid="e.211.1/4">Only this week, the Federal Communications Commission in the United States approved a new definition of what constitutes a broadband service, dramatically increasing the required minimum speeds from the current standard. Other countries recognise the importance of rural access to broadband, and if the UK does not, consumers and business will be left behind. The FCC has suggested that 25 Mb should be the new standard speed. If that is the case, we will definitely be left behind.</p>
	<p pid="e.211.1/5">We are very much at risk of opening up a digital divide and a digital deficit between those with high speed and those without. This affects not only individuals but businesses in local areas. How can they be expected to compete without fair access to the same opportunities offered by new technology? In the EFRA Committee report, we suggest introducing subsidies such as vouchers. We also recommend investigating alternative technologies. That is being explored by the Government, and I hope that it comes to fruition. I urge the Secretary of State to give careful consideration to our report, on which the Government are expected to report anyway. Some very useful recommendations are contained therein which could assist the Government in working with BT and influencing it to carry out full implementation for the sake of farmers, rural communities and those engaged in rural businesses.</p>

	<p pid="e.212.0/2">North Yorkshire was one of four pilot areas that won a Government commitment in 2010 to push forward with superfast broadband in rural areas. To counter the comments of the jumping jack shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>, the whole idea of the project was that it should be driven by communities and not top down from London, and that approach has worked to great effect in North Yorkshire. The group of MPs, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40683" name="Julian Sturdy">the Member for York Outer (Julian Sturdy)</phrase>, the council and local politicians have all driven Superfast North Yorkshire, which is now delivering to 86% of the most rural county in England, and that figure will rise to 90% over the next year.</p>
	<p pid="e.212.0/3">Our contract was different from the Broadband Delivery UK contract. It was a specific contract with, ultimately, BT, but it was very competitive: there was full competition and transparency and BT won it at the end of the day. I pay tribute to those working locally, including John Moore, the chief executive of NYnet&#8212;the broadband body of North Yorkshire county council&#8212;who will retire in the next couple of months, and my predecessor John Watson, who has chaired that body. The contract has some great innovations. BT will pay back money to the council as part of it, if demand and usage are adequate. BT is also committed fully to a minimum of 2 Mb for all areas of North Yorkshire, whatever happens, and we will hold it to that commitment.</p>
	<p pid="e.212.0/4">Farms and hard-to-reach areas in the most rural communities of Skipton and Ripon and North Yorkshire face huge challenges, and I agree with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> that they will be solved only through wireless and innovative technologies. The cost of delivering through BT could be up to &#163;1,500 per house and it is only innovation that will get us there.</p>

	<p pid="e.213.0/1">Absolutely. That is a well-made point. This is not just about the Government&#8217;s responsibilities; people are taking responsibility themselves. The B4RN project&#8212;Broadband for the Rural North&#8212;split between Lancashire and Yorkshire has sought out all of the disused wires and cables to make the most of the opportunities to deliver superfast broadband.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.0/2">We have not yet discussed the issue of demand, demand stimulation and how much superfast broadband is being used by our communities. On average, the figure is 18% to 20%, and in North Yorkshire it is about 20% to 25%, but we need to get those numbers up. The Opposition criticised the Government for an ad campaign over Christmas, but they were absolutely right to spend that money. What is the point of all the pipework and infrastructure if they are not going to spend money to encourage people to use it?</p>

	<p pid="e.213.2/3">We have talked about Openreach, and I concur with all the comments made. We are generally happy with BT in North Yorkshire, but there have been major service and data issues. We have tried to get information from particular boxes so that we can work out where we can improve and get more demand&#8212;again, the Minister has been helpful in knocking heads together. The issue of fibre to the node is providing opportunities to get deeper into rural areas, although BT has dragged its feet on that.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.2/4">Ultimately, the infrastructure of the fourth national utility is managed as a subsidiary to the overarching board of a global successful corporation. Is that the right structure going forward? In football rights versus infrastructure I think football rights will always probably win, and we must have a real think. Ofcom started that in the past few weeks, and we must think over the coming years, with a Conservative-led, competition-driven Government, about how Ofcom is structured for the future.</p>

	<p pid="e.213.3/1">I refer hon. Members to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.3/2">I represent a rural constituency that is in the teeth of the superfast broadband roll-out, and is also the home of Vodafone. Twenty-five years ago, the first call was made from Newbury. The office contained 12 people and was above a curry house at the top of the high street. Vodafone is now one of Europe&#8217;s most successful companies. I do not stand here as the voice of Vodafone,</p>
	<p pid="e.213.3/3">but it is worth pointing out that the technologies developed through the inspirational leadership of people such as Sir Ernest Harrison are remarkable.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.3/4">I was in Africa not long ago seeing the M-Pesa project, which is responsible for about a quarter of the financial transactions. It has completely changed the social dynamic and the ability of people who work in distant places to send money. It is remarkable. In this country Vodafone has developed a system for supporting people who are victims&#8212;or potential victims&#8212;of domestic violence through an alert system, and it deserves credit for much of what it has achieved.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.3/5">West Berkshire has a rural population that is involved in two of the most dangerous professions: agriculture and the horse racing industry around the Lambourn valley. Getting good mobile phone coverage is not just a matter of convenience or of jobs and employment, but can be something that saves lives. The roll-out of the mobile infrastructure project is dear to our hearts in that area, and I would welcome an update from the Minister on how the project is going.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.3/6">I welcome the Government&#8217;s effort to solve the problem through a legally binding agreement with the four networks that will see &#163;5 billion invested in the UK&#8217;s mobile infrastructure. The results need to be visible as soon as possible so that constituents in areas such as mine can maximise their businesses, and people who live in rural downland villages in west Berkshire can fully partake in the dynamic Thames valley economy.</p>
	<p pid="e.213.3/7">I am interested in the report produced by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, and I hope that we can hold the feet of the various delivery agencies and companies to the fire, and ensure that we deliver on some of the dates. The Government&#8217;s original objective of rolling out superfast broadband to cover 90% of premises by 2015 has been altered to 95% of premises by 2017. BT has said that it is there or thereabouts, but that it might end up being achieved in 2018. I hope the Minister will ensure that such comments are challenged. Chris Townsend of Broadband Delivery UK has stated that he is &#8220;absolutely committed&#8221; to finalising the last 5% by 2020 at the very latest, and if that is accurate I hope we try to speed it up.</p>

	<p pid="e.214.0/1">This is one of the problems. BDUK seems to be putting back the start date for many schemes. The village of Upottery near Honiton does not know whether it will get superfast broadband in 2016, 2017 or 2018. BDUK has been given money to get to the hardest-hit areas, but it is not getting there on time. I hope the Minister will keep up the pressure on BDUK to deliver.</p>

	<p pid="e.214.2/1">Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, Dunton in my constituency was expecting to have its broadband confirmed, but it has been delayed yet again.

	<p pid="e.215.0/2">I had the pleasure of being the Minister responsible for national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. Nobody feels more strongly about landscape than I do, but our planning policy is still restrictive. There is a phrase that I find myself using too much in politics: &#8220;The squeaky door gets the oil.&#8221; Often, when there is a proposal by a mobile phone company to put up or raise a mast to achieve more coverage, there is a lot of noise from a small number of people. The silent majority who just want a better mobile phone signal are not heard. It is important that we listen to the silent majority.</p>

	<p pid="e.215.2/1">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I will not because other hon. Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="e.215.2/2">At least two mobile phone masts in my constituency are designed as pine trees. I am not a great fan of pine trees and the masts do not look like pine trees to me, but they work perfectly. That is a solution for those who believe landscapes will be abused by the presence of masts. I urge mobile phone companies to develop more fake pine trees of that nature.</p>
	<p pid="e.215.2/3">Regulations on renting land for masts and on repairing and upgrading those masts have not been meaningfully updated since 1984. The industry suffers from much higher rents. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase> made a good point about urban mobile phone signals, and that is one of the reasons for his problem. In Madrid, there are two thirds or at least half as many more masts than there are in London, one of the most important cities in the world. We can understand why his constituents are frustrated. My question&#8212;it is perhaps more philosophical than asking for views from the Front Benchers about the election&#8212;is on whether we should be looking at mobile phone delivery much more as a utility. My fellow members of the Country Landowners Association might not thank me for saying this, but it could be an opportunity, because that might dictate a different type of rent.</p>
	<p pid="e.215.2/4">The electronics communication code needs amending, and amendments to the Infrastructure Bill tabled to introduce the new code were withdrawn. I hope the Minister updates us on the code.</p>
	<p pid="e.215.2/5">I want to draw hon. Members&#8217; attention to a remarkable Vodafone project in west Berkshire, in the village of East Garston up in the Lambourn valley. I hosted an event and I am really pleased the Minister came and made an excellent speech. There are pilots around the country and that was an opportunity for him to show off his new beard, which we all welcome. In rural locations, networks can struggle to deliver coverage by traditional means, but it can be done through small technologies. In that case, a community of 450 people in a not spot have been provided with a signal from a church steeple. The Vodafone project was delivered not through a top-down statist approach, but through a local provider working with a community. It was a joy to see the first of those Vodafone pilots. It is now one of 100 schemes throughout the country. We have heard of a similar scheme in north Norfolk that has transformed the tourist potential of the area. That is a key area of delivery for the tourist industry.</p>
	<p pid="e.215.2/6">I would love to spend more time talking about broadband connectivity. We in west Berkshire look forward to ensuring that 95% of Berkshire is covered by 2017. Our focus is now on the final 5%. I believe my local authority will make an announcement in the next few days which will be welcomed by a great many people, and that we will see benefits delivered. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase> that the last 5% will always be the most difficult&#8212;on any subject. We must focus not just on being rigorous in one technology but across the piece. We must be flexible and local in how we deliver this. The Opposition suggest a centralised approach that we know has failed in the past. The Government have put in place an approach that works with communities.</p>

	<p pid="e.216.2/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> for so ably introducing the debate and the Backbench Business Committee for the opportunity to raise the hopeless performance of telephone companies in Argyll and Bute.</p>
	<p pid="e.216.2/2">In the past two months, telephone companies, both landline and mobile, have failed miserably to keep many of my constituents in telephone contact with the rest of the world. Following a storm in early December, some constituents are still waiting for their landline service to be repaired. The experience of one constituent from south Kintyre is typical. He reported a fault in December. BT made an appointment for an engineer to visit on <phrase class="date" code="2015-12-28">28 December</phrase>. That appointment was not kept. It was the same on 14 and <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-28">28 January</phrase>. He is still waiting. He now has another appointment for this Thursday. I hope that this time the engineer will turn up and fix the fault.</p>
	<p pid="e.216.2/3">BT&#8217;s excuse is that it has declared MBORC, which stands for &#8220;matters beyond our reasonable control&#8221;. It claims that owing to exceptional circumstances, it is unable to meet its normal commitment times to provide a service or repair faults. It seems that by declaring MBORC, BT can also get away with not turning up for appointments. This is totally unacceptable. The engineers are clearly working flat out, often in difficult weather conditions, but BT clearly does not have enough engineers operating in Argyll and Bute.</p>

	<p pid="e.216.4/1">My hon. Friend is correct. We all knew for months, if not years, in advance that NATO was meeting in south Wales. His comments clearly indicate that BT looks for excuses to declare MBORC.</p>
	<p pid="e.216.4/2">As several hon. Members have mentioned, BT Openreach is in the privileged position of having a monopoly on landlines. It should not be able to dodge its responsibilities</p>
	<p pid="e.216.4/3">for months simply by declaring MBORC. Will the Minister look at the regulations again?</p>
	<p pid="e.216.4/4">The universal service obligation is supposed to guarantee a landline service no matter where one lives, and my constituents are quite rightly fed up being told that if they lived in Glasgow their phone line would be repaired quickly, but that they will have to wait months because they live in a rural area. I hope the Minister will look at the regulations again. Heavy fines need to be levied for failure to repair faults in a reasonable time and for not turning up to appointments. If BT was faced with heavy fines, it would compel it to employ enough engineers.</p>

	<p pid="e.217.0/1">It also transpires that Openreach pays compensation to service providers, but not all service providers necessarily pass that compensation on to the end user. Perhaps if there was more of a compensation culture the management would be more efficient about maximising repairs.</p>

	<p pid="e.217.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. Fines are necessary to encourage companies to carry out their responsibilities properly, and not just use the cop-out of declaring MBORC.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/2">On mobile phones&#8212;the problem is not just with landlines&#8212;Vodafone cannot escape criticism either. Its performance in carrying out repairs has been poor. For example, last summer it took 18 days to repair a fault on the isle of Islay, and another fault on Islay in December took even longer to repair. These are not isolated cases. There is now yet another fault on Islay that is taking ages to repair, and there have been several instances in other parts of Argyll and Bute of long delays. When challenged, Vodafone dodged responsibility by blaming the many other companies involved in tracking down and repairing faults.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/3">A mobile phone service is not a luxury these days, but a necessity&#8212;for example, if someone&#8217;s car breaks down on a quiet country road or a farmer has an accident. I am aware of a farmer who broke a leg. He was conscious and able to use his mobile phone, but because he had no signal, he had to lie in severe pain until somebody found him. That shows the importance of mobile phone coverage these days. It is an essential, not a luxury.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/4">I am pleased the Government have reached an agreement with the mobile phone companies. It means that the latter will be investing at least &#163;5 billion over the next three years to extend coverage and improve signal strength, and that the number of places not covered by mobile coverage will reduce by two thirds. However, I will keep fighting for 100% coverage and speedy repairs, because speedy repairs are as crucial as the original investment. It is no good having a box-ticking exercise with an investment strategy, and then failing to maintain the service. Constituents with contracts with Vodafone are entitled to use the service. Leaving everything to the market is no good, because the mobile companies and BT Openreach would simply concentrate on the densely populated areas and ignore the highlands and islands. The Government should introduce performance standards for repairs and fine companies that fail to meet them.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/5">Having criticised Vodafone for its failure to carry out repairs in a reasonable time, I want to congratulate it on its Rural Open Sure Signal programme, which will bring</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/6">mobile phone coverage to several villages in my constituency. However, I urge it to follow up the initial investment and all the publicity with a proper repair service, because that investment is no good if the system does not work.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/7">I was pleased when in 2013 the Government gave Arqiva a contract to build mobile phone masts in places where there was no signal. The new masts were supposed to be up and running by the end of this year, but from the experience of Argyll and Bute, this programme seems to have badly stalled. The last time I met Arqiva, it could not say where in my constituency the new masts were to be sited or when they would be constructed. We need more transparency, and I hope the Minister will tell Arqiva to publish its intentions now. We need to know where the masts are going and when they will be put up.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/8">Bringing superfast broadband to rural areas is vital. I am pleased that more than 20% of the Government&#8217;s investment in superfast broadband&#8212;more than &#163;100 million&#8212;was given to the Scottish Government to bring superfast broadband to rural areas in Scotland. However, delivery was left to the Scottish Government, and they gave the contract to BT Openreach. Cables have been laid and some addresses have been connected to the new superfast broadband, but most of Argyll and Bute is extremely frustrated that neither the Scottish Government nor BT can tell them when, or even if, they will get broadband. Some people on very slow speeds tell me they do not want superfast broadband; they just want a decent broadband service.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/9">The Scottish Government and BT must be much more open and tell people when, or if, their home or business will be connected to fibre-optic broadband. Not knowing what is happening prevents people from making other arrangements, such as wireless or satellite. Given these failings, I must congratulate a local organisation on its initiative. Mull and Iona Community Trust, well led by its extremely enterprising general manager, Moray Finch, is leading the way with a project that will deliver superfast broadband by wireless to parts of Mull and Islay, as well as to the islands of Iona, Colonsay, Lismore, Luing and Jura, and to Craignish on the mainland. MICT has done very well, but that same type of project should be going on throughout Argyll and Bute, because in many places it is simply not practical to deliver superfast broadband via fibre-optic cable. I want the Scottish Government to follow the lead of the Mull and Iona Community Trust and work with community groups throughout Argyll and Bute to deliver superfast broadband everywhere in the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/10">It is not just in remote rural areas that problems arise. BT promised that the town of Dunoon in my constituency would get superfast broadband paid through BT&#8217;s own resources last year. However, this was postponed without any announcement&#8212;it was only when people started complaining that we found this out&#8212;and it is supposed to be happening this year, but there is still no sign of anything happening. Some constituents receive extremely slow broadband speeds of well under a megabit in some cases. It is high time that BT got the work done and gave my constituents a decent broadband service.</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/11">Broadband and mobile phone services are essential these days. Investment in infrastructure and much speedier action when faults occur are essential. The Scottish Government and BT must drastically improve their performance to bring superfast broadband to Argyll</p>
	<p pid="e.217.1/12">and Bute as a matter of urgency. BT and Vodafone must drastically improve their performance when repairs are needed. The loss of both landline and mobile phone services in Argyll and Bute this winter have been unacceptable. I call on the Government to beef up the regulations so that phone companies can be fined for poor performance when repairs to the phone infrastructure are needed.</p>

	<p pid="e.219.0/1">This is an important topic, and I shall concentrate on rural broadband rather than mobile technology. In Devon, we have challenges with both, but the broadband issue is certainly acute.</p>
	<p pid="e.219.0/2">It must be said at the outset that the Government are to be congratulated on their ambition to achieve 95% superfast broadband coverage by 2017, which is admirable. The Government are to be congratulated, too, on the level of contribution provided to those in rural areas. Devon has had a generous settlement, so the real challenge has been matching that funding. At the moment, we are pretty much on course to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="e.219.0/3">As a number of colleagues have acknowledged, the challenge is in implementation. The first challenge is to manage expectation. The original maps on what was going to get done and when were, frankly, not fit for purpose. The current offering is very much better, and I accept the limitation that a postcode can never entirely clarify exactly where people can and cannot get broadband. The problem is that the consumer who signs up for superfast does not know that. If we cannot do a better job, can we have at the very least a health warning or something put in the contract so that people realise that at the end of the day when they have paid their money, they still may not be able to receive superfast broadband?</p>
	<p pid="e.219.0/4">My second point is managing the roll-out, which has been mentioned by a number of colleagues. Clearly, to get to this 95% figure, we will have to make sure that the commercial commitment from BT and the subsidised commitment from BDUK are both met. There is a concern that although the match funding projects with BDUK are moving forward at a reasonable pace, the commercial ones are not. This needs to be carefully managed.</p>
	<p pid="e.219.0/5">Thirdly, dealing with the last 5% is most important. If people live in a rural part of the country, it is critical to take account of it first and foremost rather than last or as an afterthought.</p>

	<p pid="e.219.1/1">We talk about the 5%, but in many constituencies&#8212;mine included&#8212;a lot more than 5% are affected. It might be 5% nationally, but it is probably in the order of 65% of my constituency that do not receive superfast broadband. We need to concentrate more on getting this out to the harder-to-reach not spots.</p>

	<p pid="e.219.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an appropriate point. Although the Government have done a good job looking at the new technologies&#8212;I believe they have considered reducing the options to about three&#8212;we need more than just &#8220;these are the best options&#8221;. It needs to be rolled out, and MPs and councils need to be kept well abreast of what the options are. With self-help support for local communities, we should be able to make this happen.</p>
	<p pid="e.219.2/2">My communities have got together in a number of areas&#8212;and dug ditches and done deals with BT&#8212;but this is not well publicised. People living in a community who know that superfast is not coming any time soon are likely to have very little support from the Government. There is very little knowledge that would enable people to get on and do it. The Minister very helpfully provided me with the names of some satellite companies in my constituency, one of which has proved to be first-class. However, I am not convinced that I would have been given an answer if I had not asked the question.</p>
	<p pid="e.219.2/3">We must bear in mind that the alternatives have cost implications. I believe that there is a system in Wales whereby vouchers are provided for those who have to take the satellite rather than the fibre route. I urge the Government to think carefully about what can be done to help communities that need help now, rather than waiting until everything else is finished.</p>

	<p pid="e.220.0/1">My hon. Friend has talked about those who are hard to reach. Does she agree that another technical problem has emerged? The longer it takes to provide a superfast connection, the less likely it is that the speed being offered will be sufficient to deal with the new technology that will then be available. That is a further reason to continue the great work that the Government are doing, and to seek alternatives so that the technology is not compromised at the end of the process.</p>

	<p pid="e.220.1/1">That is an excellent point, and I am sure that the Minister will take it on board.</p>
	<p pid="e.220.1/2">My fifth point is this. I do not feel that businesses are at the forefront of the challenge. Broadband is now as necessary as electricity and gas&#8212;it is the fourth utility&#8212;and if businesses cannot be supported, we are not doing our economy justice. Business parks and business estates are not automatically connected, and BT has been reluctant to deal with that, telling my constituents that it would not be profitable. That, to me, is a real challenge, because I think that businesses must be seen in a very special way.</p>

	<p pid="e.220.2/1">I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend is saying. I think that it applies not only to businesses and commercial premises, but to planning for housing estates. It is vital for the respective departments and planning authorities to talk to each other as the houses are being built. Superfast broadband should be built into new developments, rather than individual constituents having to apply for it after buying their houses.</p>

	<p pid="e.220.3/1">That is an extremely good point. BT may claim that the development is in an area that they do not expect to expand enough to justify the commercial cost, but that is not an argument. We know that development will continue. Broadband should be built in at the start: it is no good waiting for it to be a challenge later on. As for businesses, I find it rather horrifying that 35% of business people who work from home still rely on mobile broadband and 45,000 businesses still rely on dial-up. That simply cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="e.220.3/2">I have reached my sixth point. The House will be pleased to know that the list is shortening. I think that the promise that everyone will get at least 2 megabits per</p>
	<p pid="e.220.3/3">second poses a real challenge to the Government, because, in my view, that is not enough.</p>

	<p pid="e.221.1/1">I will not, because I am short of time.</p>
	<p pid="e.221.1/2">I think that we should take account of the demand for a minimum of 5 megabits per second rather than 2. I gather that the average speed that we have managed to deliver is just over 5 megabits per second, so let us aim for that. I think that the Federation of Small Businesses is considering 10 megabits, which may be a bit hopeful at this stage, but a speed of 2 megabits per second is not fit for purpose. Whether people have enough supply to carry out even some of the most basic tasks, such as reading e-mails, depends very much on the level of demand.</p>
	<p pid="e.221.1/3">Last on my wish list are two technical points. One is the challenge posed by the wiring between the cabinet and the home. All the rhetoric is about getting superfast broadband to the cabinet. I have asked Ministers, BT and just about everyone else I can think of who is responsible for upgrading the connection, but they have all looked sideways and said &#8220;Not me.&#8221; Well, it certainly is not the home owner. We need to clarify who is responsible, because if we do not deal with that, getting the wire to the cabinet will not solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="e.221.1/4">My final point is about take-up. I know that the Government consider that to be one of the real challenges, which is why they have launched an advertising campaign. If take-up is too low, BT will not have a commercial incentive. However, I think that we need to view the position differently. It is not just a question of advertising. The whole concept of the importance of broadband needs to be hard-wired&#8212;forgive the pun&#8212;into our planning system, and into how we view buying, selling or renting a property. The information about what is available needs to be there up front; it needs to be part and parcel of searches and the general inquiry someone makes when looking for a new home.</p>
	<p pid="e.221.1/5">Let me summarise my key points and requests to the Government. First, we should look at how we can make the sector more competitive, and consider having the Competition and Markets Authority and Ofcom looking at it. Many Members have raised that point. The challenges and problems we face are in part to do with having effectively a monopoly supplier in BT, because unless it is in its interests and it can make money out of it, it simply does not happen. Secondly, please can we move to more than 2 megabits per second? Thirdly, can we look at improving the self-help? If we can improve the information flow so that people understand what can be done and when, that will be great.</p>
	<p pid="e.221.1/6">That is a very brief summary, but I hope the Minister has taken on board many of those points.</p>

	<p pid="e.222.0/1">Broadband is just as essential to homes and businesses as electricity and telephone lines in the 21st century. All of us endorse the long-term economic plan as the way in which this Government will turn the country around in the future, and key to that is having broadband, including broadband to the rural areas of our country. In debates such as this, I often hear colleagues talking about their very rural constituencies, but, as you will know, Mr Speaker, my constituency is the most rural in all of England and it is the least densely populated constituency per square mile&#8212;there are 1,250 square miles&#8212;in England too.</p>
	<p pid="e.222.0/2">As with Mark Antony and Julius Caesar, I come to praise the Minister, not to criticise him, because the reality is that he is an honourable man and he has in an epic recession overseen a very substantial investment of Government money into Northumberland, which has resulted in the provision of significant amounts of broadband. That money, going through Northumberland county council and working with BT Openreach, has provided a significant expansion on the utterly woeful situation we inherited in 2010. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Throughout this debate we have heard endless chunterings from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>&#8212;one of only two Labour Members on the Opposition Benches, so interested are Labour Members in this subject&#8212;but in reality we were left with a terrible situation that this Government have, to their great credit, turned around.</p>

	<p pid="e.222.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the near absolute absence of Members on the Opposition Benches shows the indifference to the rural interest that too often seizes the Labour party, so that even when there are arguments that would reasonably be accepted by their Members they do not come here to hear them, and that rural residents across the country need to recognise which parties do take an interest&#8212;including our coalition partners?</p>

	<p pid="e.222.2/1">In what must be the ultimate not spot, nobody who represents an England or a Scotland constituency is present on the Labour Benches. It is not very impressive, we would all agree.</p>
	<p pid="e.222.2/2">I want to start by talking about the progress that has been made in Northumberland, such that there has now been provision of fibre broadband to Stocksfield, Heddon, parts of Wylam, Ponteland, Stamfordham, Great Whittington, Prudhoe, most of Corbridge, Slaley, most of Hexham, parts of Allendale, Gilsland&#8212;as Joan Thirlaway only recently texted me&#8212;Greenhead, Haltwhistle, Bardon Mill, Haydon Bridge, Humshaugh, Wall, Chollerford and Wark, all of which is very successful. Sadly however, as the House will be aware, I could also give quite a long list of villages and places which have not had that benefit, although the local authority and BT assure me that it will be provided in 2015. Indeed, only today I received notification from Lieutenant Colonel Richard Clements, the commanding officer of 39 Regiment Royal Artillery, that Albemarle barracks, after many years of not having broadband, now has&#8212;literally as of today&#8212;fibre broadband being provided to it and the troops there, who have returned from Afghanistan. I pay tribute to the great work that he and all the people who work at that barracks have done to bring that development about.</p>
	<p pid="e.222.2/3">However, I could list a large number of villages that do not have broadband. It is fair to say that while progress has been made, there are gaps, misnomers and, sadly, too many false dawns. All of us have seen examples of where BT&#8212;it is sometimes the county council, but primarily it is BT&#8212;will suggest, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all going to be wonderful in this village. We are providing this broadband to the village, or town.&#8221; Sadly, however, what happens is that the broadband is not provided, or else there is only partial provision.</p>

	<p pid="e.223.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to make the point about false dawns; I have had many such instances in my constituency.

	<p pid="e.223.1/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, and I can give examples of that situation. Corbridge Computing Ltd was as excited as I was when Corbridge, a substantial town in my constituency, was told on <phrase class="date" code="2014-09-19">19 September 2014</phrase> that it had received upgraded broadband. The company asked for the installation the next day; it is just metres from the exchange and various cabinets. To this day, however, it has still not been provided with any upgraded broadband. I could give similar examples, for instance at Dissington Hall. I will open its new rural enterprise hub, which is just outside Ponteland, this Friday, and it is hoped that new businesses will start up there, but to begin with there is the difficulty of not having the internet support that businesses obviously need. In a moment, I will discuss the problems that exist in the village of Matfen.</p>
	<p pid="e.223.1/2">The reality is that we have false dawns and the situation is extremely difficult, because the lack of communication, and the inability of the roll-out to perform as we were originally told it would, lead to a loss of enthusiasm and support among local communities and constituents.</p>

	<p pid="e.223.2/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the failure of the roll-out to deliver what is expected of it. Does he share the concern of residents in a new development in my constituency, called Abbottswood, which is right on the edge of Romsey? On moving into their new properties&#8212;there are 800 new homes in total&#8212;they expected that they would have high-speed broadband, but, unlike the rest of Romsey, they have nothing.</p>

	<p pid="e.223.3/1">That relates to the point I genuinely want the Minister to respond to. Where there are new developments up and down the country, it must be part of the section 106 agreement of planning that the housing developer installs broadband as part of the planning agreement. It seems utterly illogical that we have either residential or mixed-use developments being brought forward without this fundamental precondition. If nothing else comes from this debate, we must surely address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="e.223.3/2">I make the point to the Minister that in Northumberland we have not slept on our laurels. We have explored alternatives. Many people in the county have satellite solutions, or line-of-sight solutions such as Wildcard,</p>
	<p pid="e.223.3/3">which serves all the village of Newton. In those circumstances, such providers have genuinely made a difference locally.</p>
	<p pid="e.223.3/4">Sadly, however, value for money is the key driver of Government policy. I understand why that is the case in a recession, but the consequence of value for money being a driver of policy means that the last 5%&#8212;or, as in rural constituencies such as mine, that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase>, and those of the hon. Members from Cornwall and Devon, those hard-to-reach areas or total not spots&#8212;are always the last ones in the queue, because it is so much easier to address those areas with limited broadband, or those that are easier to connect to the exchange. The Government must look at the way in which they structure agreements in the future, so that a change in emphasis takes place. Without that, I foresee difficulty in getting the roll-out to the hard-to-reach areas.</p>
	<p pid="e.223.3/5">I have repeatedly had meetings with the Minister, the Secretary of State, Broadband Delivery UK, which I met last week, and BT Openreach, the head of which I met only yesterday in the House of Commons. I welcome the fact that a genuine difference is being made, because it is important. I see that when I look at the example of Matfen, a village in my constituency that has had particular difficulties. People there were encouraged by BDUK to seek significant demand registration under the iNorthumberland procedure, to encourage greater funding and to encourage BT to tailor its roll-out to those areas. The consequence is that they sign up to these things but are then told that they are not going to be part of the roll-out that they thought their sign-up was so good for. In the case of Matfen we are exploring, and will be in various meetings in February, how to find a way forward in phase 2 of the roll-out, because these things create false expectation among our communities, which is not good. I appreciate the work BDUK and BT Openreach are doing to try to turn this problem around. When I spoke to executives from BT Openreach yesterday, they made it clear to me that Northumberland was a future priority for them, and my constituents will be delighted if that is genuinely proven in the developments that we hope will take place.</p>
	<p pid="e.223.3/6">We will need to look at not only the planning point I raised earlier, but how LEPs, and rural growth funds can support provision. We still have silos, whereby BDUK, BT Openreach and the Government are working in one silo, and the LEPs and others are working in another. It is extraordinarily difficult to get everybody in the same room, getting a holistic group view on the particular problem. Let me finish by mentioning the problem of towers and masts. My constituency has more than 50 masts belonging to various different parts of government, but it is extraordinarily difficult to get all those masts to be signed up for the provision, ultimately, of broadband.</p>

	<p pid="e.224.0/1">I am pleased to take part in this debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> on securing it, because it has highlighted, across the Chamber, the need for broadband and mobile reception in rural areas, and the recognition that it is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.</p>
	<p pid="e.224.0/2">Let me start by discussing the basic need for some kind of phone that connects someone&#8217;s house to the network and by reinforcing the concerns about the performance of Openreach in the most basic provision of phone lines, especially to new builds in the constituency. It has sometimes taken six months between someone moving into a house and their having a basic phone connection. We are talking not about superfast broadband or broadband, but a basic phone connection. Anything that the Minister can do to improve that performance will be welcome; the point has been made that such a connection should be treated like electricity and water as an essential service to the household. I hope he will also deal with the relationship between Openreach and the service provider in ensuring that the consumer gets compensation for a failure to deliver. Such compensation would help focus the mind and make some recompense for people not having that basic service.</p>
	<p pid="e.224.0/3">As many have said, we still need to roll out basic broadband to many of our constituents. I remember that when the first roll-out took place <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase> was the Minister. He was an extremely useful Minister for my constituency, because he dealt with broadband, post offices and the oil and gas industry, bringing together almost all the casework for someone dealing with a reserved section of the legislation, given that so many other activities are devolved to the Scottish Parliament. He was being shown all the different innovative projects. At the time, Scottish and Southern Energy was going to do broadband through the electricity cabling, but suddenly the exchange in Stonehaven mysteriously reached the trigger point for BT to roll out ADSL. The point about competition and the importance of driving forward innovation has been made well in this debate. The wi-fi solution for many of those places still needing a broadband connection has been highlighted by others as an important way forward.</p>
	<p pid="e.224.0/4">I particularly wish to reinforce the importance of superfast broadband to the north-east of Scotland, because with the oil and gas industry, there are a lot of businesses dealing with large amounts of data, and a lot of those businesses have grown up in rural parts of Aberdeenshire. Similarly, many people who work in the industry or work abroad could work from home if they had the proper superfast connections to deal with the data. The money that the UK Government have given to the Scottish Government needs to deliver on the ground for those people in the north-east of Scotland if we are to keep a vital industry effective, at its most efficient and raising more money for the tax system to reinforce investment in infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="e.224.0/5">The other challenge is not just the mobile phone reception from the network but the fact that many of the traditional houses are made of granite, which mobile phone signals cannot penetrate. The business centre in which the constituency office is based is a brand new building with high-quality insulation, which again cannot be penetrated by mobile phone signals.</p>

	<p pid="e.225.0/1">The hon. Gentleman cites a problem that is very similar to the one that exists in the valley communities in south Wales. People cannot get mobile telephony inside their homes because their houses are</p>
	<p pid="e.225.0/2">made of stone or granite which cannot be penetrated by the signal. A possible answer to that lies in wi-fi, for which people need broadband. People end up getting hit by a double whammy.</p>

	<p pid="e.226.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a point. There was also the illegal solution of boosters. Perhaps it is time for Ofcom to look at how mobile phone signals can be boosted in properties and business centres. Individual suppliers using wi-fi and broadband could be a solution&#8212;that could be the case for the business centre that I mentioned. There would need to be a signal booster for each network, but it should be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="e.226.0/2">Let me reinforce the fact that broadband and mobile phone connections are not a luxury; they are essential. It is time that we saw delivery to those rural areas that missed out the first time round.</p>

	<p pid="e.226.1/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate and to see in their seats so many parliamentary patrons of the rural fair share campaign. Although we are talking today about broadband and mobile coverage, we must see the matter in context. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> on securing this debate and the Backbench Committee on its work.</p>
	<p pid="e.226.1/2">Let us talk about context. It is a pity that we have no one other than the Opposition Whip and the shadow Minister in their place to hear this. The context is that people in rural areas are, on average, poorer than people in urban areas. They earn less; they have fewer services; they pay higher levels of council tax; and they suffer from lower funding of health, education, police and fire services. To add to that disadvantage, they find that they are in the 5% or 10%&#8212;whatever percentage it is in some grand number&#8212;that does not get the good thing that we are talking about. That merely compounds a disadvantage that is to be found in so many areas already.</p>
	<p pid="e.226.1/3">What we need to do from the rural interest point of view is recognise that rurality is a need in the same way that deprivation is a need. It drives cost in the way that deprivation does, and we must make the case. We must have a broad understanding of the needs of rural communities. Let me say to the Opposition Whip, who, unfortunately for him, is in his place, that when we were discussing the Government&#8217;s programme to bring decent broadband service to rural areas, one of his colleagues said that it would mean faster internet shopping for millionaires&#8212;he went on to say faster internet shopping for wealthy people. That is a misconception of the disadvantage and low income of so many people in rural areas. They are removed from services and removed from access. The one thing that they had hoped would close that gap is digital technology, but all too often that is closed to them as well. That is the context.</p>

	<p pid="e.226.2/1">Given that the fundamental challenge of rural areas is the barrier of distance, surely what we need to emphasise is that there is nothing more powerful than the technology of broadband and mobile in overcoming that barrier and in bringing rural areas all the opportunities of networked lives.</p>

	<p pid="e.227.0/1">My hon. Friend is right. I pay tribute to him for how since the moment he was first elected and arrived in this Chamber&#8212;and probably before that&#8212;he has taken seriously the need to get broadband into his rural constituency. It was a privilege to attend a conference that he organised for hundreds of people in Cumbria some years ago exactly to highlight this problem.</p>
	<p pid="e.227.0/2">I want to move on to talk about the long-term economic plan. When we consider the economic needs of the nation, one thing we see is that there is a productivity gap between urban and rural areas. The analysis of why that productivity gap exists shows that the problem is connectivity. It can be about highways and railways and buses, but, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> rightly says, it is also about the digital divide. That is why if we are to have an equitable country that is fair to all and that closes those gaps, we must prioritise this issue.</p>
	<p pid="e.227.0/3">My hon. Friends must realise that after 13 years of the previous Government&#8212;understandably, as we can see the level of interest in rural issues among Opposition Members&#8212;fewer than half of all households, and those the easy and commercially available households, have superfast broadband. It is this Government, who in so many ways have had to do the heavy lifting, who have taken that figure to three quarters of households and who, by 2017, will be delivering 95% coverage. As has been said, I am concerned about the other 5%.</p>

	<p pid="e.227.2/1">I will give way to the shadow Minister and I hope that he will apologise not only for the failure of members of his party to take an interest in this vital issue but for the fact that in government&#8212;perhaps preoccupied with other matters&#8212;Labour did not focus enough on the needs of people in rural areas or recognise the disadvantage there.</p>

	<p pid="e.227.3/1">I am sort of grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but I was not going to make a very aggressive point. I was just going to suggest that he might correct his figures. Superfast broadband is not the major issue that most people have been complaining about in the debate. The complaints have been about getting even to 2 megabits per second. Our ambition, which we would have secured, was to reach that speed for everybody by 2012 and it was his Government who abandoned that target.</p>

	<p pid="e.227.4/1">With respect to the hon. Gentleman, the only people I have heard who felt that that programme was on track to be delivered were representatives of the Labour party. It is a shame that there are not more of those representatives in the Chamber today to intervene and explain precisely how it was going to be delivered. The hon. Gentleman is an excellent advocate for a difficult cause, and I respect that as a politician, but the truth is, as he knows, that the record of his party was weak. The record of the Conservative party is distinctly better, but we should recognise the context. We are all saying to the Government and to the Minister that it is not enough; we must go further and that is why we are here today. It is great to have the shadow Minister here today, even if we do not have any of his colleagues&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;There is one!&#8221;] I apologise.</p>

	<p pid="e.228.0/1">May I take the hon. Gentleman back to the question of the economy and growing businesses? One quick boost that we could give to a lot of small businesses would be to encourage entrepreneurs who want to provide broadband by a wi-fi connection to places that will never gain from 3 miles of copper cable to the nearest exchange. I met such an entrepreneur only last week who was to provide for about half a dozen villages in my area. I would love to point him towards the Government funding that would give him the start that would enable that to happen, but at the moment it is not obviously there.</p>

	<p pid="e.228.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. One of the challenges for the Government is that they are not very good at dealing with small organisations. I have a company offering a service in my area called Quickline. It contacted me and said that it would love to launch a hub in a local pub and then to offer it out to the surrounding community. I was rather rotten to the person who approached me, as I thought they were looking to do it somewhere quite close to Beverley, which would be easier. I said, &#8220;What about Holmpton, down near Withernsea?&#8221; I thought that it was about the most challenging place I could find for them and, to be fair, they agreed. The George and Dragon had that hub installed a couple of years ago and provided the offer in an area that was otherwise a not spot. It is difficult for Government, who have to secure and assure the use of public money, but we must find a way of dealing with small companies, some of which might go down as well as up. We must take some risks if we are to deliver this goal.</p>

	<p pid="e.228.2/1">I could not agree more that connectivity for rural businesses is an essential service. Does my hon. Friend agree with me that the rural broadband voucher scheme, which is used in Oxfordshire to provide small businesses with up to &#163;30,000 to pay for superfast broadband connections, has been a really valuable scheme? It expires at the end of March, and it would be helpful to know what might replace it.</p>

	<p pid="e.228.3/1">My hon. Friend has put that on the record and I am sure the Minister will try to answer. I hope he has time to answer the many questions that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="e.228.3/2">As we know, the 95% delivery target for phase 2 funding is a national target, and obviously there are fears among colleagues that the 5% figure may turn out to be larger than that in their area. The aim was that the funding for that, for which &#163;5 million came to the East Riding, should be matched&#8212;it is a shame to see that there is not even a shadow Minister now, just a Whip, however marvellous he may be, which he is, of course. However, East Riding of Yorkshire council is struggling to find the other &#163;5 million, so there is a danger that we will not get the 95% provision.</p>
	<p pid="e.228.3/3">What can be done to make sure that we target the most hard to reach? It does not matter what we are dealing with, whether it is the DECC work to reduce home energy use or anything else, the tendency is to</p>
	<p pid="e.228.3/4">pick off the low-hanging fruit, the easy targets. Somehow we need to design a system that starts with the most difficult-to-reach properties and works back. That way, we are the least likely to do as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047" name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase> said, which is subsidise something that would happen anyway and not target the money on those who need it the most. That is important for the future.</p>
	<p pid="e.228.3/5">It is estimated that by 2024, the Government&#8217;s current investment in faster broadband will be boosting rural economies by &#163;275 million every month&#8212;not each year&#8212;which is about &#163;9 million every day. It makes economic sense as well as good social capital sense to make the investment. Will the Minister update the House on the innovation fund we have heard about today, which is available for alternative technology providers who can then come up with innovative and radical approaches to reach the most remote communities? If he can do that, we will be grateful. Is there a prospect of the fund being increased?</p>
	<p pid="e.228.3/6">I was delighted to hear that the Minister secured a landmark deal with mobile networks to improve mobile coverage across the UK. I mentioned earlier that, following that agreement, Vodafone will be extending 3G coverage in my constituency from just over 20% now to 99% by 2017. That is a significant move forward.</p>
	<p pid="e.228.3/7">What are the Government doing to ensure that broadband infrastructure is available in areas where it would not be commercially viable for companies to install it? Also, as the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report today asks, is enough being done to hold BT to its promises? What about commercial plans from providers such as Kingston Communications, in our area? In those areas where the commercial providers said provision was commercial, they have not always fulfilled and moved on. We need to make sure we have a system in place that holds them all to account, but I congratulate the Government on doing so much more, despite the chuntering from the Opposition.</p>

	<p pid="e.229.0/2">I am sure the Minister has a good idea of some of the things I am going to say, but before I go into what are essentially concerns about rural roll-out, I will add my voice to the view expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris), for Hexham (Guy Opperman) and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) about the need, if we are building these thousands and thousands of new houses to try to make up for the previous Government&#8217;s failure, to make this fourth utility part and parcel of the build scheme. It seems incredible to me that it is not. I understand that the Government are looking into it, but it should already be in planning policy that these connections should be part of future building schemes.</p>
	<p pid="e.229.0/3">At the moment in Lancaster, where we have large regeneration schemes going on, people are moving into flats or houses and discovering that they have no connection</p>
	<p pid="e.229.0/4">and that individually they have to find a way to get connected. That is amazing in the 21st century, especially in apartment and flat-style properties, and it is something the Government need to get a grip on through planning policy.</p>

	<p pid="e.230.1/1">I agree, but that is not happening. The market is not yet delivering. Where it is not delivering, the Government should be delivering, in terms of planning regulations at the very least.</p>
	<p pid="e.230.1/2">On the roll-out of broadband, to be fair, the Government took the decision in 2010, which we all welcomed, to do something for that section of the rural community that had been left out for so long, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase> pointed out. Villages in Lancashire are being connected. It may be fast or slow in certain areas, but some of those contracts are being delivered. As the Minister knows, I, like other hon. Members, was concerned about the missing 5%. I was approached by a group led by Professor Barry Forde of Lancaster university, who said that the BT contracts could not work because of the copper to fibre issue, so BT would be unable to deliver the speeds that it had promised. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="e.230.4/1">I am sorry&#8212;last week. The weeks tend to blend into one. Some &#163;50 million, 98% coverage in Lancashire, and 150,000 premises&#8212;that has to be something to shout about, and I know that my hon.

	<p pid="e.230.5/1">I am grateful for the Minister&#8217;s intervention. He is right, and I paid tribute to that.</p>
	<p pid="e.230.5/2">Back to the missing 5%&#8212;the group led by Barry Forde suggested that it would take up the 5% with a not-for-profit social enterprise and deliver hyperfast super-broadband&#8212;that is, 1 gigabit&#8212;to every property within a defined area. The group approached me as a constituency MP. The group eventually became known as B4RN&#8212;broadband for the rural north. I can tell my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)</phrase> that B4RN does not lie between Lancashire and Yorkshire. It is based in Lancashire, but gives some help to Yorkshire, as usual.</p>
	<p pid="e.230.5/3">What the members of the group proposed to do seemed incredible at the time, but they have set about doing that since 2010 and have now wired up every single property in the villages of Arkholme, Abbeystead, Aughton, Capernwray, Dolphinholme, Gressingham, Newton, Docker, Littledale, Quernmore, Roeburndale,</p>
	<p pid="e.230.5/4">Wray, Wennington and Tatham, and soon to be connected are Melling, Whittington and Wrayton. The group is looking to wire up with 1 gigabite of speed 2,500 people. Already we have interest from businesses, doing the very thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness hopes will happen, which want to move into the area that B4RN covers because of the potential offered by this hyperfast broadband delivery.</p>
	<p pid="e.230.5/5">The history is interesting. When the group decided to do that in 2010-11, members applied for some of the funding from BDUK, but the district council and the county rolled up all the funds and gave all the grants to BT, which resulted in B4RN complaining to the European Commission about the use of state aid. B4RN agreed to drop the complaint provided that the county would protect its postcode areas, as against BT&#8217;s scheme.</p>
	<p pid="e.230.5/6">Hon. Members have mentioned the situation of BT, and I have brought up before the near-monopoly that exists.</p>

	<p pid="e.231.1/1">I stand corrected; it has all the features of a monopoly. Let me give an example. One of the villages supposedly in the BT area is Dolphinholme, which lies between two villages that B4RN was going to wire up, so its wiring went through the village. Villagers there had been waiting for BT, but it had not yet turned up, so they asked B4RN to connect them. B4RN then began connecting those people who requested it. BT has since moved into the village and, instead of just replacing copper with fibre, is wiring the node all the way through in a way that it has not done anywhere else in Lancashire, and all for a village of just over 200 people. Why is that? It looks as though that multi-million pound business is trying to squeeze out a voluntary, not-for-profit organisation that is proving extremely successful.</p>

	<p pid="e.231.3/1">Absolutely. As we have heard hon. Members shout from across the Chamber, it is the behaviour of a monopoly.</p>
	<p pid="e.231.3/2">Another characteristic of a monopoly is a lack of transparency. Let me give another example. Two weeks ago a resident of the village of Scorton, which was to be wired up by BT, approached me to say that he was having problems getting in touch with BT to find out what was going on. He runs a medium-sized engineering company from home with national contracts. I took the first step of any constituency MP and asked BT what was going on. I was told that there were technical difficulties. Eventually, I went to meet the resident in Scorton and found that he had been told that BT was now de-scoping the area because it was too difficult&#8212;I had been told one story, and he had been told another.</p>
	<p pid="e.231.3/3">I am still waiting, three years down the line, for BT to hand me a map showing exactly what it is doing. Let me explain to hon. Members that these are villages up in the Pennines. Then there are places, such as Glasson Dock, which lies on flat land on the coast just beyond Lancaster, that BT is not wiring up, even though there</p>
	<p pid="e.231.3/4">are more residents there than in Dolphinholme, where it is delivering fibre, fibre, fibre. I know that the Public Accounts Committee has looked at the situation, but I would ask it to look again at the BT situation.</p>

	<p pid="e.232.0/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s wish has been granted, because at the end of last week the National Audit Office issued a report praising the effectiveness of the broadband roll-out scheme.</p>

	<p pid="e.232.1/1">I beg to differ. Perhaps the Select Committee that looked at it here could recall BT. I have made inquiries about how to get the competition authorities to look at the situation. This is the behaviour of a monopoly: there is no transparency, we are not being told what is going on, and indeed we are being given disinformation.</p>

	<p pid="e.232.3/1">No, because I know that the Minister is not complacent, and I know that delivery across most of Lancashire is extremely effective, as the hon. Gentleman would have heard had he been here at the beginning. What hon. Members here are concerned about is the last 5%. I ask the Minister once again to look at BT&#8217;s performance in that remaining area.</p>

	<p pid="e.232.6/1">It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> on securing it once again. The real challenge, as we have heard in contributions from across the House, is the remaining 5% and the pitch of frustration our constituents feel when we do not see sufficiently rapid movement, when there seems to be a lack of reliable information and when they cannot get the answers they so desperately need. A significant portion of the e-mails I receive relate to the remaining 5% in south Wiltshire.</p>
	<p pid="e.232.6/2">Connectivity is an essential part of our daily lives&#8212;it is the fourth utility&#8212;but it has not existed reliably in some parts of my constituency. Just a few months ago, residents in Bishopstone and Coombe Bissett were cut off completely from the outside world when there was a fault on their main telephone lines. Neither village has mobile phone coverage, so the loss of the connection left elderly residents unable to reach their panic buttons, employees unable to pay their tax bills, and at least one local business on the verge of collapse. This happened four and a half miles from the city of Salisbury. That is why we need to look carefully at all the options that exist at this point in the delivery of the roll-out to maximise broadband, and 4G, coverage.</p>
	<p pid="e.232.6/3">Rural communities are resilient and innovative, as several colleagues from across the House have said, but we must do more to help them benefit from creative solutions. Two villages in my constituency, Broad Chalke and Winterslow&#8212;I thank the Minister for visiting</p>
	<p pid="e.232.6/4">Winterslow a couple of years ago&#8212;have benefited from Vodafone&#8217;s Rural Open Sure Signal programme, which provides 3G coverage to sparsely populated areas that otherwise would have none. That has had a transformative effect. The simplest tasks, such as schools phoning parents when their children are ill, or lost delivery drivers getting in touch, were impossible without this technology. It is imperative that we continue to look creatively at other solutions that might exist and that we do not offer inferior solutions on the grounds of cost alone, and cost as it is today.</p>
	<p pid="e.232.6/5">One of my constituents who is a dedicated campaigner for better connectivity in rural areas has lived with satellite broadband for nine years. That system relies on individual packets of data being sent about 44,000 km from a satellite. He tells me that while the system functions well when downloading large files, the delay in these packets of data makes everyday browsing or video streaming very difficult. I therefore urge the Minister to ensure that alternative solutions are also on the table. I am aware that the Government have put &#163;10 million into the pilot schemes in rural areas using different technologies, and that they will be evaluating the success of those different pilot schemes. I echo the comments of hon. Members who said that more needs to be allocated to that initiative, because that is where the last 2% or 3% are going to find their solutions. There are improvements in technology all the time, and the Government need to be right on top of the best solutions as they come into existence.</p>
	<p pid="e.232.6/6">By sheer coincidence, my constituent had a new 4G mast erected close enough that he could benefit from it. I want to highlight to mobile phone companies, and to the Minister, the immense opportunity that exists in this regard. There are areas of the country that will not be able to benefit from fibre broadband cost-effectively but where 4G could provide an answer. That can be nothing short of transformative for these communities, and, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase> said, for urban areas as well.</p>
	<p pid="e.232.6/7">I hope the Minister has listened carefully to the intense and sincere speeches that have been made, because there are serious issues for constituents across the country who are so frustrated when they cannot get this matter resolved. We need to make sure that we use the new technologies and that they are delivered as quickly as possible. We should welcome the fact that only 3% of premises in the UK are now suffering speeds below 2 Mb, down from 11% in 2010, but let us not be complacent. Let us do as much as we possibly can to speed up the roll-out for the last 5%, or even the last 2%, who we all intensely fear will never get a solution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-02-03e.234.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40701" speakername="Robert Jenrick" colnum="234"  time="018:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150203/debtext/150203-0004.htm#150203-0004.htm_spnew13">
	<p pid="e.234.1/1">I will deal with that last.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/2">During his Westminster Hall debate, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> set out eloquently the moral and economic case for broadband in rural areas. It is not just about isolation, but about enabling people to lead full lives in an interconnected world and to consume the news, learn, be economically active and connect with relatives who live around the country and the world. I am part of perhaps the last generation of MPs to have known the world before broadband, and the opportunities it presents are immeasurably greater than those I knew as a child.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/3">The greatest barrier to aspiration and meritocracy is lack of information. Individuals frequently set their horizons according to the world they know and have it broadened by more information and knowledge about which university to go to and which employer to seek out. It is no exaggeration to say that broadband access is about giving young people and those of all ages the benefits of the rich possibilities of our interconnected world. Not having those opportunities has a major effect. It is also evident that such access is about economic growth. The 150 villages in my constituency are brimming with small businesses, entrepreneurs and communities that want to get on and succeed, but they are being held back, with one hand tied behind their back, because of a lack of broadband access.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/4">This is also about closing both the rural-urban gap and the north-south divide. Some 350 people commute from Newark to London. That is a difficult journey to make every day, but it can be made regularly if people can work from home with good quality broadband.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/5">Nottinghamshire county council has made good progress in recent years. I pay tribute to Nicola McCoy-Brown, my contact at the council, and the &#163;20 million better broadband for Nottinghamshire programme. A number of villages, including Collingham, have seen huge improvements in recent years, but a huge amount of work remains to be done. More than 40 villages in my constituency have little broadband, certainly not enough to run a business or to work or do proper education from home.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/6">I want to raise a few concerns. The first is whether all the public money is being well spent. Those Members familiar with my constituency will know that a vast swathe of it is, in effect, made up&#8212;my constituents will not thank me for saying this&#8212;of commuter villages that are almost the suburbs of Nottingham. I am surprised that those villages are deemed not economically viable for BT to be able to supply them. I suspect that East Bridgford, Bingham and villages surrounding Southwell are economically viable and that BT is not using public money appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/7">Secondly, the figures of 5% and 10% are frequently misused, because they are denoted by country and local authority. The result for local authorities that are predominantly urban, such as Nottinghamshire, is clearly very different from the result for those that are predominantly rural. My constituency is the 10% that is</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/8">rural in Nottinghamshire, so the definition of what is rural and remote in Nottinghamshire is different from that in Herefordshire, Wales and Cumbria. In fact, a vast swathe of that 10% is not particularly rural or remote at all. I think the definition is misused.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/9">I entirely endorse earlier comments about linking mobile and data. Smartphones are ubiquitous in my constituency, but no one can use them, even in Newark town. They are sold in all the shops by all the dealerships, but no one can use them.</p>
	<p pid="e.234.1/10">Time is against me, so I will finish by addressing Openreach. The company claims not to be a monopoly, but it displays all the characteristics of one. I know this issue is market sensitive, but I urge the Minister to look into it. For good business reasons, the organisation needs to be separated from BT and broken up. In the short term, I urge the Minister to do something about the appalling customer service at Openreach and to encourage it to treat its customers with the respect and dignity they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="e.235.0/1">I have followed the debate carefully and was not sure whether I would have time to speak, so I am delighted to be the last speaker from the Conservative ranks. My speech will, of course, commend the Government for the extraordinary work they have done on broadband, while suggesting one or two changes that will make all the difference.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> and the Backbench Business Committee on initiating this debate. The response from the House has made clear that he touched on a number of issues that are common to those of us who represent rural constituencies, wherever we sit in the House, and it has been essential to get the matter before the Minister and the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/3">My constituency exhibits a number of characteristics that we have heard about, such as properties with fewer than 2 megabits in local authorities that I represent&#8212;that affects 8.6% of properties in Central Bedfordshire and 12% in Bedford borough. Again, the same properties tend to miss out, and the hard to reach are genuinely hard to reach.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/4">I have an inventive and thoughtful community that has tried all sorts of different things. It is effective at putting a case together and has detailed plans. I have attended two public meetings in the village of Colmworth and heard a very detailed description of its business premises, residential areas, and the needs of such a rural area. North East Bedfordshire has a diverse community that depends on a relationship between the rural and the urban, as well as on connectivity. The opportunity to work there is becoming even more essential.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/5">Let me say two slightly controversial things. First, I praise BT&#8217;s regional partnership director, Annette Thorpe, who has worked incredibly hard with people in my region. I have met her more than a handful of times in different villages in my constituency. She has tried to meet some of the problems, but the difficulty has been that BT is overstretched. It has had too much work and has not been able to deliver, and it has been a problem to satisfy expectations. Annette Thorpe has worked extremely hard to do all she can.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/6">Secondly, my hon. Friend the Minister has been a victim of his own success. The Government inherited a poorly developed programme from the previous Government&#8212;whatever <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> says&#8212;and they have made remarkable steps forward. However, there is so much work to do and a limited number of people to do it, and it has not been possible to deliver everything we wanted. Communication has been crucial. In Bedford, BT has been struggling to deal with the volume of open market review requests and invitations to tender. That has resulted in it trying to make sense of its own data, which has held it back from the next steps it needs to take. The sheer volume of work being done has caused it to become a victim of its own success.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/7">As well as the familiar issues that colleagues have mentioned, there are some new ones. BT has realised that even when it gets to the end of its programme, it might not be able to deliver. There are some properties it just cannot reach, so what is to happen to them? If it does succeed in delivering 2 megabits, that will not be enough for existing technology, and the issue must be thought through.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/8">A further problem that we have not spent much time on concerns new developments in rural and market town constituencies. King&#8217;s Reach in Biggleswade is a new development on the edge of my largest town with 20,000-plus people, and they find it hard to get broadband and superfast broadband. I pay tribute to that community, which worked incredibly hard, and particularly to Councillor Bernard Rix, who led the work with BT, and my assistant, Mandy Setterfield. We have worked with Annette Thorpe&#8212;sometimes behind the scenes&#8212;to push things along, but there have been problems with siting cabinets and getting new properties linked up. When talking about linking up the old, we must not forget that we must also deal with linking up the new.</p>
	<p pid="e.235.0/9">Finally, I would like to take up the kind offer of my right hon. Friend to meet representatives from my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="e.236.2/1">If the Minister would kindly meet a group that represents not only the older rural areas that are trying to be connected, but representatives from the newer areas, I am sure he will understand our problems, including those in Dunton, which thought it was on the list and has now been bumped off.

	<p pid="e.236.3/1">As a brief coda to this excellent debate, I do not believe the Minister doubts my commitment to broadband in rural areas. We have spoken many times about it. I am grateful for his commitment to the roll-out of the programme across the country and what the Department</p>
	<p pid="e.236.3/2">for Culture, Media and Sport has done. I used to have meetings with him as a DEFRA Minister. The two Departments energised each other in those meetings.</p>
	<p pid="e.236.3/3">I am grateful to Somerset county council, of which I am sometimes critical on other matters. It has pushed strongly, but the fact remains that, despite its best efforts, very substantial parts of my constituency will still not get high-speed broadband in the initial roll-out. Often, they are the same parts that do not get mobile phone coverage.</p>
	<p pid="e.236.3/4">The Minister made a brilliantly witty speech at the opening of the Haynes International Motor museum in my constituency, but if he had any doubts, he heard directly from my constituents how important broadband is to us. It is important for them in their domestic circumstances and important for their businesses.</p>
	<p pid="e.236.3/5">We must now concentrate everything we have in Government and local government on ensuring that the bits that will not be reached catch up with the rest. That will not mean extending the BT contract, even if we know where the boundaries of the contract lie. It will not mean getting more large companies engaged in programmes across the country. It will mean stimulating many small businesses to provide wi-fi connections to small groups of villages, to provide the plugs to fill those gaps. We need to find the mechanism that makes that work effectively. If the Minister can do that in his remaining months in his current position, I will be eternally grateful to him. I may even take him up on the offer of meeting him with a few of my constituents to make the point yet again.</p>

	<p pid="e.237.0/1">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart)</phrase>. At times, I have felt as if I have walked into a meeting of the 1922 committee this afternoon&#8212;it has been a congregation of the excluded, the dispossessed and the disconnected. I should tell all hon. Members who have complained about the last 3% or 5% that I feel their pain. I recommend that they vote Labour at the general election because that is the only way they will get this sorted out.</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/2">For once, it is not just about the many, but about the few. As many hon. Members have said, mobile telephony and broadband&#8212;superfast broadband&#8212;are not luxuries any more. They are a fundamental and essential utility. People have a right to expect both in residential properties, and businesses have a right to expect them. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40426" name="Anne-Marie Morris">the hon. Member for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris)</phrase> said, many business parks are still not connected. Incidentally, ensuring that that is rolled out is the strongest argument for state intervention. That is one of the things we need to look at.</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/3">If hon. Members watched &#8220;Last Tango in Halifax&#8221; on Sunday evening, they will know how important mobile telephony is. A wedding might all too easily be cancelled because somebody did not manage to send a text message or get mobile coverage to be able to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m on my way.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/4">For that matter, in many places in the country, if people want to watch &#8220;Last Tango in Halifax&#8221; half an hour or an hour later on iPlayer, they would have to</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/5">have 2 megabits per second at least, and yet, as many hon. Members from parties on both sides of the Chamber have said, too many people cannot even get that 2 megabits per second. If somebody is upstairs watching YouTube on a tablet, somebody is downloading something on their smartphone and somebody else is watching iPlayer through their smart TV, even 5 megabits per second might not be enough because of contention ratios. Even when the technology has been rolled past their door, many people are not connected, either because they do not know the benefits or simply because there is not enough competition in the market to make it cheap enough for them to afford.</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/6">I warmly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40312" name="Jesse Norman">the hon. Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)</phrase> on introducing the debate. I know the problems in his constituency, because when I stayed there for the Hay festival last year, I had absolutely no means of finding the place where I was going because Google maps gave up on me, because there was no connectivity. I think Edmund Burke would have been proud of him. I am not sure Burke had a lot to say about mobile telephony, but he was quite keen on connections. After all, he said:</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/7">&#8220;The only liberty&#8230;is a liberty connected with order.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.237.0/8">I want to talk about the Government&#8217;s record. Hon. Members have snuck around the corner here a little bit. In essence, they know that most of what they have argued this afternoon is a criticism of the Government&#8217;s record. They have not put it in such terms, because they know there is a general election coming.</p>

	<p pid="e.238.5/1">On the Government&#8217;s record, I think what everybody has said today is that we have to take the whole country with us. That means 100%, not 93% or 95%. I merely point out to hon. Members that the original target was 2 megabits a second by 2012. That was abandoned by this Government, who moved the target to 2015. Now, the target has been moved to 2016. I suggest that that means we want lots of people to be able to run before some people are even able to walk in the digital economy, and I think that that is a mistake.</p>
	<p pid="e.238.5/2">The superfast target of 24 megabits a second has also been changed. It was 90% by 2015. Then, when the Government worked out that that simply was not going to happen, for all the reasons hon. Members have set out today, they moved it to 95% by 2016.</p>

	<p pid="e.239.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will be speaking in a few moments and we wait with bated breath. If he can bate his breath, I will bate mine.</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/2">When BT appeared before the Select Committee it said that we probably would not get to the 90% target until 2018, so there are problems. The Committee was absolutely right when it reported today that</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/3">&#8220;Repeated changes in target dates for rollout of superfast broadband inevitably reduce confidence that coverage will be achieved on time. They also leave those in the hardest-to-reach areas uncertain as to when their businesses will be able fully to engage with digital practices.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/4">The Committee, which is made up of all political parties in this House, is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/5">There are key decisions that I think the Government have taken ill-advisedly. The most important in terms of mobile telephony roll-out&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40418" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon)</phrase> effectively referred to this&#8212;is in relation to the electronic communications code. There are landowners in the country who have made it phenomenally difficult to put up a new mast or increase the size of a mast. The provisions in the electronic communications code need to be more like those that exist for electricity and water&#8212;the common utilities that we absolutely need&#8212;than as a luxury, which was how mobile phone telephony was originally looked on. The Government got the Law Commission to report two years ago on the electronic communications code. Only at the very last minute did they table very poorly drafted amendments to the Infrastructure Bill. They could have been on the Order Paper to be properly considered in the normal way a year ago. If hon. Members really want to tackle the problems of mobile telephony coverage across the country, they have to deal with the electronic communications code. The Government have misplayed this matter completely.</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/6">Incidentally, the hon. Member for Newbury said that we had to listen to the silent majority. I am not quite sure how one listens to silence. Maybe the point is that the silent majority are not connected and so do not have an opportunity to tell us what they think.</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/7">Another failed programme from the Government was the &#163;150 million mobile infrastructure project. One hon. Member gently suggested that it is a bit of a failing if only two masts, serving another 400 homes, have been put up in all that time. That is not a slight failure&#8212;it is a massive failure. The Government should be coming to the Dispatch Box to hang their heads in shame.</p>
	<p pid="e.239.0/8">Another &#163;150 million has been allocated to the super-connected cities programme, but why just cities? Why did they decide to give out vouchers only for superfast cities? Why not the whole country? I represent an area&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="e.240.0/2">The Government allocated &#163;150 million to the super-connected cities programme, but what did they do? They hid their light under a bushel&#8212;they did not tell anybody about the programme&#8212;and guess what? Nobody applied for the vouchers. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">The hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)</phrase> complained that we objected to the advertising programme. That is completely wrong. He should read his briefing note from the Whips a little more carefully. We complained there was no advertising, which is why there was no take-up and why, of the &#163;150 million, so far only &#163;20 million has been spent. That is another failure from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="e.240.0/3">On the tender process, I accept the point about having local communities drive the agenda rather than a national statist agenda, but I gently suggest that if we set up 44 separate areas, it will be almost inevitable that the only people able to compete with a company such as BT will be those with very deep pockets who could be almost certain of getting several contiguous tenders, and that was never going to happen. In effect, it resulted in a licence to create a monopoly, and where we have a monopoly, we need tough, serious rules to ensure greater competition.</p>
	<p pid="e.240.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40352" name="Eric Ollerenshaw">The hon. Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw)</phrase>, who lost his voice and was helped out by the Minister, made a sensible point about the lack of competition across the whole area, particularly in the provision between the cabinet and the home. That was exactly the problem with the incident he related about the company called B4RN. The other problem is that we are falling far short on take-up compared with roll-out. A far better economic model would be to drive roll-out by encouraging take-up, because people would understand what we need all these megabits for. People hear us talk about 24 megabits, 30 megabits, 50 megabits, 100 megabits, 1 gigabit, but actually nobody knows what we are talking about.</p>

	<p pid="e.240.2/1">The vast majority of people have no understanding of what we are talking about, which is why we have very low rates of take-up.</p>
	<p pid="e.240.2/2">The Government have taken some very wrong steps. For one, they ruled out wireless at the beginning. It is a delight that there is now a &#163;10 million pilot looking at wireless solutions, but it should have been in existence in 2011-12. It is too late now. It is wrong only to look at fibre to the cabinet, and not fibre to some properties, because the simple truth is that people whose houses are a long way from the cabinet will never be part of superfast broadband under the programme as thus exemplified.</p>
	<p pid="e.240.2/3">As I have said, there is next to no competition. If the Government are to spend the best part of &#163;500 million of taxpayers&#8217; money&#8212;most of it coming off the licence fee&#8212;they need to make a strong argument that it is meeting market failure, and I think that when they advanced phase 2, in particular, of superfast broadband without a proper business plan, they failed to prove it was meeting market failure. There is no evidence that this is meeting market failure, rather than simply helping BT make investments it would have made anyway.</p>

	<p pid="e.241.0/1">Let me begin by saying how grateful I am that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> mentioned E. M. Forster, because my late father campaigned for a blue plaque for E. M. Forster, which can now be seen on the flats in Arlington Park mansions in Chiswick. That is an aside, but I always like to mention my old dad, my late father, who was in the other place. I usually get to mention him during steel debates, but I digress.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/2">We have had an excellent debate with some 18 contributions, most from the Conservative Benches because only one Labour Back Bencher showed up to make a speech. That gives the lie to the Opposition spokesman&#8217;s protestations that Labour is interested in rural communities and interested in getting broadband to them.</p>

Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase> who I always remember saying&#8212;although not in this debate&#8212;that the only way he can get a signal is by standing on his kitchen cabinet.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/7">In the time available I cannot answer all the questions put to me, but I hope that in the course of my response</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/8">some of the issues will be covered. If they are not, I will write to each and every hon. Member who has made a contribution to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/9">Let me begin with the contribution of the hon. Member for Rhondda. We heard 10 or 15 minutes from him, but just as we searched the Benches behind him for any speakers, we searched for a policy in his speech&#8212;but policy could we find there none. Is it Labour&#8217;s intention, for example, to designate internet provision as a utility? Is it Labour&#8217;s intention to bring broadband to business parks? Is it Labour&#8217;s intention simply to provide broadband only where people say they want it, so that for the first two or three years of a Labour Government we would see a marketing campaign before any broadband was rolled out?</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/10">What are the Opposition&#8217;s positions on our policies? The hon. Gentleman lambasted us for not proceeding with the changes to the electronic communications code in the Infrastructure Bill, yet while it was still in the Bill, he was writing to the Secretary of State saying that Labour could not support it. The Opposition Front-Bench team has complained about the superfast broadband advertising campaign, yet now the hon. Gentleman claims that he wished we had advertised more.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/11">I am afraid that hon. Gentleman got his facts wrong when he said that we had moved the target. We had a target to get superfast broadband to 90% of the country by the end of 2015, and we have every chance of meeting that target. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I repeat that we have every chance of meeting that target. Then we set a new target of 95%&#8212;namely, getting to a further 5% of the country by 2016-17. That is not moving the target. The hon. Gentleman also said that we had ruled out wireless technology at the beginning; our approach has always been to be technology-neutral.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/12">This broadband roll-out campaign is an unequivocal success. We shall very shortly announce that we have passed the 2 millionth premise as a result of the roll-out campaign. That means 2 million households&#8212;millions of people&#8212;now getting superfast broadband where the market would not deliver. Labour&#8217;s alternative policy was give those people 2 megabits and then forget about it. Incidentally, Labour had no way of paying for it, as it had no policy to show how it would pay for this provision of 2 megabits. In fact, 97% of the country already benefits from coverage of 2 megabits, but we know&#8212;and all my hon. Friends know from their constituents&#8212;that that is no longer deemed to be enough. Most people now expect 7 or 8 megabits.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/13">Some of my hon. Friends talked about future-proofing. In 2010, we thought that aiming for 24-megabit superfast broadband would be the right policy, but technology changes all the time. Members will have noted BT&#8217;s announcement last Friday that it expects to be able to achieve speeds of up to 500 megabits over a copper line, thanks to new technology that it is trying out.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/14">In the past, we have been criticised by the National Audit Office for some aspects of our campaign. I have been robust in defending our programme against the NAO&#8217;s critique, and I am pleased to say that last week it praised the roll-out of superfast broadband. It made clear that we were close to meeting our targets, and were providing value for money. For that I thank the men and women who work for BT, including the engineers who work tirelessly to produce superfast broadband. Over the Christmas period, I visited some of them in</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/15">Steventon, which is in my constituency. More often than not, they exceed their targets and their reach. I also thank Chris Townsend and all my officials who run Broadband Delivery UK, as well as Bill Murphy, who had overall responsibility for the BT programme.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/16">I think that this is a programme of which we can be very proud. It is being delivered by a great British company, BT, and I was not going to come to the House and run that company down. Let us look at the facts. Superfast broadband is now available to nearly 80% of premises, whereas fewer than 50% had it when we came to office. The United Kingdom has a higher superfast coverage than any of the other EU5 countries. Our average broadband speed has quadrupled over the last four years. We have the highest take-up of superfast broadband in the EU5 and the lowest priced broadband in the EU5 and the United States, and we have the largest number of broadband users in the EU5.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/17">I understand the frustrations expressed by my hon. Friends, because those statistics point to the fact that we live in a digitally savvy nation, and British consumers want to use the internet. For example, they spend the highest amount per capita on e-commerce shopping. They are rightly demanding the provision of higher speeds and better service as soon as possible, but we are moving as fast as we can, and, as I have said, we are exceeding our targets and are well on track. As for value for money, the independent assessment review conducted for BDUK showed that, in the case of a range of cabinets, BT&#8217;s costs were 90% lower than those of a normally efficient operator, while the NAO reported that the average costs of a broad range of projects were currently proving to be about 25% lower than the estimated costs of bids for those projects.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/18">So what are the issues? I have dealt with the issue of whether we have moved the target, so let me now deal with the issue of competition. Time and again, people ask me why there is not more competition, but what sort of competition do they want? If we had organised a national bid&#8212;if we had asked a company to tender to provide broadband on a national basis rather than for 44 areas&#8212;what would have happened if BT had won? We would have had a national provider. Do people think that we should have done it according to regions? Who is to say that BT would not have won those contracts? The 44 areas were small, and were open to smaller providers should they have wished to bid. The fact is that BT won the contracts because it provided value for money. That has shown us how tough it is to build the necessary infrastructure, for this is an engineering project that requires infrastructure build-up.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/19">I will give the Labour party some credit: it did provide an element of competition. It had a digital region in south Yorkshire which went to a provider other than BT, and that went bust. We have had to pick up the pieces, and have had to write off &#163;50 million worth of taxpayers&#8217; money. That is the kind of competition that Labour provided. Nearly 95% of Cornwall, where BT won the contract under the last Government, now has superfast broadband speeds. It is one of the best-connected regions in Europe, and Cornish companies are saying that they have better broadband than when they go to Silicon Valley.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/20">The other issue is customer service. That involves maps, which pose another dilemma. On the one hand my hon. Friends say, &#8220;We want maps to show exactly</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/21">where people are going,&#8221; but then the maps are published and BT or the local authority get on the ground and they say, &#8220;Actually, this is not as viable as we thought and we&#8217;re going to move somewhere else.&#8221; That leads to disappointment. So there is a balance to be struck, but as far as I am aware now almost all regions are providing maps of up to seven-digit postcodes.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/22">Contrary to impressions, I am not the spokesman for Openreach and I share, as a constituency MP, the frustrations that arise with customer service. I cannot inform the House what proportion of bad customer service and good customer service there is, but we all know that constituents who get good service from Openreach are not going to e-mail us while those who get terrible service will, quite rightly, e-mail us and expect us to sort that out. I hold my hand up and say that I have had my fair share of people complaining about Openreach customer service.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/23">I also share the frustration about new housing developments, and as a result we have got the telecoms providers around the table with the major housing developers and we have put in place a system whereby new housing developments are flagged up to telecoms providers.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/24">Finally, the biggest point Members mentioned is of course the last 5%. Again, I absolutely understand the frustration of my hon. Friends, and all I would say is, &#8220;Meet me halfway.&#8221; We have never as a Government pretended we were doing anything other than what we were doing. We said, &#8220;We have the money to get to 90% and we hope to do that by the end of 2015.&#8221; The Chancellor saw how well the programme was going so he gave us more money. We then had the money to go to 95% and we will get there by the end of 2017. Then, to give great credit to the former Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40060" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Maria Miller)</phrase>, we said, &#8220;We want to get to the last 5%, but the back-of-the-envelope cost is huge&#8212;literally in the billions of pounds&#8212;so let&#8217;s do some research before we go back to the Treasury to say what it is likely to cost.&#8221; That is why we set up the &#163;10 million pilot projects: we wanted to get on the ground and see what new technologies could deliver superfast broadband speeds to that last 5%. We do not want to leave the last 5% behind; by definition they are the most difficult and most expensive to reach, but we will get there.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/25">Mobile is another huge issue. We have the fastest roll-out of 4G coverage in the world and the fastest take-up, and I hope my hon. Friends will recognise the superb legally binding agreement to extend that, which the Secretary of State negotiated with the mobile operators. By the end of 2015 we will have reached 98% of premises with 4G from the main operators, but this groundbreaking deal will see the geographic coverage over the two years after that&#8212;2016 and 2017&#8212;spread to 90% of the country, and it is not going to cost the taxpayer a penny. We have already pioneered it with the mobile infrastructure projects because we have prepared&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i>The hon. Member for Rhondda is misunderstanding annual licence fees. We have pioneered that with our mobile infrastructure projects because, again, we recognised that rural communities want mobile coverage, and we now have 100 sites ready to go.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/26">It has been difficult, however, and my hon. Friends mentioned the difficulties we face with landlords, who see this as an excuse. In fact I was being told only today</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/27">about a mast in the highlands that is damaged but which the company cannot get repaired because the landlords used its damage as an excuse to try to negotiate a higher rent. These are the kinds of issues mobile providers face up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/28">Finally, I commend the digital infrastructure document that we published today. We have been working in the last year to look at all the infrastructure networks the Government have a stake in, including the Network Rail signalling network, the emergency services network and JANET&#8212;the joint academic network for universities. We want to bring them together, to get that synergy that we have long called for.</p>
	<p pid="e.241.0/29">I rest my case there, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>

	<p pid="e.246.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity this evening to raise the issue of the need for CCTV to be installed and monitored in slaughterhouses, in an effort to better aid animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="e.246.2/2">I personally have been vegetarian for more than a quarter of a century, because I am concerned about animal welfare issues in the production of meat, and also for food and environmental sustainability reasons, but I recognise that the majority of people eat meat. However, I would contend that the majority of those people who eat meat want to know that their food is sourced to the highest standards when it comes to animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="e.246.2/3">Trainee slaughterers are tested to ensure that they know the laws relating to animal welfare before they are licensed, and yet when secret cameras have been installed in slaughterhouses, many of them have been caught flouting welfare laws, often in shocking and sickening ways. All too often, this cruelty is casually meted out to every animal that passes through their hands.</p>
	<p pid="e.246.2/4">The Animal Aid charity has carried out covert investigations going back as far as 2009. Since then, the group has secreted cameras inside 10 randomly selected UK slaughterhouses and found serious animal welfare breaches in nine of them. The latest evidence from a non-stun Yorkshire slaughterhouse was released to the media just this morning. It showed that the layout of the slaughterhouse was deficient and, in the words of the group,</p>
	<p pid="e.246.2/5">&#8220;was guaranteed to cause unnecessary suffering to animals&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="e.246.2/6">One wonders how that slaughterhouse was ever approved in the first place. The video from inside the abattoir shows casual, routine violence, with sheep being picked up by the ears, legs and fleeces and thrown on to the conveyor, or hurled head first into solid structures. It shows that the &#8220;surgically sharp knife&#8221; was often so blunt that the slaughterer had to hack over and over again at the throats of still-conscious animals. It also shows workers tormenting animals: waving knives in their faces; shouting at them; and in one case painting spectacles on the face of a sheep, so that they could laugh at the animal as she bled to death.</p>

	<p pid="e.246.3/1">I think every one of us was shocked when we saw the CCTV video and the pictures in the papers. I understand that in every abattoir there is an official veterinary officer who is available to monitor what happens inside the abattoir. They have to be of a certain qualified standard, but I understand that some of them are not. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that perhaps the way forward with this issue is to ensure that those official veterinary officers have the qualifications to observe and monitor the abattoirs, to ensure that these practices do not happen.</p>

	<p pid="e.246.4/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. The fact is that the vets who are on site in slaughterhouses are not everywhere at once, and too many incidents have been missed, as I will discuss.</p>
	<p pid="e.246.4/2">Proper training is essential, but having an all-seeing eye and independent monitoring would ensure the maximum quality of animal welfare conditions in our slaughterhouses.</p>
	<p pid="e.246.4/3">The recording to which I was referring shows appalling violence. The Food Standards Agency has so far suspended the licences of three workers, and I understand it is also building cases for prosecutions. Terrible as those actions are, that slaughterhouse is not, unfortunately, an anomaly.</p>

My brother is a farmer, and many farmers I have spoken to are deeply concerned that the welfare that they care about when the animals are on their farm is discarded in the final moments in the slaughterhouses<i>&#8212;</i>I received an e-mail about that just earlier today. I will come on to address the cost to slaughterhouses, but it would range from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand pounds. Given the scale of the industry, only a small amount would be needed to install CCTV across all slaughterhouses in the UK. I deliberately say the UK, because it is important that Northern Ireland, as well as Great Britain, is included.</p>
	<p pid="e.247.1/2">Earlier recordings revealed animals being kicked, slapped, stamped on, picked up by fleeces and ears, and thrown into stunning pens. They recorded animals being improperly stunned and coming round again, or suffering painful electrocution instead of being stunned. Cameras have also captured animals being deliberately and illegally beaten and punched, and burned with cigarettes. Workers have been caught hitting pigs in the head with shackle hooks, and using the stunning tongs deliberately to cause pain by sending electric shocks through animals&#8217; ears, noses, tails, legs and abdomens, and even, in one case, through an open mouth.</p>
	<p pid="e.247.1/3">The key point I wish to convey tonight is that not one of the illegal acts filmed was detected by the Government-appointed on-site vets or the slaughterhouse operators, who have ultimate responsibility for animal welfare. The current regulatory system fails animals badly, and I believe it is time to rectify that. Workers do know the law and they know how to abide by it, yet investigations show that it is routinely flouted when they think no one is watching&#8212;in which case, someone needs to be watching. Independently monitored CCTV could help reduce the number of vicious attacks in the first instance by deterring them. Who would stub a cigarette out on the face of an animal if they knew the illegal act was being recorded?</p>
	<p pid="e.247.1/4">Cameras could help prevent routine suffering by detecting institutionalised poor practice, such as the illegal stunning and slaughter methods used in at least four of the slaughterhouses videoed by Animal Aid. Any vet who saw these methods would have been able to step in and advise retraining for the staff involved. And, of course, those who do cause deliberate unnecessary suffering to animals are much more likely to be caught. The recordings, when properly monitored, provide evidence that will</p>
	<p pid="e.247.1/5">allow food business operators and the Food Standards Agency to take decisive action. Since Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals welfare standards introduced the requirement for installation of CCTV in abattoirs from 2011, all Freedom Food scheme-approved slaughterhouses have had to install effective CCTV systems and store recordings, and make them available to Freedom Food and RSPCA field staff.</p>

	<p pid="e.248.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is being gracious in allowing my interventions. Perhaps he is coming on to this, but will someone be paid to monitor and observe the CCTV? Will there not be a cost factor in that, too?</p>

	<p pid="e.248.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. The importance of CCTV is that what is recorded is stored for a period of time and then made available to independent inspectors. I know of a number of groups that would be willing to provide that service at no cost to the taxpayer because of their concern for animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/2">Let me return now to the RSPCA and the Freedom Food scheme. The two organisations have direct practical experience of seeing and assessing the issues associated with the operation of CCTV systems in a range of slaughterhouses. Based on first-hand experience, the use of CCTV in abattoirs is likely to bring many benefits to animals, inspectors and food business operators. Many of those benefits have already been realised in abattoirs that have installed such monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/3">The presence of an effective CCTV system in abattoirs is also likely to improve confidence among consumers, enforcers, the food industry and the farming industry that poor practice is being avoided&#8212;or at least is more likely to be identified and properly dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/4">One RSPCA farm livestock officer who monitors Freedom Food approved abattoirs, and who has many years of experience of viewing practices and assessing compliance with welfare provisions in slaughterhouses both before and after CCTV, said:</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/5">&#8220;In my opinion it has improved welfare considerably.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/6">The slaughter industry has not made a good name for itself. In recent years, the media have reported on: the deliberate adulteration of meat products with horsemeat; the scandalously high levels of Campylobacter in chicken; the theft of firearms from slaughterhouses; the use of a captive bolt gun to commit a murder; and a number of abattoir workers being killed or seriously harmed at work, sometimes through misuse of equipment, poor training or irresponsible behaviour. Add to that the repeated revelations of cruelty to animals and it is clear that there needs to be better monitoring.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/7">The supermarkets have already taken decisive action. All the major chains&#8212;Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury&#8217;s, the Co-op, Morrisons, Marks and Spencer, Lidl, Aldi, Waitrose and Iceland, as well as wholesaler Booker&#8212;now insist that their slaughterhouse suppliers have CCTV installed. This so-called &#8220;voluntary&#8221; scheme has led to a significant increase in the number of slaughterhouses installing CCTV. The latest Food Standards Agency figures suggest that 19% of red meat slaughterhouses have CCTV, which accounts for around 48% of red meat volume, and 29% of white meat slaughterhouses, which accounts for 59% of poultry meat volume.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/8">Although that is a positive step, a voluntary scheme has its obvious limitations. Not everyone will install cameras and, as was noted by an FSA board member, it is likely that those who resist installing CCTV are most in need of additional regulation and scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/9">There seem to be just three arguments put forward against implementing this much-needed legislation. The first is that CCTV cameras do not work because they were already in one of the slaughterhouses filmed by Animal Aid. My reply is that of course poorly sited cameras with no one monitoring the footage will not work. The answer is ensuring that cameras are in the right place, that recordings are kept for a significant period, and that an independent body, which is focused on the protection of animals, gets to select random or appropriate sections. There is no argument that anyone should view the recordings in their entirety. Clearly, that would be an impractical, onerous task.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/10">The second argument is that veterinary surveys show the same level of compliance in slaughterhouses that have cameras as those that do not. However, we know from investigations that vets do not see the commonplace abuse that takes place in slaughterhouses, so how can they report with any degree of accuracy on levels of compliance? The answer is simply that they cannot.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/11">That exact problem was highlighted again recently when the official number of recorded mis-stuns in slaughterhouses was made public. Vets in slaughterhouses record the cases in which the animals are not stunned properly and at the end of the year those figures are counted up. In 2009, those veterinary figures stated that there were just five mis-stuns of pigs across the whole country for the entire year, but in 2009 Animal Aid placed hidden cameras inside three slaughterhouses, one of which mis-stunned more than 99% of the pigs while another mis-stunned more than 10%. In 2010, the veterinary figures once again suggested that there were just five mis-stuns of pigs across the whole country for the entire year, whereas secret recordings measured 762 mis-stunned pigs in a single slaughterhouse over just three days. It is clear that vets do not see what is happening, which is why we need independently monitored CCTV.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/12">Finally, we come to the cost. The cost of CCTV installation is not prohibitive&#8212;it is just a few hundred pounds for the smaller slaughterhouses and &#163;2,000 to &#163;3,000 for the larger ones. Supermarkets report no resistance to their request that slaughterhouse suppliers install cameras. Although those one-off costs are low, there are various funding options that could be explored. They include individual slaughterhouses funding their own cameras, the industry funding them and the Government making available loans or grants. Although money at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is understandably limited, between 2011 and 2014 DEFRA gave more than &#163;900,000 in funding to slaughterhouses through the rural development programme for England. That sum would sufficiently pay for CCTV installation in every slaughterhouse in England that does not have it. In any case, there could be phase-in times and derogations for the smallest slaughterhouses to help facilitate the change.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/13">As for the cost of independent monitoring of the recording, there are options to be explored but we should remember that the taxpayer is already paying in</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/14">the region of &#163;30 million a year to regulate slaughterhouses, and that in terms of animal protection at least that money is clearly not working. It is much better to re-evaluate the system and use those millions to ensure that animal welfare laws are upheld.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/15">In conclusion, CCTV is a practical, sensible and proportionate response to a serious, widespread problem. It will not stop the suffering inside slaughterhouses, but it will deter gross acts of violence that were all too commonly recorded, help vets advise and retrain and help the FSA clamp down on lawbreaking by providing evidence for prosecutions, should they be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="e.248.1/16">As its obvious benefits are becoming more widely known, support for making CCTV in slaughterhouses mandatory is growing. More than 170 right hon. and hon. Members have signalled their support for it, whereas a YouGov poll of British adults last year showed that 76% support mandatory CCTV for slaughterhouses with independent monitoring. I note that a petition to No. 10 in support of the measure has now attracted more than 80,000 signatures. I therefore believe that this will be an issue that the House will debate again in the very near future.</p>

	<p pid="e.250.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" name="Henry Smith">the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, given that we have had the recent publication of the Food Standards Agency&#8217;s latest survey on animal welfare in slaughterhouses. I am also aware of Animal Aid&#8217;s campaign for compulsory CCTV and the revelations in the media today about apparent incidents at the Bowood abattoir in Yorkshire. In addition, I can tell the House that today we have published a report on CCTV in slaughterhouses by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee, which is an expert advisory committee to the Government. I have placed a copy of the report in the Library. The committee has been considering the issue for much of the past year and I am grateful to it for its input.</p>
	<p pid="e.250.0/2">Animal welfare is a matter on which DEFRA receives a huge amount of correspondence. It really matters to the British public and to the Government. From my personal perspective, although I am not a vegetarian, I was a farmer for nine years and it matters to me. When one rears cattle&#8212;when one looks after cattle, pigs and other animals&#8212;one wants to know that when they are sent off to market and to that end they will be spared any unnecessary stress or suffering, and that they will be treated with respect. That matters to all good farmers, to the public and to good slaughtermen, too. I will return to the issue of CCTV and the findings of the FAWC report, but first I will deal with the Bowood incident, reported in the media today following the release of secret footage by Animal Aid.</p>
	<p pid="e.250.0/3">I was first made aware of the Animal Aid video on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-06">6 January</phrase> and I asked immediately to see some of the footage that Animal Aid had made available to the FSA. Like many others who will have seen the footage, I found the films distressing and gave my full support to the immediate enforcement action that was being taken.</p>
	<p pid="e.250.0/4">The FSA acted swiftly to suspend the licences of the four slaughtermen involved. It also launched an immediate investigation into the incidents, and that investigation is still ongoing. One of the suspended members of staff</p>
	<p pid="e.250.0/5">was subsequently sacked by Bowood, while the remaining three are banned from handling live animals until the investigations have concluded. In addition, I can confirm that the FSA has required the immediate introduction to Bowood of an additional inspector to monitor operations there, and the cost of that additional inspector will be chargeable to the business. The additional officer will have full viewing access to all areas of the plant. Also, I recently asked our deputy chief veterinary officer to commence a piece of work with the FSA to review the way existing regulations are implemented and enforced, with a view to ensuring consistent understanding of what guidelines should be followed to ensure that slaughterhouses abide by the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.250.0/6">The report by the FAWC concludes that there are many benefits to CCTV in slaughterhouses, but also sounds a note of caution, stating that CCTV is no panacea, and while it can be a useful tool to complement existing enforcement and management, it cannot replace other management procedures and inspection regimes. It is tempting to conclude that the footage released by Animal Aid proves a point: that perhaps things like this would not happen if CCTV were in place. However, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, the reality is that the Bowood abattoir where Animal Aid secretly recorded its footage already has CCTV. The presence of CCTV did not prevent those apparent incidents, and the Bowood case is not the first example of apparent welfare breaches, including deliberate abuses, found in slaughterhouses where CCTV is present. My conclusion is that CCTV can only ever be part of the answer to improving animal welfare and preventing abuses. It needs to be backed up with other monitoring methods.</p>

	<p pid="e.251.0/1">I declare an interest as a livestock farmer, as well as my utter disgust on seeing the film of the Yorkshire slaughterhouse. I am a little concerned that many small slaughterhouses are already closing down, mainly because of the costs of regulation and supervision. Does the Minister agree that the introduction of CCTV should be proportionate, so that small slaughterhouses that have a good record on hygiene and animal welfare can be exempted, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40188" name="Henry Smith">the hon. Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)</phrase> suggested?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-02-03e.251.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40141" speakername="George Eustice" colnum="251"  time="019:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150203/debtext/150203-0004.htm#150203-0004.htm_spnew46">
	<p pid="e.251.1/1">I was going to discuss some of the options later. Earlier, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40433" name="Lady Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase> asked about costs. The FAWC has said that the costs can range from &#163;3,000 to &#163;10,000; that is the committee&#8217;s view, but other estimates are higher, at &#163;25,000. Clearly, it depends on the size of the abattoir and the number of areas covered by CCTV, but we do not think the cost of the equipment is prohibitive. It is relatively modest but it is none the less a real cost and we must be careful not to harm smaller abattoirs, particularly those that have good track records on animal welfare.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/2">As I said, the FAWC report states that there are benefits to CCTV. The committee concludes that it has a useful role in recording incidents, helping enforcers by enabling them to look at the footage to check what actually happened. It can also be used for evidence where welfare abuses are suspected. But the benefits of CCTV go wider than its role as a possible deterrent. For instance, it could allow observation of activities in small</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/3">or confined spaces where it would otherwise be difficult for the official veterinarian to observe. The report also concludes that CCTV can provide more accurate ante-mortem inspection in the lairage areas. For example, it is apparent that sheep may mask lameness when a stockman or a vet is present but behave normally under remote observation.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/4">CCTV can also be a valuable training tool for operatives to encourage sensitive and sympathetic behaviour towards animals and to spot any bad practices which could result in incidents or near misses. The report concludes that it is necessary to get the balance right between CCTV being present as a deterrent and a &#8220;Big Brother is watching you&#8221; device, and using it in a positive way to help train operatives.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/5">I want to say a little about the current situation and the uptake of CCTV. The FSA&#8217;s survey of compliance with animal welfare regulations in slaughterhouses in 2013, which was published last week, looked at the extent to which CCTV was already present on a voluntary basis in both red meat and white meat slaughterhouses. It is encouraging to note that the 2013 survey recorded that there has been an increase since 2011 in the use of CCTV, and that 43% of red meat and 55% of white meat slaughterhouses now have CCTV installed. By comparison, in 2010 just 7% had CCTV in the stunning and slaughter area and 8% had CCTV in other areas, so progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/6">Of course, these figures illustrate only part of the picture, as even those slaughterhouses that have CCTV installed do not necessarily have it in all areas. For example, red meat slaughterhouses tend to have slightly more CCTV in the lairage and unloading areas than in the stunning or bleeding areas. None the less, the trend towards increased installation and use of CCTV in slaughterhouses is welcome. Once we take into account the fact that the larger abattoirs tend to have CCTV and look at the throughput of those slaughterhouses, the results are even more positive. The proportion of animals slaughtered in premises using CCTV is approximately 83% of sheep, 90% of cattle, 92% of pigs and 98% of poultry. As my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley pointed out, the fact that 10 of the major supermarkets demand CCTV in slaughterhouses that supply them has, no doubt, been a factor, but I hope hon. Members agree that it is encouraging that much of the meat and poultry industry has reacted positively for calls over recent years for CCTV introduction.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/7">On enforcement, business operators are primarily responsible for the animals in their care at slaughterhouses, whereas the FSA&#8217;s official veterinarians are responsible for monitoring the welfare of animals at slaughterhouses. The report by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee points out that since the responsibility ultimately rests with business operators, they have an interest in ensuring that they do their job effectively. CCTV can assist them in doing that. I agree with my hon. Friend on some of the advantages of CCTV and that it can be a powerful tool. I welcome the increased uptake in CCTV, although I recognise its limitations.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/8">I shall touch briefly on the point about mis-stunning, which my hon. Friend raised. On the statistics concerning mis-stuns, the Government accepted last year that these were unlikely to cover 100% of incidents. Official veterinarians do not monitor all killing operations, and for poultry OVs can only ever record the number of</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/9">incidents, rather than the number of animals affected. It is important to clarify what we understand by a mis-stun. Previously, only major and critical breaches where the mis-stun caused pain, suffering or distress were recorded, along with the corrective action taken.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/10">Following questions asked in the House, I asked the FSA to review the way it monitors and reports mis-stuns, and it has now issued new instructions to official veterinarians which requires them to record minor breaches, such as where there may be a superficial concussion owing to an inaccurate position and a second stun is applied immediately afterwards. I hope that in future my hon. Friend&#8217;s concerns about the accuracy of data will be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/11">In conclusion, the key question that the debate raises is whether making it mandatory for slaughterhouses to have CCTV installed will improve animal welfare. The last time the Government looked at the issue, which was</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/12">in 2012, we concluded that mandatory CCTV was not the right way to go. However, I have always been clear that we keep the issue under review and that I have an open mind. I have just received the report from the Farm Animal Welfare Committee, which examines the arguments and evidence for the compulsory installation of CCTV in slaughterhouses. I want to consider its findings fully before reaching a final conclusion. As I have said, I will place a copy of the report in the Libraries of both Houses so that hon. Members can do the same. We have also uploaded the report to the gov.uk website.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/13">We have had an interesting debate. My hon. Friend, who has pursued the issue tirelessly since being elected, raised some important points. I hope that I have been able to address some of his concerns today.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/14" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="e.251.1/15" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
