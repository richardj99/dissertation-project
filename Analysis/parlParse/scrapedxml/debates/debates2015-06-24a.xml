	<p pid="a.867.7/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I will first offer my condolences, and those of my colleagues in the Government, in relation to the tragedy that occurred in Berkeley which took the lives of five Irish students. The pain of that loss is felt across the UK and Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.867.7/2">The Government are making progress on their obligations under the Stormont House agreement. We have legislated for corporation tax devolution and we expect to introduce a Bill soon on new structures on the past. I urge the Northern Ireland political parties to deliver on their side of the agreement, including welfare reform and passing a sustainable budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.867.8/2">Many young people in Northern Ireland have been given the opportunity to build a shared and integrated future through educational programmes for which there are substantial resources under the Stormont House agreement. Now that a waiting game is being played as the parties in Stormont must agree on other matters, will the Secretary of State update the House on the status of those initiatives?</p>

	<p pid="a.867.9/1">An important part of the financial package offered by the UK Government under the Stormont House agreement includes &#163;500 million to support shared and integrated education as a crucial means of building reconciliation in Northern Ireland. The financial package is of course contingent on the Stormont House agreement being implemented. The UK Government think this is one of the main reasons</p>
	<p pid="a.867.9/2">why we need to press ahead with the welfare provisions and the sustainable budget. It would be a huge setback for Northern Ireland to lose the rest of the Stormont House agreement, including the valuable funding for shared and integrated education.</p>

	<p pid="a.868.1/1">I do agree. We are working hard and the Executive are making a degree of progress with a number of their obligations under the agreement, but it is vital that welfare reform, which was agreed in Stormont Castle and Stormont House, is implemented. It is a good deal for Northern Ireland. The reformed system provides real help for vulnerable people and rewards work. It is a better system than the one it replaces. Under Stormont Castle, the five political parties agreed top-ups from the block grant that would give Northern Ireland the most generous welfare system in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.868.2/1">As has been mentioned, the Stormont House agreement contained a financial package of up to &#163;2 billion of additional spending power for the Northern Ireland Executive. Does my right hon. Friend agree that that represented a substantial commitment by the Government to Northern Ireland which, should the agreement not be implemented, could be in jeopardy?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.868.3" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" colnum="868"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0001.htm#150624-0001.htm_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.868.3/1">It would indeed be in jeopardy, which is one of the main reasons why it is very important for the Northern Ireland Executive to pass a budget that works. That will be impossible without the implementation of the welfare provisions. It is incumbent on every Administration worldwide to live within their means. The consequences of denying the deficit and spending money without regard to the consequences are extremely negative for front-line public services, which is why getting the Stormont House agreement back on track is essential if we are to continue to ensure public service provision is of high quality in Northern Ireland and vulnerable groups are protected.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.868.4" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10857" speakername="Nigel Dodds" colnum="868"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0001.htm#150624-0001.htm_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.868.4/1">Everyone in Northern Ireland and further afield agrees that the reason the Stormont House agreement is not being implemented is the failure of Sinn F&#233;in and the Social Democratic and Labour party to live up to what they agreed back in December, and to implement what they agreed and signed up to. Will the Secretary of State accept that this is now costing Northern Ireland &#163;2 million a week in terms of loss to the block grant? That is hitting vulnerable people, and imposing austerity and greater cuts, which those parties claim to be against. Does she accept that she must live up to her responsibilities and take action to ensure the agreement is implemented?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.868.5" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" colnum="868"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0001.htm#150624-0001.htm_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.868.5/1">I agree that every day welfare reform is delayed and every day Sinn F&#233;in and SDLP refuse to live up to their obligations under the Stormont House agreement costs the Northern Ireland Executive money. If the situation is not resolved soon, we will start to see a significant negative impact on Northern Ireland&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.868.5/2">front-line services, because it will not have a sustainable or workable budget without Sinn F&#233;in and SDLP living up to the commitments they undertook as part of the Stormont House agreement. I will continue to work to see that welfare reform is agreed and implemented, and the Government will consider all the options.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.0/1">Given that we are now into the period running up to <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-12">12 July</phrase> and beyond, does the Secretary of State accept that enormous efforts were made last year by community leaders and political parties to ensure peace and calm on the streets of Belfast and elsewhere? Since then, she has abandoned the only initiative that was in the offing to move things forward, and has not come up with an alternative. Will she undertake to look at the parades legislation? She has the responsibility for parading issues&#8212;it is not devolved&#8212;so will she come forward with proposals to move the situation forward and find a replacement for the current failed regime?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.869.1/1">The best way to take forward reform of parades adjudication is, of course, through the Stormont House agreement. I understand that the Office of the Legislative Counsel has been preparing the options for which it was tasked, under the agreement, for reform of parades legislation. I hope that they will be published soon. Alongside others, I will take part in the debate about what a reformed system of parading would look like and how it would work. In the meantime, it is crucial for us all to work together to encourage a peaceful parading season, where determinations are obeyed and any protests and parades are both peaceful and lawful.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.869.2" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10505" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="869"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0001.htm#150624-0001.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.869.2/1">With regard to setting the budget and many other decisions that need to be taken, is not the fundamental problem that the Assembly and the Executive were designed for the very good reason of bringing people together, but that that does not make for an efficient decision-making body? What thought has the Secretary of State given to how we might move forward to a position in which the Assembly and the Executive can take decisions on a day-to-day basis?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.869.3" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11500" speakername="Theresa Villiers" colnum="869"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0001.htm#150624-0001.htm_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.869.3/1">These difficult decisions on living within one&#8217;s means are more challenging in a situation in which there is a broad coalition and multiple vetoes. Where there is the political will, however, it is perfectly possible for the Northern Ireland Executive to pass a sustainable budget and implement the Stormont House agreement. That is why it is very important for the two nationalist parties, Sinn F&#233;in and the SDLP to live up to the undertakings they made. The Stormont House agreement was a good deal for Northern Ireland. It was rightly praised by Sinn Fein when it was agreed, and now it needs to get on and implement it.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.4/1">Let me reassure the Secretary of State that the SDLP has lived up to, and will continue to live up to, every detail of its obligations. I would be very glad to discuss with her any of the details that she has not understood. Although the Stormont House agreement achieved much, it did not fully complete the circle of the many issues involved. Will she define the Government&#8217;s position</p>
	<p pid="a.869.4/2">with regard to the Stormont House agreement? Are they active participants for peace and progress, or are they neutral observers?</p>

	<p pid="a.870.0/1">We are active participants for peace and progress. That is why we are fully engaged on our side of the Stormont House agreement and in encouraging the parties to live up to theirs. Obviously, a crucial part of the agreement is progress on dealing with the legacy of the past. That is another reason why I appeal to the hon. Gentleman and his party colleagues to unblock the questions about welfare so that we can press ahead with those institutions that his party championed during the Stormont House talks.</p>

	<p pid="a.870.2/1">I believe that the welfare reforms introduced by this Government are the best ones for the whole of the United Kingdom. I believe it is crucial to replace a system that has failed and trapped people in poverty with one that rewards work and caps benefits. I believe that the top-ups agreed by the Northern Ireland parties at the Stormont Castle agreement produce a useful and helpful addition to match specific local circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.870.3/1">Although we disagree with the Government on the bedroom tax and on their refusal to come clean on future benefit cuts, the Secretary of State is right to insist that these agreements are honoured without extra money from the Treasury. In the past, Northern Ireland&#8217;s leaders have earned great respect for making tough choices for peace. Does she agree that all parties must now accept that an affordable and sustainable welfare system is vital to securing financial and political stability in Northern Ireland?</p>

	<p pid="a.870.4/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for those comments. It is crucial for the Northern Ireland Executive to find a way to live within their means. They are not being asked to do anything that Governments across the developed world have not had to grapple with over the last five years. Their block grant has gone up a little in cash terms and come down only by about 1% per year in real terms. It is deliverable; it is possible to do this. The Stormont House agreement delivers a good deal for Northern Ireland, including on welfare.</p>

	<p pid="a.870.8/1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has announced that, from October, the national minimum wage will increase by 3% to &#163;6.70 per hour, the largest real-terms increase since 2006. The Government are also committed to increasing the personal</p>

	<p pid="a.871.0/1">The Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action has said that introducing the living wage would benefit 173,000 low-paid workers, giving them an average pay rise of &#163;1,300 a year. What are the Government doing to help workers in Northern Ireland, which has the lowest private sector pay rates in the United Kingdom?</p>

	<p pid="a.871.1/1">One of the best ways to help the low paid is to allow them to keep as much as possible of the money that they earn. The hon. Lady will be delighted to learn that, according to the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, average gross weekly earnings in Northern Ireland have increased by 10.2% over the past year. That is a whacking, massively great increase compared with the United Kingdom average of 1.7%. I am sure that the hon. Lady will be delighted to recognise that our long-term economic plan is working for the low paid in Northern Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="a.871.3/1">Like every previous Government, this Government have tried&#8212;and, in many instances, continued successfully&#8212;to deal with child poverty. Let me reiterate that one of the best ways of doing that is to make sure that works pays, and that people keep the money that they earn. To ensure that that happens, we have increased the personal tax allowance by 63% since 2010, from &#163;6,475 to &#163;10,600.</p>

Of course, a key role was played by the strike that took place in France. She asked specifically about what should be done. Let me answer very clearly that of course we want to see migrants better documented and fingerprinted, but much of that needs to happen in Italy, where they land, rather than in France. There are three things on which we must act. First, we need to work with the French to achieve better security at Calais. We have already invested &#163;12 million, and I am happy for us to do more if that is necessary. Secondly, we must work with our European partners to stop this problem at source&#8212;to break the link between getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe. Thirdly, we must do more to ensure that Britain is a less easy place for illegal migrants to come to and work in, and that is what our Immigration Bill is all about.</p>

	<p pid="a.878.0/1">The right hon. and learned Lady is absolutely right that the juxtaposed border controls on the French side are a good thing for our country, and we should be prepared to invest in them. That is what the &#163;12 million has been about, but in talks with the Home Secretary this morning, we have been looking at whether we can put more personnel and, indeed, sniffer dog teams on that side of the channel to make a difference. Also, more work is being done on installing fencing, not only around the port at Calais, but around the Eurostar and Eurotunnel entrance. All those things can make a difference, and we should work very closely with the French. There is no point in either side trying to point the finger of blame at the other.

	<p pid="a.878.2/1">First, what I said in that speech about robbing from our children was about the importance of getting our deficit down and not asking them to pay debts that we were not prepared to deal with ourselves. What we need to do is make sure we go on with a plan that is seeing 2.2 million more people in work. Crucially for children, compared with when I became Prime Minister, there are 390,000 fewer children in households where no one works.

	<p pid="a.878.3/1">Well, I am asking about robbing from children in families who are facing tax credit cuts.

If we really want to tackle the deep and entrenched poverty that we have in our country, we need to go after the causes of poverty: sink schools, high unemployment, debt, addiction and family breakdown. Those are the things that can make a difference. I was at a school this week on the outskirts of Runcorn with 65% free school meals, yet that school was able to achieve almost two thirds of pupils getting five A to Cs at GCSE. That is a better record, frankly, than that of many schools in leafy, well-off constituencies, so it can be done.

Crucially, we are seeing many more of the diagnostic tests that can find out whether someone has colon cancer or bowel cancer&#8212;about 400,000 more of those tests are being carried out.

	<p pid="a.889.2/1">Industrial action by striking French workers yesterday caused significant disruption at the ports of Calais and Coquelles in northern France. This action resulted from a dispute between local trade unions and the owners of the French ferry operator, MyFerryLink. As a result of this disruptive strike, the port of Calais was shut for a period of more than 13 hours and train departures were suspended at the channel tunnel rail port of Coquelles. Sadly, the strikers damaged SNCF railway tracks outside the tunnel, which led to the cancellation of all Eurostar services until 6 o&#8217;clock this morning. More generally, the disruption caused backlogs of traffic in the Calais area that presented existing migrants around the town with opportunities to attempt to enter slow-moving lorries.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.2/2">The French and UK Governments were well prepared for this event and tried and tested contingency plans were quickly put in place. Despite the extra pressure caused by the French strikers, Border Force maintained border security by following plans to put additional staff in place to search freight vehicles passing through the affected ports during the industrial action and thereafter. All freight vehicles passing through the Calais ports undergo searching by both the French authorities and the UK&#8217;s Border Force before boarding a ferry or train. During the course of yesterday&#8217;s disruption and since, Border Force and the French authorities have successfully identified and intercepted a significant number of would-be migrants.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.2/3">Last night, I spoke with the French Interior Minister, Bernard Cazeneuve. He was as grateful as I was for the strong co-operation between UK and French authorities during yesterday&#8217;s incident, and I thanked him for the French police&#8217;s efforts to maintain law and order in the Calais area. Our two Governments have been working closely and constructively in recent months to bolster security at the juxtaposed border at Calais and other French ports. Last September, Her Majesty&#8217;s Government committed &#163;12 million to that work. This has led to the installation of fencing around the port of Calais and the approach road and improvements to the layout of the port to speed up flows of traffic and create secure buffer zones for heavy goods vehicles. This is in addition to &#163;3 million spent on the provision of new scanners and detection technology to assist with the searching of freight vehicles and additional dog searching undertaken by contractors. At the port of Coquelles, we have already provided significant investment in upgrading perimeter security and freight-screening technology. We will continue to work with Eurotunnel and the French authorities on installing additional security measures at the site to prevent migrants from making incursions into the port.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.2/4">More broadly, the ongoing situation in Calais serves as an important reminder of why EU member states need to work together to tackle the causes of illegal immigration in source and transit countries. We are</p>
	<p pid="a.889.2/5">already co-operating closely with the French to tackle the organised criminal gangs that facilitate the movement of migrants into and across Europe. UK and French law enforcement organisations have already had considerable success in dismantling criminal networks behind people trafficking and smuggling on both sides of the channel, resulting in the prosecution of 223 individuals, and Monsieur Cazeneuve and I have agreed to build on this important work. As the Prime Minister and I have repeatedly made clear, the most important step to resolving the situation in the Mediterranean is breaking the link between migrants making this dangerous journey and achieving settlement in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.2/6">Traffic on both sides of the channel is moving again. There will, however, continue to be a significant border security operation as the backlogs of traffic are cleared at the affected ports. The inconvenience caused by the French strikers to the travelling public and lorry drivers is deeply regrettable. Though yesterday&#8217;s incident was caused by events that were beyond the control of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, our law enforcement organisations reacted to the events extremely well. I am sure the House will want to join me in commending the excellent work done by Border Force, Kent police and others on both sides of the channel who have worked tirelessly to maintain border security and minimise disruption to the travelling public. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.890.0/1">As the Home Secretary rightly says, the situation in Calais has been caused by a wider humanitarian issue across the whole of the Mediterranean and north Africa, which is in turn caused by hunger, civil war, political instability and the movement of people across the Mediterranean. Alongside the strike and the problems in Calais last night, the situation there has been causing problems for some time, as I saw on a visit in November last year, and it remains a real challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/2">Will the Home Secretary tell us what steps she is taking, following her discussions with the French Interior Minister, to ensure that the French Government assess, process, identify and take action on those at Calais? She has rightly said that they are the victims of people traffickers, but they are also in France and the responsibility of the French Government. Will she resist the calls from some quarters in France to end the UK Border Force presence at Calais, given that it is extremely important in maintaining the integrity of our border?</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/3">Will the Home Secretary tell us whether, at the European summit this weekend, the Prime Minister intends to raise the points he made at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions about the situation in Italy and southern Europe? As he and the Home Secretary have said, that situation plays a key role in determining the intentions of the people who come to Calais. Will the right hon. Lady also tell us what proportion of the &#163;12 million that she and the Prime Minister have mentioned has been spent to date? She will recall that the &#163;12 million relates to a three-year programme, and we are now in year one. I would like her to stop talking about the &#163;12 million and tell us what has been spent to date, and whether further resources are required to meet the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/4">Will the Home Secretary and the Transport Secretary advise hauliers, train operators and the public on the assessments that they should be making, and on whether</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/5">compensation claims could be made in the light of yesterday&#8217;s incident? Will she also ask the Transport Secretary to make an assessment in due course of whether Operation Stack operated as an effective response yesterday in southern England?</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/6">The Home Secretary has announced a new taskforce today. Will she tell the House more about its remit and resources, and explain how she would measure any success that it might achieve? Will she also make a further commitment to tackle the scourge of people trafficking through working with our European partners and their police forces? I would like her to make a commitment to report regularly to the House on the success of the taskforce in achieving its objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.0/7">This is a humanitarian crisis and the Home Secretary will have the support of Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition in dealing with it. It is important that we do so not only on behalf of those victims of the crisis, but for the integrity of our borders. The French need to take further action to ensure that they support us in both of those objectives.</p>

	<p pid="a.891.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions raise a number of issues. He referred to the fact that he visited Calais last year. Indeed, at the time he said of the problems of migrants building up at Calais:</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/2">&#8220;This is not new&#8212;we saw problems over ten years ago.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/3">That is precisely why the previous Labour Government worked with the then French Government to introduce the juxtaposed controls. The Le Touquet agreement was important and I reassure him that we certainly intend to do everything we can to maintain those juxtaposed controls. They are an important part of our border security and we will continue to work with the French authorities, as previous Governments have done, to ensure that they are maintained and operate well.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/4">On the issue of processing people, as my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister indicated in Prime Minister&#8217;s questions when asked about it by the acting Leader of the Opposition, there is a challenge to the Italian authorities. People are due to be processed and fingerprinted when they first arrive on European shores, and for the majority of those people that means Italy. My French opposite number and I have been working with the Italian Government and, indeed, other European member states to encourage Italy to do exactly that. The European Council will be looking at the question of Mediterranean migration, as did the Justice and Home Affairs Council that I attended in Luxembourg last week. One of the key messages the United Kingdom has been giving consistently&#8212;and others support it&#8212;is that the best means of dealing with the issue is to break the link. This is about ensuring that people see that if they make this dangerous journey, they are not going to achieve settlement in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/5">We need to work to break the organised criminal gangs and the people traffickers. The new taskforce is bringing together people from the National Crime Agency, Border Force, immigration enforcement and the Crown Prosecution Service. Some of them will be based overseas and some in the UK. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that they will be working not just among those British agencies, but with the French authorities and others, to ensure that there is better intelligence and a better understanding of where the gangs are and what the routes are, so that we can take appropriate action against them. I absolutely agree with that. It was this party, as</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/6">part of the coalition Government, that introduced the Modern Slavery Act 2015, which makes it easier for law enforcement to deal with human traffickers. Obviously, that is important legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/7">My right hon. Friend the Immigration Minister has had a number of meetings and conversations with representatives of road hauliers about the security aspects. We believe that, overall, Operation Stack worked well. The process has been in place for some time, but the Department for Transport will continue to look at it and about half of the &#163;12 million has already been spent.</p>

	<p pid="a.892.0/1">Obviously, none of the member states of the European Union can just take in the vast numbers of people who are fleeing here from poverty and oppression in Africa and the middle east. Does my right hon. Friend agree that the moral and practical dilemma is that it will not be possible for Italy, France or the United Kingdom simply to ship back to Somalia, Eritrea, Syria and other places where they face death and oppression men, women and children who have risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean? In addition to the very welcome steps she has described of EU member states beginning to work together, as opposed to trying to blame each other&#8212;it is farcical to blame the Mayor of Calais and the French for the present situation&#8212;is any work being done to try to identify, locate and finance civilized camps where people can be held in decent conditions while they are processed and not left drifting destitute to all kinds of places over Europe? While there, they can be processed and proper plans can be made for how to resettle them somewhere they can properly find new lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.892.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend raises important issues, but it is wrong to assume that all the people coming through those routes are refugees or have valid asylum claims. Significant numbers come not from the countries to which he refers, but from Senegal, Nigeria and other west African countries, for whom the issue is somewhat different. Many people who come across from Libya into Italy are economic migrants who are trying to get into Europe illegally and to get settlement. That is why breaking the link is so important. Those individuals should know that they should not make that dangerous journey because they will not get settlement in Europe as a result. It is also why dealing with human traffickers and people smugglers is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.892.1/2">Within the European arena, we are talking about the possibility of establishing places&#8212;we are currently looking at west Africa&#8212;where it is possible to return people. The other side of the matter is working in countries such as the ones my right hon. and learned Friend mentioned, using aid money, to ensure that we are developing those countries in a way that means we are reducing poverty in them, and reducing the temptation or incentive for people to try to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.893.0/1">While delays to cross-channel transport are concerning, as is the associated disruption, surely the bigger issue, which others have touched on, is the humanitarian aspect. Some of the migrants trying to cross from Calais to Dover are desperate. Many have gone through unimaginable suffering and are risking their lives in the hope of a better life in the United Kingdom. Many are fleeing countries that the United Kingdom had a hand in destabilising.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.0/2">We need to take our fair share of refugees in the UK, as we have a proud tradition of doing in the past, from the Kindertransport in the 1930s to the Ugandan refugees in the 1970s. Even Mrs Thatcher took some of the Vietnamese boat people, although not as many as other countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.0/3">The Scottish National party and the Scottish Government remain committed to assisting in this matter. We believe that there should be cross-country co-operation throughout the European Union. Will the United Kingdom Government accept the help of the Scottish Government, and participate in multilateral and collective action across the European Union, to deal with the problem of refugees?</p>

	<p pid="a.893.1/1">The Government are addressing the issue of refugees in a number of ways. First of all, in relation to those displaced from Syria&#8212;refugees as a result of what is happening there&#8212;the UK Government are the second-largest bilateral donor to the region in terms of the money we have made available for refugee camps. Many people are being given medical treatment, water, food, clothing and shelter as a result of the money we have given&#8212;it is getting close to &#163;900 million. We should be proud that we have done that. Given the number of refugees, they will not be accommodated by allowing everybody to move to Europe. Many of them want to be able to return to their home country in due course. Giving that provision in that area is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.1/2">In relation to Scotland and asylum seekers, it is open to the hon. and learned Lady to encourage local authorities in Scotland to take larger numbers of the asylum seekers that we disperse around the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.893.2/1">I, too, commend the work of Border Force, which has deterred tens of thousands of illegal migrants from coming to this country. Without its effectiveness, the French would have rather a lot more to complain about. If our border became known as a weak link, many thousands more would pour into Calais.</p>
	<p pid="a.893.2/2">What is the Home Secretary doing to bust the myth that the Home Affairs Committee has identified? Those people who are trafficked to Calais believe that we are some sort of El Dorado, where they will get jobs, benefits and support services. The truth is that they absolutely will not and that they will be illegal. What are we doing to bust that myth to deter people from going to Calais in the first place in the hope of coming here illegally?</p>

	<p pid="a.893.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is important that people understand what that journey means, what they will be coming to and the dangers of the journey. We have been working with the French authorities on the messages given to people who reach Calais about the fact that they should claim asylum in</p>

The taskforce has to work with the Governments of the Maghreb. They are the key to preventing people from setting sail in the first place.

She also said that Operation Stack worked well. May I gently point out that it may work well in administrative terms, but whenever it comes in, it causes huge disruption and misery to my constituents and thousands of other people in Kent?

	<p pid="a.899.5/1">Many of these people are coming from Italy. Given that Italy is feeling absolutely overwhelmed by the sheer weight of the numbers coming in, what specific help is the Home Secretary offering to her Italian counterparts to deal with those problems in Italy?</p>

	<p pid="a.900.0/1">The Home Secretary can be rightly proud of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the fact that there are now tougher penalties for traffickers, that it is easier for the police to take action and that a commissioner has been created. However, these are evil criminal gangs, equal in evil to the gangs that deal in drugs, yet we put in only a proportion of our resources for fighting traffickers and much more for fighting drugs. Can we look at that balance to see if we have it right?</p>

	<p pid="a.900.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. He is well aware of these issues from when he was chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on human trafficking and of the terrible evil that, as he says, lies behind this crime. We do indeed look at the balance, and I have asked the National Crime Agency to provide a focus on human trafficking. We should not think that the gangs deal either in drugs or in people: sadly, these gangs will deal in anything that they think will make them money. Many of them are therefore dealing in people and drugs.</p>

	<p pid="a.900.2/1">The Secretary of State claims over and again that the way to tackle the crisis in the Mediterranean is by breaking the link between travel and settlement.

	<p pid="a.900.3/1">I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has been misinformed about exactly what happened. I think that he is trying to refer to Mare Nostrum, which was not a European-wide engagement but one done by the Italian Government. Indeed, in the year Mare Nostrum was in place, more people died in the Mediterranean than in the previous year. There is now a Frontex operation, to which the UK Government give support. The Prime Minister referred earlier to HMS Bulwark, and it will be replaced by HMS Enterprise. There are also two Border Force cutters taking part in the enterprise of saving lives in the Mediterranean. The UK is certainly playing its part.</p>

	<p pid="a.909.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.909.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes that hospital A&amp;E departments have now missed the four-hour A&amp;E target for 100 weeks in a row; further notes that trusts are predicting record deficits this year; believes the pressures on hospitals are a consequence of declining access to out-of-hospital services under this Government, including fewer older people receiving social care and more people waiting a week or more for a GP appointment; further believes the increasing bill for agency staff is also adding to the pressure on hospitals; notes that the Government plans to stop the weekly reporting of A&amp;E data; believes this decision will make the NHS less transparent and make it harder for patients to judge the performance of their local hospital; and calls on the Government to reinstate the publication of weekly A&amp;E data and to set out how it will tackle hospital deficits in 2015 in order to protect services.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.2/3">I want hon. Members from all parts of the House to cast their minds back to the week commencing <phrase class="date" code="2013-07-14">14 July 2013</phrase>: the country was still basking in Andy Murray&#8217;s historic win at Wimbledon; England had just embarked on a successful Ashes series against Australia; and hospital A&amp;E departments achieved their target to see 95% of patients within four hours. Since then a number of unlikely things have happened: the then reigning world champions, Spain, have crashed out of the World cup in the first round; a group of scientists remotely have landed a probe on a comet hundreds of millions of kilometres from earth; and Cuba and the United States have begun to repair diplomatic relations. But in the same period some sadly predictable things have occurred: England have crashed out of the World cup in Brazil; they have been whitewashed by Australia in the cricket; and under a Conservative Government hospitals in England have now missed their A&amp;E target for 100 weeks in a row.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.2/4">I start this debate by paying tribute to the hard-working staff at every level of our national health service. They work tirelessly in trying circumstances, and without them there would be no NHS. Ministers have in this place adopted the practice of attempting to pretend that any criticism of Government policy is a criticism of the health service or its staff, so let us make clear one thing right at the start of this debate: NHS staff are remarkable and we are all in their debt. The achievements of NHS staff are despite Government policy, not because of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.909.4/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that question. If he paid attention to the Francis report, he would learn that it was not the targets themselves that were to blame for the Mid Staffs tragedy, but the way they were applied in that hospital. That is clearly stated in both the first and second Francis inquiries; indeed, it was a point that the Prime Minister made on the Floor of this House when he reported to Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.910.0/1">Why does the hon. Gentleman think that in my constituency A&amp;E targets have been met for 97% of patients, that in his own hospital in his constituency in England they have been met for 93% of patients, but that in Wales they have been met for only 83%?</p>

	<p pid="a.910.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that question. Had he been in this House longer and paid more attention to these issues, he would know that the datasets comparable between England and Wales are not actually the same. He would know also that the last time we had a Conservative Government people in Wales were waiting two years for operations, and that nobody campaigns more than I do on behalf of hospitals in my area on the waiting times there.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.1/2">In the past 100 weeks nearly 2.4 million patients have waited more than four hours in hospital accident and emergency units in England; almost half a million people have spent more than four hours on a trolley waiting to be admitted; and more than 1,500 have waited more than 12 hours to be admitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.1/3">Those figures offer a stark analysis of the difficulties facing accident and emergency. Even in this week of the summer solstice, this Government&#8217;s A&amp;E winter crisis shows no signs of abating. In a debate in January the Secretary of State for Health said that the NHS had just been through a tough winter, but the evidence from NHS England shows that accident and emergency departments have had two tough winters and are well on their way to a third tough summer. Under this Government accident and emergency is experiencing a permanent winter.</p>

	<p pid="a.910.2/1">My hon. Friend will know that Northwick Park hospital in my constituency has had some of the worst waiting times in the country over the past year. Does he understand, and will he address in his remarks, the fact that the ageing population&#8212;those over the age of 80&#8212;in Brent has increased by 50%, yet the funding available to cope with that increase has been reduced by 25%? It means that, of the 250 people who attend A&amp;E each day, 100 are dementia patients who become bed blockers because the integrated care package is not in place and is not working.</p>

	<p pid="a.910.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. He is right to mention those issues, which I will come to later. I pay tribute to him for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.3/2">The reason for those pressures on A&amp;E, in addition to the issues that my hon. Friend raises, is the sharp increase in people attending A&amp;E since 2010. In the past the Secretary of State has tried to claim that the increase is the fault of the previous Labour Government, but that is patently nonsense. Annual attendances at hospital accident and emergency units increased by 60,000 in the four years before 2010, whereas in the four years after they increased by nearly 600,000&#8212;10 times faster. The reality is that A&amp;E dramatically improved between 2004 and 2010, when 98% of patients were seen within four hours. This is a crisis that only started on</p>
	<p pid="a.910.3/3">the Tories&#8217; watch&#8212;after they made it harder to see a GP, after they started stripping back social care services and after they launched their damaging top-down reorganisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.911.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not think that the closure of A&amp;E at Crawley hospital in 2005, under a Labour Government, was distinctly unhelpful to A&amp;E waiting times?</p>

	<p pid="a.911.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has made that point on the Floor of the House on many occasions, and he has been a constant voice with regard to the hospital services used by his constituents. That was a decision made by clinicians in the area, and he will recognise that. He will recognise also how much the framework has changed and how much more difficult the Government have made it for communities such as his to have their say on health reconfiguration.</p>

	<p pid="a.911.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The point is not that there should never be any change in our national health service. When clinicians plan it and put it forward to improve services, we are right to support it. The difference is that the Conservative-led Government came in and attempted to close A&amp;Es from the centre, such as Lewisham A&amp;E, which they were going to close. They said they would not close Sidcup A&amp;E, but they closed it within months of entering government. That is the difference: the Government dictated the closures, not local clinicians.</p>

	<p pid="a.911.6/1">Is there not an extra pressure, with many trusts ending the year with deficits? Wythenshawe hospital, which is looking at a &#163;3 million deficit, has decided to try to cut 33 district nursing posts, yet when the Health Committee looked at winter A&amp;E pressures we found that it was important to hang on to district, community support and hospice nurses.

	<p pid="a.911.7/1">My hon. Friend puts her finger on the problem precisely. It is absolute madness, and it is happening at trusts throughout England, as their deficits edge up towards &#163;1 billion for this financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.7/2">The number of patients waiting more than four hours each year has rocketed by more than 1 million, meaning that there are now almost four times as many people as</p>
	<p pid="a.911.7/3">there were five years ago waiting more than four hours. That is a damning record, and based on the performance over the previous Parliament five more years of the same will see almost 2.5 million patients each year waiting more than four hours by 2020.

	<p pid="a.912.0/1">The hon. Gentleman may know that I spend my weekends working in the NHS, attending seriously ill patients. We are seeing more patients who are elderly, who have a higher acuity and who need admission to hospital; hospital is the only place for them. On his suggestion that the situation has arisen on the Government&#8217;s watch, how does he account for the Royal College of Nursing&#8217;s telling the Health Committee that the decisions that needed to be taken to deal with this demographic shift should have been taken a decade or more before my party entered government?</p>

	<p pid="a.912.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman wants to compare the records of this Government and the previous one, we will do that all day long and he will come out on the wrong side of that debate. On the ageing society, we would think from listening to Ministers and Government Back Benchers that this has just been sprung upon us. He is right to say that it has been coming for a long time, but we did an awful lot more to address it than this Government are doing. I will go on to explain why in just a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.912.1/2">A real worry for the NHS, and for those of us who use it or work within it every day, is the Government&#8217;s plan to suspend the work of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on its safe staffing programme. That move is a rejection of a key recommendation made by the Francis report, and in response to the move, Sir Robert Francis said:</p>
	<p pid="a.912.1/3">&#8220;I specifically recommended the work which NICE has been undertaking for a reason&#8230;I would not be surprised if this news generates a significant level of concern, and it seems a shame that the work of NICE has been stopped.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.912.3/1">That is the kind of magical thinking that afflicts Conservative thinking. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that at the last general election we talked about a specific &#163;2.5 billion fund to train 20,000 more</p>
	<p pid="a.912.3/2">nurses, 8,000 more GPs and so on. What we always said was that the NHS would get the money it deserves, quite separately from that &#163;2.5 billion, from a Labour Government. That remains the case and he knows that that is the truth. It is true that certain societal changes, including the ageing society, pose new challenges and offer new pressures for the NHS, but the service is also under increasing financial pressure as a direct result of Government policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.913.4/1">This is all a little ironic, given that in my constituency the Labour party went around petrifying local people by saying that the A&amp;E unit at Kettering general hospital was going to close, but it is still open and it is performing better.

	<p pid="a.913.5/1">If the hon. Gentleman is seeking an apology, would he like to apologise for the fact that A&amp;Es in England have missed their waiting time targets for the past 100 weeks? I do not see any trace of an apology or any scintilla of embarrassment on his face.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.5/2">It is true that certain societal changes, including the ageing society, pose new challenges and offer new pressures for the NHS, but the service is also under increasing financial pressure as a direct result of Government</p>
	<p pid="a.913.5/3">policy. First, the declining access to social care and the squeeze on primary care have forced people to turn to A&amp;E in increasing numbers and have also meant an increasing number of admissions that could have been avoided if people had received better care outside hospital. Secondly, the Government wasted &#163;3 billion, at least, on a damaging top-down reorganisation that nobody wanted and nobody voted for, and which was hidden from the electorate. That reorganisation sucked resources from front-line patient care. We know that senior members of the Cabinet believe that the reorganisation was a catastrophic mistake. We know that, in the words of British Medical Association chair Mark Porter,</p>
	<p pid="a.913.5/4">&#8220;the damage done to the NHS has been profound and intense&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.913.5/5">and we know that the reorganisation has not made the NHS more productive or more efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.5/6">Thirdly, the effect of that wastage has been compounded by the short-sighted cuts to nurse training places at the beginning of the previous Parliament. That means that there are not enough staff working in hospitals&#8212;that was a key criticism by the Keogh review. In addition to compromising patient safety and clinical outcomes, this Government&#8217;s decision has left trusts over-reliant on expensive agency staff.</p>

Does he accept that in every financial year since 2010 the NHS in England has had a real-terms increase in funding, albeit a modest one, but that there has been a cut of 8% by the Labour Government in Wales and the A&amp;E target in Wales has not been met since 2008?</p>

	<p pid="a.914.3/1">I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his knighthood&#8212;it is remiss of me not to have done that. He will know that real-terms increases and cash increases are not the same. He will also know, because he voted for it, that the budget in Wales has been cut by this Government by more than &#163;2 billion. Let us compare like with like.</p>
	<p pid="a.914.3/2">The Royal College of Nursing has calculated that almost &#163;1 billion&#8212;&#163;980 million&#8212;was spent on agency staff in the last year alone. Those and other choices made by this Government have meant that, collectively, trusts in England reported a total deficit of &#163;822 million in 2014-15. That is simply unsustainable. A recent survey by the King&#8217;s Fund found that 90% of trust financial</p>
	<p pid="a.914.3/3">directors and 85% of commissioners are concerned about the financial state of their local health economies, and that view will be shared by many Members on both sides of the House. An investigation by Pulse revealed that clinical commissioning groups were being forced to use their 2015-16 winter pressures allocations just to maintain regular services.</p>
	<p pid="a.914.3/4">Questions must also be asked about this week&#8217;s revelations that thousands of foreign nurses working in our NHS could be forced to leave the country as a result of the Government&#8217;s immigration rules. The RCN points out that this would cause chaos for the NHS and waste tens of millions of pounds&#8212;the Secretary of State laughs as I mention that. It would make matters much worse for patients and for front-line clinicians. Will the Minister tell us how many nurses will be lost from A&amp;E and how many will be lost in total as a result of this move? Where in the country will they be lost? How will the vacancies be filled? What will this cost? Has he or any Minister in his Department made representations to the Prime Minister about the effects of this policy? If so, will he share those with the House? When did Health Ministers know that this policy might cause so much damage?</p>

	<p pid="a.915.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Stoke deserves better, and no one has worked harder than him to ensure that it gets something better. Let us ensure that the Minister answers those points.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.1/2">The understaffing crisis represents a dire situation that will only get worse unless the Government demonstrate an understanding of these issues and give them the attention that they deserve. We know that, as well as deficits this year, the five-year forward view is based on assumptions that the NHS can save &#163;22 million by 2020. Will the Minister assure us that this will not result in any fewer medical staff or cuts to hospital or community services? Will he also commit to placing the analysis and the assumptions behind the efficiency plans in the public domain so that we can have an informed and honest debate about NHS funding? We do not want a programme of services being set up to fail and then being cut by stealth.</p>

	<p pid="a.915.2/1">I worked as a nurse under the previous Labour Government. That Government may have kept numbers the same, but they reduced the skill mix, which greatly affected the safety of patients both on wards and in outpatient facilities. Can the hon. Gentleman explain that?</p>

	<p pid="a.915.3/1">It is a matter of fact that we increased nursing numbers. The hon. Lady will be well aware that when we came into office in 1997, we were training 15,000 nurses a year, and when we left office in 2010, we were training 20,000 nurses a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/2">On social care, under this Government, 300,000 fewer older people are getting the care they need, with more and more people being forced to stay in hospital. But</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/3">that is only part of the story. When someone who needs care cannot get the help they need, it increases the risk that they will struggle or fall ill and have to go to accident and emergency. That is clearly demonstrated in the increasing number of older people arriving at A&amp;E by ambulance. Almost 100,000 extra patients over the age of 90 were brought to accident and emergency by ambulance last year. That is an indictment of Government policy towards older people, and the problem is further exacerbated when the true scale of the damage to social care is revealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/4">Before the election, the National Audit Office published its report on the impact of Government cuts on local council budgets. The report found that 40% of the total savings between 2013-14 and 2014-15 were made through reducing adult social care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/5">The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has calculated that a further &#163;1.1 billion will be cut from adult social care over this financial year, and the president of the association said:</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/6">&#8220;Short-changing social care is short-sighted and short-term.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/7">The number of patients ending up in A&amp;E because they cannot get the care they need to help them stay healthy outside hospital is clear evidence of this short-termism.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/8">Cutting the social care budget is clearly a false economy, as thousands turn to A&amp;E as a result. That is bad not only for the patient, but for the taxpayer. If a patient is not getting the care they need, their condition will deteriorate, which means that more complex interventions will be needed. A recent poll commissioned by the Care and Support Alliance found that nine out of 10 GPs believe that deep social care cuts are responsible for the overcrowding in our accident and emergency departments. The Government need to get a grip and address the crisis in social care in order to relieve the pressure on A&amp;E departments and GP surgeries. Instead, they have chosen to risk putting more pressure on the heath system at all levels by announcing further cuts of &#163;200 million to the public health budgets of local authorities without any idea of whether they can be made without harming vital services&#8212;services that potentially save money.</p>

Kettering general hospital will have not only an A&amp;E, but urgent care, social care and mental health facilities and GPs all on the same site. People can go to the hospital and be dealt with there and then, correctly. I will also have an urgent care centre in my constituency. Is that not the way forward?</p>

	<p pid="a.916.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I absolutely agree that models such as that and local best practice can exist in pockets all over the country. It is just a shame that so many health economies are getting cut to the bone, because that stops them from developing such care models. He is right that it is precisely that kind of integration that points the way to the future. Have the effects of these public health budget cuts on primary care and accident and emergency been modelled by the Department, and will the Minister share that work with the House? If that work has not been done, will he explain why? Has the Department consulted on these latest cuts, and what was the response?</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/2">I now wish to turn to the situation in general practice. In the previous Parliament, we saw a marked increase in the number of people waiting longer for a GP appointment. By 2013-14, almost 6 million people could not get a GP appointment. If the trend continues, that figure could be around 10 million by the end of this Parliament. Those people are often left with little option but to turn to accident and emergency. The GP patient survey suggests that almost 1 million patients went to A&amp;E last year because they could not get a convenient GP appointment. It is clear that the GP workforce crisis is a major driver of the issues under discussion today.</p>

	<p pid="a.917.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an extremely good speech and is being very generous in giving way. On that point, Stoke-on-Trent has traditionally had far more patients per GP than the national average, and the age of that population is rapidly approaching and often way past retirement age. What we are seeing is not that people cannot get an appointment when it is convenient, but that they cannot get an appointment for days on end.</p>

	<p pid="a.917.1/1">My hon. Friend makes the case. What is happening in Stoke, I regret to say, appears to be something of a canary in a coal mine for the NHS around the country, and its issues will increasingly be seen in areas all over the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.917.3/1">I have been generous with time, so I must press on.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.3/2">In 2013, the Government announced a call to action to improve general practice access and experience for patients. They set out six key indicators to rate the quality of access and experience for patients. One year later, every single indicator had shown a deterioration in performance. Fewer people described the overall experience of their surgery as good and fewer people were able to get an appointment. The Government must address that finding. Only by addressing the crisis in general practice in addition to social care can the Government begin to relieve the pressures on A&amp;E departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.3/3">When the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister discuss the NHS in this House, they like to use words such as &#8220;openness&#8221; and &#8220;transparency&#8221;. Sadly, their actions betray that sentiment on a routine basis. I refer again to Professor Keogh&#8217;s seminal letter to the Secretary of State two years ago in which he refers to the use and principle of transparency in the NHS as representing</p>
	<p pid="a.917.3/4">&#8220;a turning point for our health service from which there is no return.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.917.3/5">Except that, for this Government, it seems that there is a return.</p>
	<p pid="a.917.3/6">Currently, NHS England publishes the performance measures for each A&amp;E in England every week. Those figures contain a wealth of information for each trust and it makes that data available to the public. The data show how each A&amp;E department is performing across a</p>
	<p pid="a.917.3/7">range of measures, and it can be used to target specific interventions at trusts that are struggling. This reporting time period also means that issues can be identified quickly and resolved promptly. Rather than taking action to ensure that hospitals in England meet this target, the Government are seeking to hide the performance data. We will not be able to see how A&amp;Es are performing each week; we will have to wait until the end of each month. By publishing a significant number of performance measures from across the NHS on the same day, the Government appear to have found an innovative way of burying bad news&#8212;publishing even worse news at the same time. Patients deserve better than that. Clearly, Ministers find it more palatable to be reminded of their failings just once a month, rather than at the end of each week. This move is designed to make the red box lighter and the scathing headlines kinder. Will people not conclude that the monthly publication of A&amp;E data&#8212;unlike other monthly data sets&#8212;has nothing to do with patient care and everything to do with political and media management?</p>

	<p pid="a.918.1/1">I must make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.918.1/2">The issues facing A&amp;E departments, GP surgeries and social care services will not be solved by amending the date on which performance indicators are published. The public will be rightly sceptical about the motivations behind the reduced publication of data that illustrate both good and bad performance. It is a move designed to take the pressure off Ministers as they turn a blind eye to the pressures that they are inflicting on our health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.918.1/3">The pressures that the Government have introduced into the health service have built up until the system can no longer cope. A&amp;E is full to bursting and social care has been cut to the bone, which means that patients cannot be discharged, wards are getting fuller, there are delays for admission and more people are waiting longer for treatment. That is indisputable. In England, the target for seeing 95% of patients within four hours has been missed for 100 weeks in a row. Instead of easing the pressures in A&amp;E, this Government have decided to make it harder for patients to see the effects of Government policy on the services that they use by restricting the performance data that are available. Under this Government, it is getting harder to see a GP, harder to be seen at A&amp;E and harder to see how the NHS is performing.</p>
	<p pid="a.918.1/4">Not only is the record of this Government shameful, but their cynicism and complacency are, too. Professional bodies and Opposition Members have long warned the Government that the path they have placed the NHS on is damaging the service, working against patients&#8217; best interests and causing unprecedented professional concern. Having done that, the Government are now trying to evade scrutiny. Today, Ministers must explain why they are seeking to make NHS performance less transparent and to hide the damage caused by their policies from patients and the public, and how they intend to protect services and tackle hospital deficits this year.</p>

You will also have noted that there are several proposers of the motion, including the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Secretary of State and the shadow Minister for care and older people. My first question is why, on this important issue, which the Opposition seem to think is critical to their programme for the NHS, the shadow Secretary of State for Health cannot be here to make the argument himself. Further, we understand that the shadow Minister for care will not be wrapping up the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.919.3/1">I am not sure I get the gist of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point, but I do think that the shadow Secretary of State for Health should propose the motion in an Opposition day debate on health matters. I hazard a guess that there has been a disagreement between the two shadow Ministers&#8212;perhaps a suggestion that one of them is using health debates as opportunities to grandstand. I hope that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.919.3/2">I am slightly concerned that we are about to see another episode of the ongoing psychodrama which is the Labour party.

	<p pid="a.920.5/4">What I do not understand about the motion that he and other Opposition Members have put before the House is that, far from coming together and trying to build consensus on the future of the NHS, what they are seeking to do&#8212;once again&#8212;is reproduce the golden oldies of criticism that they put before the country before the last election, and that were so roundly rejected.</p>
	<p pid="a.920.5/5">That comment was about after the election. What I do not understand is what the shadow Secretary of State felt was the purpose of leading a campaign so politicising the NHS before the election.

The shadow Minister can speak warm words about the workforce, but he failed to congratulate them on their exceptional performance under unprecedented pressures. At no point in his speech did he acknowledge the real increase in pressure on A&amp;E services in the NHS. Some 3,000 additional patients a day are being seen, treated and discharged in accordance</p>
	<p pid="a.921.6/3">with the 95% target; that is being delivered by NHS staff across the service. He fails to point out the places where we have seen remarkable successes. He fails to give the example of Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, which saw a 16% improvement in A&amp;E performance times in the last year. That is front-line staff delivering better outcomes as a result of changes made by the Secretary of State over the past five years.</p>

	<p pid="a.922.1/1">As Madam Deputy Speaker pointed out, we have just had an election, and the voters&#8217; voice on the NHS was loud and clear. There is a simple point to make about the performance of this nation&#8217;s NHS: an independent think-tank&#8212;one of the most respected in the field&#8212;has rated it the best performing national health service in the world. It is better than that of Scotland, Northern Ireland or Labour-run Wales. A&amp;E, as measured by countries across the world, performs no better in any country than in this. If we wish to go to international comparisons, the shadow Minister would do well to accept the extraordinary work that NHS staff are already delivering to make this the best health service in the world.</p>

When a journalist contacted the Department of Health to learn the basis for that claim by the Secretary of State, they were told that there was</p>

	<p pid="a.922.3/1">The shadow Minister should know that we in this country perform best of all countries that measure A&amp;E, and that is the only way that we can judge this. The trouble is that by talking down that remarkable fact, all we do is denigrate the work of the people who deliver that every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.922.3/2">I move on to the financial performance of the NHS, the second point that the shadow Minister raised, which lies at the heart of his motion. Let me set the financial context. <i>[Interruption.]</i> While Opposition Members are giggling, they might like to remember that they went into the last election not willing to commit to the NHS&#8217;s own plan for the next five years. Only one major party pledged to give the NHS the funding that it requested for the next five years: the Conservative party. The history on delivery is clear: we are talking about an additional &#163;12.9 billion of cash in the last five years; a contribution of &#163;2 billion this financial year, and a further &#163;8 billion to fulfil the five-year plan. That is the financial background to this debate&#8212;a background</p>
	<p pid="a.922.3/3">that the Opposition refused to match at the last election. Money on its own does not get to the root of the problem, which I am afraid is not recognised in the motion, namely the relationship between quality, standards and money.</p>

	<p pid="a.923.1/1">It is a real delight to respond to my hon. Friend. It is a good thing for the shadow Minister and those living in England that they do not have to endure the experiences of people in Wales, which have, I am afraid, been inflicted on them by the appalling management of the Labour Government there, who chose not to invest in the NHS in the way that we did, in a time of constrained budgets across the public sector. I have to say to the shadow Minister that by concentrating on money&#8212;he cannot match the Conservative party&#8217;s commitments on that anyway&#8212;he misses the points around quality and safety, which are conjoined with money. If we go back to the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Opposition Members may groan, but they may wish to reflect on why Stafford hospital went wrong. It was within budget and was hitting its targets, yet at the same time it was killing people. Until that simple fact is remembered, and until we put quality and patient care first, we will not get the efficiency, as regards either care or money, that I am sure Members on both sides of the House wish to see.</p>

	<p pid="a.923.3/1">I am sure that the shadow Minister has come to the House without reading the speech in which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State directly addressed the issues caused, in some trusts, largely by agency spending, which took place because of the chronic understaffing created by the previous Government, and put right by us. That led in part to the catastrophe at Mid Staffs. The shadow Minister has not read my right hon. Friend&#8217;s comments about limiting the salaries of highly paid managers in the NHS, or his comments about cutting consultancy pay. It is precisely that kind of action&#8212;including enabling chief executives of NHS trusts to control their budgets&#8212;that this Government are taking to ensure that, nationally and locally, we are living within our means.</p>

	<p pid="a.923.5/1">I can guarantee that to the hon. Gentleman. On minimum staffing, it was in response to the Francis inquiry that this Government, in their previous incarnation, set the Care Quality Commission a specific target of doing something about minimum staffing. That did not happen before then. He understands that relationship between safe care and money. I just wish that he was able to explain it to his colleagues on the Front Bench, because if they went to the Salford Royal</p>

It is a great shame that that model of cross-party working cannot be echoed or reflected across the House. In that vein, I would prefer it if the Opposition had come here to talk about plans for social care. They have two competing visions for social care. We sometimes hear thoughtful remarks from the shadow Minister for care and older people, but then there is the shadow Secretary of State&#8217;s repetition of the phrase about wanting a top-down reorganisation of the NHS around a social care model. None of that will deliver what we all want: an integrated NHS and social care model, which is what we are beginning the journey of creating. We are doing that by reflecting locally what local places need in terms of integration rather than creating a national model to which they have to adhere. Again, it is important to fix all this&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.924.6/1">I will after I have finished this comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.924.6/2">It is important to put all this in the financial context. I have been through the Lobby with the shadow Minister and with many Labour Members who were in the previous Parliament. We went through the Lobby just before the election when we agreed to cuts in public expenditure in the first two years of this Parliament and the former shadow Chancellor committed the Labour party to cuts in local government spending. Difficult choices are forced on us by the catastrophe and chaos that we were left in 2010. Labour Members need to confront those difficult choices. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot, on the one hand, say that we need massive increases in payments for social care and, on the other, say that they are going to constrain public spending. The answer to that dilemma is surely to try to find a better way of integrating social care that I hope would see cross-party consensus rather than the politicking we have just seen at the Dispatch Box.</p>

	<p pid="a.925.0/1">My right hon. Friend never planned to close Lewisham hospital. I give the hon. Lady this promise: I will certainly come and speak to her about her constituency before anything happens&#8212;in fact, if nothing happens&#8212;because I care very much about the provision of secondary and tertiary care there. That also goes for my colleagues on the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.0/2">Let me give the facts of what we are doing in funding better social care and integrated social care in the NHS. We are already transferring &#163;1.1 billion of NHS spending into social care funding as part of the additional &#163;8 billion over the next five years. That money will be for social care as well as the NHS. It is part of an integrated system that NHS England envisages. Through the better care fund, funded to the tune of &#163;5.3 billion, we are funding the local integration of social care and health care. That will produce a different solution in Manchester than in Ipswich, and that is a good thing because those two places are different.</p>

	<p pid="a.925.3/1">I thank the Minister for giving way eventually, because he has made a number of points about my local area. In Salford, we are moving heavily into integration&#8212;we are one of the better places in the country for that&#8212;but the work there is not assisted by a number of things. The better care programme funding is not extra funding. A large hole has been created, as in Lewisham, by cutting back on social care funding. Even at a smaller level, the closure of walk-in centres in Salford and the ending of active case management as efficiency cuts are made have not helped. All these things are part of the jigsaw. All we have seen is cuts.</p>

	<p pid="a.925.4/1">Walk-in centre closures were supported by the hon. Lady&#8217;s hospital because that gave a safer service. I walked through the Lobby with her also. Because her party is unable to make a decision about money being spent on benefits and on the general budget for government, she would not be able to pledge any more than my party; in fact, she could only promise less funding for social care. She has to be straight with voters. Labour Members cannot have it both ways. They cannot spend money on the NHS, benefits and all the other things that they are pledged to increase funding on, and also claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility. It just does not hang together.</p>

	<p pid="a.925.5/1">I welcome the focus on integration, particularly in relation to social care. Enfield suffers from historical underfunding, with a lack of fairness in relation to the growing deprivation and age profile. We have made great progress, but we need to make more to ensure that there are winners, such as Enfield. That may lead to other parts of London, and inner London, being losers, but let us take these decisions now and make funding fairer, particularly in relation to social care.</p>

That is why it is so important that we concentrate the additional money that we are providing on local solutions rather than on a top-down reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.925.6/2">The shadow Minister spoke about primary care. He does not seem to have listened to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s latest announcements on the new deal for GPs to increase the workforce, support new buildings for GPs, and improve access through local innovation. We are trying to reduce the pressures that we understand are on GPs and that go back many years, not helped by the GP contract signed by his Labour predecessors.

	<p pid="a.926.3/1">I find it difficult to have to repeat to the hon. Gentleman, as I have to the shadow Secretary of State on a previous occasion, that this is a plan by NHS England. It is a plan that we supported before the election and afterwards, and a plan that the Opposition failed to support. The details of the plan have been worked out by NHS England and will be revealed in due course. Our part of the deal is that we provide the money that it has requested, which is &#163;8 billion. We will see the plan as it is revealed by NHS England. It is an ambitious plan but one that we will fund from our side of the bargain.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/2">The shadow Minister reveals in his comments and in the motion to which he has put his name that his motives are not pure. He speaks about the reporting targets for A&amp;E departments around the country, but does not mention that the decision to change the reporting standard was made not by the Government but on the basis of a recommendation made by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, who did so as part of a general review of reporting standards. When the shadow Minister talks about reporting standards, he does not mention that we are bringing those for cancer waiting times forward from a quarterly to a monthly basis, which I would hope he would have welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/3">The shadow Minister does not mention that, for the first time, we are introducing mental health waiting times, as well as putting into the NHS constitution parity of esteem, which was not in the original constitution written and instituted by the shadow Secretary of State. Those are two matters of vital concern to our constituents which we are correcting on the recommendation of Professor Sir Bruce Keogh. Nor does the shadow Minister mention that Sir Bruce recommends that the A&amp;E targets are brought on to a monthly reporting basis so that they can have clinical parity with all other standards and produce a better quality of statistical reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/4">In this debate, the shadow Minister finds himself on the wrong side of the clinical evidence given by Sir Bruce; the Patients Association, which welcomed the change; and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/5">&#8220;The move from weekly to monthly reporting better reflects meaningful trends and will in fact increase the validity of this key metric, by reducing the effect of short term and unforeseeable events&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/6">The Nuffield Trust said that</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/7">&#8220;the replacement of weekly A&amp;E figures with a monthly publication of indicators for many targets should help us understand changes in performance in a more meaningful way&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/8">The hon. Gentleman is on the wrong side of clinicians, academics, the Patients Association and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine&#8212;and on the wrong side of the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/9">The reason why is that the hon. Gentleman has made a choice. I appeal to the new Opposition Members who are sitting behind him: they can go through the next five years, motion by motion, vote by vote, opposing everything that is done on the basis of clinical evidence, just for the purpose of making political gain. If they do that, I, in turn, will remind the Opposition of the scandal of mixed-sex wards; the scandal of the highest hospital infection rate in the developed world; the scandal of a doubled pay bill for managers; the scandal of Morecambe Bay; the scandal of Mid Staffs; and the scandal of some of the worst cancer outcomes in the world. I will remind them of those every time they seek to oppose us for political reasons. The choice is theirs&#8212;or they can take the other tack and try to listen to clinicians, to be constructive and to de-weaponise the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.926.3/10">I will seek to do what the shadow Secretary of State claimed to want to do, which is to come together and allow the NHS to get on with the job of building 21st-century services. However, if the Opposition make the wrong choice, all they will do is confirm in the minds of the British people that they put politics before the NHS, and that for the Labour party, the party comes first&#8212;always&#8212;whereas for Conservative Members, the NHS and patients always come first.</p>

	<p pid="a.928.4/1">Absolutely, we have seen the performance drop across the UK. The Minister quoted a report showing that England was performing better than Scotland. I would be interested in seeing that one&#8212;where it is comparing like for like with core A&amp;E services&#8212;because those are not the figures I have seen. However, we all face the same challenge. We are dealing with older patients, who are more complex. The figures from Scotland last winter showed that we did not have a huge increase in numbers, but far more of those patients had to be admitted. Nothing else could be done, and we will face that situation more and more in future. The problem is that we are losing the staff to deal with that, and we are talking about A&amp;E, but in the vast majority of cases, they key issue does not lie with A&amp;E. There are two simple things: the number of patients coming in, which relates to out-of-hours GP access, and patients getting back out, which is described by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine as exit block.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/2">It is important to remember that the four hours does not involve someone sitting on a chair, waiting for four hours. People are often given that impression&#8212;that they turn up in A&amp;E and sit there, and no one will touch them for four hours. However, they will be triaged, see a clinician, have a history taken and have investigations. They may well get sewn up or be given something, and they will go home. Those patients are moving through. Our problem is the patients who have to come in, and it results in a whole cascade of issues, such as people stuck on trolleys getting the start of a bedsore, or families made miserable, or staff very depressed at trying to look after people in a corridor. It also results in people ending up boarded to any ward&#8212;any port in a storm&#8212;so that people are not in the correct ward and not getting the correct treatment from the correct team. We know that that, bizarrely, results in longer patient stays, which exacerbates the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/3">What we need to do&#8212;as we have done in Scotland, where we set up the unscheduled care action plan&#8212;is to work with all stakeholders. That involves looking at how patients flow through. It is not about people being</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/4">obsessed with measuring the target and counting it, but about people opening the gates in front of the patient. The data on how long patients wait should be automatically available to staff from their system; it should not require an extra body to generate that data.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/5">If we have the data weekly, which means we are getting them timeously, we can see one week from the other and ought to be able to see the patterns. The problem with monthly data for something that is identified as a currently acute issue is that, by the time they are collated, verified and out, staff may not remember quite what made that a bad week, whereas with weekly data, they can see whether they are getting a response to their actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/6">I support keeping weekly measurements, but I do not support them being used as a tool&#8212;and certainly not for beating one another across the Benches here. I can tell hon. Members that staff in the NHS feel that they are beaten over the head with these targets, so it is not about having a target, but about how it is used. In the paper released by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine here yesterday, one of its myths was that the four-hour target is a distraction. It pointed out that it allowed a focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/7">To try and tackle the problem in Scotland, we have ensured that the majority of our A&amp;Es have a co-located out-of-hours service. I mentioned before that achieving 8 till 8 in every GP practice is so far in the future that it cannot be reckoned on as a solution to this problem. We are unable to fill the GP vacancies we have now. Telling them that they will be working from 8 till 8 on Saturday and Sunday is not overwhelmingly attractive.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/8">The pilots that have been done have started to report in the last fortnight, and they have reported a very poor uptake. When people want to deal with an out-of-hours problem, they come to A&amp;E. Rather than trying to change the whole population, we could have a system in which people are easily diverted once they get there: &#8220;If you have this, please step next door to our primary care service.&#8221; We need to look at those solutions, and some are working quite well.</p>
	<p pid="a.928.4/9">The other issue is health and social care. To get patients out at the end of their journey, they need to be able to get into care. We need to remember that, although extra money may be given to health and social care through the health side, if we are cutting local authority budgets at the same time, we end up cutting the legs from under the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.929.0/1">The hon. Lady is making thoughtful comments and I am following them carefully. I agree with her that co-location can work in some places, but clearly it is not going to work everywhere. Does she not agree that most people who attend accident and emergency departments are neither accidents nor emergencies, and they would be much better cared for by general practitioners? To do that, however, GPs need to be trained for that case mix and incentivised for it, and most importantly, the public needs to be trained, too, about accessing the proper professional.</p>

	<p pid="a.929.1/1">Before the movement of out-of-hours GP services under the banner of NHS 24, most local areas had a doctors-on-call service. In my county, we</p>
	<p pid="a.929.1/2">had Ayrshire doctors on call, which was provided by local doctors at rooms in the A&amp;E departments in our two hospitals. Patients quickly learned where they could go to be seen quickly. We also had a car service that allowed us to make home visits. That functioned very well until NHS 24 came and pulled it away.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.1/3">We have to get back to local GPs working like that as part of a co-operative in a focal position. Each practice cannot generate enough GPs or work to have someone sitting there all day Saturday and all day Sunday. When the Secretary of State talks about 8 till 8, it is not clear whether he means that that will happen in each individual practice or on a regional basis. Most of the pilots that have started to publish their experiences have quickly made it into a doctors-on-call service. There is more common sense behind that approach and it is more sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.1/4">We have to look at the flow within hospitals. We should not have trackers running around bean counting when patients had what done, but people going in front of patients, opening the gates, looking at bed management and ensuring that patients are in the right place.</p>
	<p pid="a.929.1/5">All these matters cascade back on to staff. We are struggling to maintain and recruit staff. There was only a 50% take-up of trainees for accident and emergency, and we are haemorrhaging senior people, which exacerbates the problem. We need the co-location of GPs and we need to look at the exit block, not only out of A&amp;E and into the hospital, but out of the hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.930.0/1">A 25% reduction in the number of GPs and practice nurses has been forecast over the next five years. I have the statistics to prove that. People talk about the cost of agency staff and locums in hospitals, which is out of all proportion. There are also massive increases in costs&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.930.2/1">The problem with moving patients into hospitals is being exacerbated by the reduction in in-patient facilities. Every new hospital seems to have fewer beds than the old hospital it replaces. The Scottish Government finally accepted the view of clinical staff that that could not go on. We now treat people in a different way. People used to get a hernia done and lie there for a week. My breast cancer patients used to come in and stay for 10 days. That has changed, which is great for those patients, but there is an inexorable rise in the number of older patients who have complex needs. The problem is not that we are living longer. I get quite upset at the phrase, &#8220;the catastrophe of living longer&#8221;. I suggest that Members think about what the alternative is. At medical school, I was definitely given the impression that people living longer was the point.</p>
	<p pid="a.930.2/2">People are surviving their first major illness and, actually, their second major illness. They may present with breast cancer in their mid-70s to someone like me and have four co-morbidities. Such patients do not get in and out quickly for elective surgery, and they do not get out quickly when something major goes wrong, such as pneumonia or a chest infection. We therefore need to stop the downward trajectory in the number of beds, because we will not get the flow of patients if we go on cutting beds.</p>
	<p pid="a.930.2/3">For me, the key things that we need are the co-location of GPs; an out-of-hours service for out-of-hours issues that are better dealt with in primary care; and enough beds in the right places. Finally, we need to smooth the way of our patients to get back to their homes. In Scotland, we have free personal care that allows us to keep more people at home and stop them going into hospital and to get more people back out of hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.930.2/4">I commend the &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221;. Much of it is taken from something that was written in Scotland several years ago called &#8220;2020 Vision&#8221;, which was about integrating health and social care.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.0/1">I am not aware of the position on co-location in Scotland, but one barrier to the successful implementation of co-location in England is that the tariff and the funding mechanism mean that is it not efficient.

	<p pid="a.931.1/1">As I am sure the hon. Lady is aware, we have a totally separate system, for which I am grateful. We do not have a system of tariffs. We have a single NHS, so we can sit around a table and try to work out a solution. That is one of my concerns about the situation that the NHS in England faces and it is where I would veer away from the &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.1/2">The principle of working together and integrating health and social care is commendable. The integration boards in Scotland started work in April because &#8220;2020 Vision&#8221; is a few years older than the &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221;, but we face the same challenge: local authorities are struggling with their budgets, which can end up eating away at the health side.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.1/3">The four-hour target is still useful as a weekly target to provide a quick response to what is going on in our hospitals. However, it should not be used as a stick to beat staff or to beat ourselves in this House and make public capital. The NHS is too precious for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25318" name="Philippa Whitford">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)</phrase>. The House should listen to what she says about the point of targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.2/2">I thank NHS staff across the UK and, given the subject of this debate, particularly those who work in the 181 emergency departments across England. Those people face immense challenges. Last year, they cared for 14.5 million patients&#8212;an increase of 500,000 on the previous year. As the hon. Lady said, this debate is about not just numbers, but complexity. We have to face that. It is a disappointment to those NHS staff when they see the debate descend into political diatribes. They want to hear constructive diagnoses and solutions from this House; they do not want to see this issue being used as a football. Let us move forward in that vein in this debate and look at the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.2/3">This issue is immensely complex. Anyone who says that there is a single answer is not looking at the scale of the problem. In the few minutes I have, it would be impossible to address all the issues, so I will focus on the workforce challenge, which is key. That challenge does not relate just to emergency departments; there is a complex interaction that includes primary care, ambulance services and the voluntary sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.2/4">We know that about 15% to 20% of people who are seen in emergency departments would be better seen in another context. How do we get the skill mix right? We need to consider the fact that not every place needs the same solutions. The solutions that are right in a rural constituency are very different from the solutions that are right in an urban area.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.2/5">We need to look at the challenges of recruitment, retention and retirement. We have heard that 50% of training places are not being filled, but there is also the leaky bucket of those leaving the profession. We must consider the fact that it costs about &#163;600,000 to train someone to senior registrar level in emergency care. The scale of the brain drain is enormous, particularly to Australia and New Zealand. How do we address that? Of course, there will always be junior doctors who want to spend a year working abroad and then return with the skills that they acquire. We should not discourage that, but we could do more to make it a two-way process. The main problem is the loss of those higher professionals who have not only the skills that are needed to look after the most unwell patients in our emergency departments, but the confidence and decision-making skills that are required to know when it is safe for patients to go home.</p>

	<p pid="a.932.1/1">Indeed. I was going to comment further on the issue of the skill mix. This is about not only those higher skill professionals, but the mix within the NHS. I do not think that we should talk that down. We simply will not be able to manage unless we broaden the skill mix. Healthcare assistants, for example, make an extraordinary contribution to the NHS and social care. One of the reasons we lose so many of them is the lack of access to higher professional development; it is not just about a low-wage economy. This is about how we can create more pathways to becoming, for example, assistant practitioners and physician assistants, how we can use them and how we can bring in more pharmacists, who train for five years in their specialty, into what we do across the NHS?</p>

	<p pid="a.932.3/1">It is a huge opportunity and we must go further with that, because continuing professional development across the NHS workforce is part of addressing the burnout that the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire talked about. We must do more to address the rotas and see what is causing our staff to leave the NHS, because it is not just about pay or the allure of working in a sunnier climate&#8212;we cannot do much about that. It is also often about the work-life balance they face and how that compares with abroad. We have got into a vicious circle of increasingly having to rely on locums to fill those gaps, and that money could be far better spent addressing why the NHS is haemorrhaging so many skilled staff abroad and to outside professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.3/2">When we talk in this House about the challenges facing primary care and A&amp;E departments, we must be careful not to talk them down. We know that medical students find going into A&amp;E attractive, so let us not cut off the supply any further by talking about it in terms of doom and gloom. There are things we can do to improve the working lives of people in A&amp;E, so we should get on and do the job, and I think that this House should do so in a far more constructive frame of mind. It is time to put aside the difference we have had in the election. We have five years to go until the next election. Let us show an example to those following this debate outside by looking at this in entirely constructive terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.3/3">I want to return to an issue the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire touched on: seven-day working. Just as we should not be trapped by targets, let us not be trapped by political dogma. Let us look at what the unintended consequences sometimes can be if we are driven by the mantra that it must be 8 till 8 and seven days a week in every situation. I used to practise in a rural community. If we create a system in which we make it deeply unattractive to work in small, rural practices and in which we divert resources from the key priorities of seven-day working&#8212;which should be to reduce avoidable mortality and unnecessary hospital admissions&#8212;and if we take our eyes off that as the key priority and drive towards having to achieve 8 till 8 in every location, we could find that we have a further recruitment shortfall, as has happened in my constituency. That can translate into real unintended harms, such as the closure of many beds at Brixham hospital because the GPs could no longer safely man the in-patient beds. We could find ourselves in a spiral of unintended consequences. Let us listen to those on the front line and to our patients and keep them first and foremost in our minds when we consider what we are doing in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.933.0/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker; it is an exceptional pleasure to speak while you are in the Chair. I hope that I will be forgiven for returning to the motion, which seems to have slipped Members&#8217; minds over the past hour or so. It specifically states:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/2">&#8220;That this House notes that hospital A&amp;E departments have now missed the four-hour A&amp;E target for 100 weeks in a row; further notes that trusts are predicting record deficits this year&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/3">The Government were asked to respond to that. As the Minister singularly failed to do so at the start of the debate, I hope that he will return to it in closing.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/4">I have in my patch the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, where I first met a heart surgeon call Sir Bruce Keogh&#8212;I am not entirely sure what happened to him. I therefore have either the highest or the second highest proportion of constituents who are either doctors or who work in the health service, so the NHS and everything associated with it is something that I cannot escape. I thought that it would be useful to have an NHS tracker survey, which records over a period of time how the health service is seen not just by those who use it, but by those who work in it. I want briefly to share the results of the surveys with the</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/5">House, because they show that the people who use the NHS and who work in it are becoming increasingly concerned about the conditions in which they are treated or in which they work.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/6">I received about 400 responses to the last survey. Some 74% of respondents said that they were very concerned about the future of the NHS. One respondent commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/7">&#8220;I work in a large university hospital Emergency Department&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/8">We have a number of large trusts in the west midlands conurbation, so people might be living in my constituency but working in a different trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/9">&#8220;The hospital bed occupancy consistently exceeds 99%, with hundreds of well patients in beds unable to be discharged due to inadequate social care. Consequently, the A&amp;E is overwhelmed with patients lying on trolleys while I scrabble around trying to get something done.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/10">Another respondent said:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/11">&#8220;My work load leaves me worrying about my own health in the future.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/12">Another referred to</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/13">&#8220;staff shortage on wards leading to the use of more agency staff, wasting money on unnecessary management&#8230; staff are stressed due to doing more shifts to make ends meet.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/14">Another said:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/15">&#8220;All parties want better 24-hour access but there are not enough trained doctors&#8212;especially GPs&#8212;coming through the system, and too much money is spent on bank staff and locums.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/16">That is not political scaremongering; that is what people who work in the health service have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/17">We have face up to that. It is no good sitting here and pretending that we have no control over it. Decisions on the NHS are political decisions, because we decide annually how much money to spend on it. That means that there has to be some element of control. University Hospitals Birmingham has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/18">&#8220;Emergency Department activity has continued to rise with the Trust passing the 102,000 ED attendances a year&#8230; equating to a 4.9% increase&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/19">Those are enormous numbers&#8212;102,000 emergency admissions in one hospital&#8212;and they are going up year on year.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/20">That brings me to the targets. I know that they are difficult, but I remember that when we introduced them they were about the only way we could get good consultants to change their way of doing things. They kept saying, &#8220;This is the only way of doing it,&#8221; so we said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s try with targets.&#8221; If we look at the most recent statistics on waiting times of four hours or less in the west midlands, we see that Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust has achieved 95%; University Hospitals Birmingham has achieved 95%; but University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust achieved 79%; Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust achieved 81%; and the University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust achieved 87%. That tells us that something is going on that is not quite right. I think that we ought to start debates such as this one by saying, &#8220;Both sides agree that something is going on that is not quite right.&#8221; These figures are not just inventions. They tell us the trend, so how do we address it?</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/21">The Government got rid of NHS Direct, and 111 did not replace it&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is no good the Minister shaking his head. I set up NHS Direct, and the big thing was that there were trained nurses, not call handlers.</p>
	<p pid="a.933.0/22">They managed to deal with demand because the person on the other end of the phone could make a clinical decision, not just pass it on. We have had those knock-on effects. I hope that at least at some stage over the next two hours the motion on the Order Paper will be addressed. The trend is in the wrong direction and we need to think about what to do about it. People are waiting longer and the hospital deficits will be horrendous. This will be a problem for us all.</p>

	<p pid="a.935.0/1">It is a delight to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10577" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase>, who made some very interesting points. When I read the motion, what struck me most was that if I had read it having just stepped off the Mars to Earth express, I would have believed that Britain&#8217;s national health service was a total disaster and that nothing was being done to improve the services that were being delivered. Yes, there are still problems in the NHS, particularly in lots of our larger general hospitals, such as Medway Maritime Hospital, which provides services for my constituency, including A&amp;E cover. Medway Maritime has faced big challenges for a number of years, including under the previous Labour Government, and among those challenges was a failing A&amp;E department. There were a number of reasons for the challenges, including the limitations of the site on which it is located and the demography of Medway towns in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.935.0/2">Last year, those challenges came to a head and Medway Maritime was put into special measures. Following the appointment of a new chief executive and new trust chairwoman and with the buddying arrangements that have seen Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; NHS Foundation Trust provide Medway with advice and expertise, the hospital is beginning to see some improvement. Of course, much more needs to be done before Medway Maritime can provide my constituents with the health service they deserve and to which they are entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.935.0/3">There is general agreement that one way to relieve the pressure on the hospital is to transfer more of the services it provides into the community. In my constituency, I have two excellent community hospitals, Sittingbourne Memorial Hospital and Sheppey Community Hospital. They both provide local people with a very good service, albeit for a limited range of healthcare needs. I would like the services they provide to be expanded. Okay, we will never see a fully fledged accident and emergency department in Sittingbourne and Sheppey, but there is no reason why my two community hospitals cannot provide other services. Today&#8217;s Opposition motion contains the statement that</p>
	<p pid="a.935.0/4">&#8220;the pressures on hospitals are a consequence of declining access to out-of-hospital services&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.935.0/5">There are a number of things going on in my neck of the woods that belie that statement, with a number of initiatives and pilots taking place that in the long-term will benefit not only my constituency but the wider NHS. Let me tell Members about a couple of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.935.0/6">Last week, I met managers from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, SECAMB, who told me about the vanguard initiative in which they are involved in Whitstable, just outside my constituency. It is one of several initiatives nationwide that will provide specialist out-of-hospital care in the local community and involves</p>
	<p pid="a.935.0/7">a SECAMB paramedic team, led by a specialist paramedic, working with local GPs to provide people with home treatment rather than their being taken to hospital. SECAMB is keen to replicate the model in other areas, including the Isle of Sheppey in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.936.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that with home treatments, the patient becomes the patient expert, which is another way of moving forward local solutions and the community helping itself?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.936.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24828" speakername="Gordon Henderson" colnum="936"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0002.htm#150624-0002.htm_spnew114">
	<p pid="a.936.1/1">I very much agree, and I shall come onto that point in a moment. I am interested in getting that model on the Isle of Sheppey and I hope that NHS England will see the merit in the initiative and provide SECAMB with the necessary funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.1/2">I mentioned earlier the excellent Sittingbourne Memorial Hospital in my constituency. It, too, is running a pilot that I believe should be extended into other areas. Last December, a wound medicine centre was opened in the Memorial. It is a specialist service for patients across Swale who have chronic, complex or surgical wounds and it is operated under the care of the Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust. The centre uses telemedicine, with community nurses visiting patients in their home. By using mobile computer tablets to photograph wounds, nurses can send pictures back to specialists based at Sittingbourne Memorial to provide an instant professional opinion. The system can also track the progress of healing wounds and use the data to work out the best treatment options, including the correct type of dressing. That has the potential to save the NHS thousands of pounds in the wasted procurement of unnecessary dressings.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.1/3">Last month, I was honoured to open the HEM ultrasound clinic in my constituency. It is a new unit that provides a wide range of ultrasound scans and is the first static clinical ultrasound service in Medway and west Kent. Although it is a private clinic, it is just been contracted to Medway Maritime to help bring down its waiting lists. HEM is undertaking an average of 35 scans on behalf of the hospital every day, seven days a week. The cost to the NHS of the clinic&#8217;s service is the same as if the hospital undertook the scans itself. Let me tell those who accuse the Government of wanting to privatise the NHS that using facilities such as HEM is not about privatising the NHS but about the sensible use of private facilities to supplement NHS treatment and reduce waiting times for worried men and women.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.1/4">I want to mention one particular concern. My local Swale clinical commissioning group is led by an excellent team whose members are fully committed to providing local people with more local services to reduce pressure on Medway Maritime, but Swale CCG is one of the smallest in the country and its size presented big challenges, as does the historic health deprivation in some of the wards in my constituency. Last year, Swale CCG received an above-average increase in its budget and I want to take this opportunity to urge the Government to ensure that it receives an above-average increase again this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.936.2/1">It is the ultimate honour to be here today to deliver my maiden speech as the Member of Parliament for Dewsbury, Mirfield,</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/2">Denby Dale and Kirkburton. To every man, woman and child living in my wonderful constituency, I promise to be their champion and stand up for them at every opportunity. I warmly congratulate my fellow new Members on their excellent and eloquent contributions and I continue to enjoy my whistle-stop tour of the UK through their speeches. In keeping with tradition, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the input of my predecessor Simon Reevell, and I wish him well for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/3">The suffragette movement fascinated and inspired me from a young age and visiting the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in order to be included in the census as a resident of this building reminded me of the ongoing struggle that women have both in society and in politics. It is refreshing that 65% of the new Labour intake are female, but there is a lot more to do and I look forward to contributing to that cause. As James Brown famously sang, &#8220;It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world, but it ain&#8217;t nothing without a woman or a girl.&#8221; It is therefore a particular privilege to be the first female MP elected in the constituency since Ann Taylor, who now sits in the other place. Every corner of the constituency still holds great affection for Ann for both her unstinting commitment and her no-nonsense approach. I have big shoes to fill and I thank Ann for the generosity of her advice and support. I aspire to make her proud. On the subject of inspirational women it would be remiss of me not to mention Betty Boothroyd, born in Dewsbury, the daughter of textile workers, who broke new ground by becoming the first woman to be elected as one of Mr Speaker&#8217;s predecessors.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/4">The Dewsbury constituency is a wonderful place in which to live, work and indeed play. Dewsbury itself is often referred to as the heavy woollen district, a nod to the manufacture of heavyweight cloth that saw a significant population of South Asian origin relocate there in the late 1950s, many of Kashmiri and Gujarati heritage. Indeed, the town maintains a rich manufacturing industry and has something of a monopoly in the bed and mattress industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/5">In common with many other northern market towns, Dewsbury is struggling economically, with the town centre crying out for regeneration. It is therefore most welcome that Dewsbury has been earmarked as an enterprise zone. Dewsbury is also famous for its hospitality and the warmth of its welcome. It is perhaps unique in that, when visiting a constituent&#8217;s home intending to stay a short time, I can be greeted with a three-course banquet and an invitation to the family wedding. Many people will have shed a tear watching Mushy overcome his stammer on &#8220;Educating Yorkshire&#8221;, the fly-on-the-wall documentary filmed at Dewsbury&#8217;s own Thornhill Academy.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/6">The town of Mirfield has strong socialist roots. The Community of the Resurrection, an Anglican religious community for men, was founded there in 1898 and hosted Keir Hardie and Emmeline Pankhurst in its incredible outdoor amphitheatre. Denby Dale and Kirkburton comprise a number of small villages and arguably boast some of the finest scenery in Yorkshire&#8212;or God&#8217;s own county, as it is better known. I always know I am near home when I catch sight of the splendid Emley Moor mast, which, at 1,084 feet, is the tallest free-standing structure in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/7">Many will know that I am a trade unionist, having previously acted as a shop steward and equalities officer. I will continue to seek to strengthen the bond between the Labour party and the trade union movement. The trade unions were instrumental in creating the Labour party to fight for working people in Parliament, and in this time of insecure employment, zero-hours contracts and exploitative labour, the unions have never been needed more in the workplace, just as the voice of working people has never been more needed in Parliament. This Government&#8217;s shameful attempt to weaken that collective voice should be universally condemned throughout this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/8">I must also acknowledge my parents, Barbara and Michael, who taught me that I did not have to go to university to achieve my dreams and that I should maintain the courage of my convictions and never give up on my principles. I am proud to bring over 20 years&#8217; experience on the front line of our public services to this Parliament. After some time working with the victims of crime, I worked in a front-line healthcare role for 13 years prior to taking my seat in this place. The last two years of that were challenging, as the service I worked in was privatised.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/9">On my first day working for Virgin Care, I was advised that my political beliefs did not fit in with the company objectives. As my beliefs involved free healthcare at the point of need and always putting patients before profit, that affirmed my fears that the health service was moving away from its fundamental principles. I shall have more to say about Virgin Care in future debates. I will also continue to campaign tirelessly for a fully renationalised NHS and, on the subject of today's debate, I will fight for the future of Dewsbury hospital, which remains under threat of significant downgrade and whose accident and emergency service is fighting for its life.</p>
	<p pid="a.936.2/10">Dewsbury has many challenges ahead over the next five years, not least in relation to the growing inequality we now see in our country. I intend to use my time diligently as Dewsbury&#8217;s Member of Parliament to redress that, and to fight for the fairer, more equal society that my constituents deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.938.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25421" name="Paula Sherriff">the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff)</phrase> on her eloquent maiden speech. It is great to see another strong woman in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.0/2">I am mindful of the time constraints in the debate and, although I would love to talk about GP access and hospital finances, I shall concentrate on accident and emergency targets and, in particular, the target of 95% of patients being seen within four hours. I speak as a nurse who has worked in A&amp;E under the last Labour Government when the four-hour target was introduced. I hope that my clinical experience will be used to inform the debate and take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.0/3">I want to make four key points on A&amp;E targets and the four-hour wait. First&#8212;like <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25318" name="Philippa Whitford">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24761" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase>&#8212;I am not a fan of targets. As a healthcare professional, I found them increasingly frustrating. They are great as a tool, but they are being used as a political stick with which to beat healthcare workers and the system. There was no</p>
	<p pid="a.938.0/4">clinical rationale for choosing the four-hour target. There is no evidence that the morbidity or mortality of someone who waits for four hours and 30 minutes is compromised. Similarly, there is no evidence that the healthcare received by someone who has waited for three hours and 30 minutes is any better than that received by someone who has waited for four hours. The four-hour target is actually not that helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.939.1/1">I will not take any interventions owing to the restriction on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.939.1/2">I shall give the House an example. When I worked as a nurse in A&amp;E&#8212;under the Labour Government&#8212;an elderly gentleman was brought in during a busy night shift. He had fallen at home and broken his hip, and he was put in a corridor to wait. After three hours and 30 minutes, he called me over, saying, &#8220;Nurse, I desperately need to go to the toilet.&#8221; I had nowhere to put him. The best thing I could do was to wheel a curtain around his trolley, and there, in the middle of a busy hospital corridor, that elderly gentleman with war medals on his chest went to the toilet. He was seen within four hours. That box was ticked and he was deemed to have had good healthcare, but I was not particularly impressed with that care. Let us not kid ourselves that meeting that target always means that the patient experience is good or that the outcome is any better.</p>
	<p pid="a.939.1/3">My second point, which relates to my worry that this debate is being used as a political football, is that the four-hour target is not being seen in the context of the bigger picture. Other targets show that, even with the increased numbers attending A&amp;E, more and more patients are getting their treatment within four hours. Similarly, the clinical outcomes&#8212;surely the most important factor&#8212;relating to diseases such as heart attacks show that morbidity and mortality rates have improved. There have also been better outcomes for people who have had strokes and for trauma victims. So outcomes for patients are improving despite the four-hour target not having been met during the past 100 weeks. We should welcome that and congratulate our NHS staff on achieving it.</p>
	<p pid="a.939.1/4">Thirdly, if this is a serious debate about A&amp;E services throughout the whole of the United Kingdom, which we are surely all here to represent, why are we not looking at the rate in Scotland of only 87%, in Labour-run Wales of 83% and in Northern Ireland of 79%? This debate is a political one, and as a healthcare worker, I find that distressing. It is interesting that those Members who have worked in the NHS believe that the four-hour target is a useful tool but that it should not be used as a political stick.</p>

	<p pid="a.939.5/1">It is an NHS figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.939.5/2">I shall attempt to move the debate forward with my fourth point. If we are serious about tackling the issues resulting from the number of patients using A&amp;E services, we need to acknowledge that 15% of patients who go to</p>
	<p pid="a.939.5/3">A&amp;E could receive treatment elsewhere, in local community facilities. We need to look seriously at the Government&#8217;s proposals for seven-day-a-week health service, and if Opposition Members are serious about working with healthcare professionals to improve the experience of patients, they should surely welcome the introduction of out-of-hours services to take the pressure off A&amp;E.</p>
	<p pid="a.939.5/4">The thing I find most distressing about the motion is that it is full of criticism and complaints but offers no solutions. My plea to Opposition Members is that we should work together for the benefit of patients. We cannot continue to have patients whose care is being compromised even though they have ticked the four-hour box. We have only to look at the example of Mid Staffs, where the four-hour target was met time and again while terrible incidents were happening behind the scenes. Let us stop using the NHS as a political football; let us start working together. I would welcome the efforts of all Members to work together with the Government to deliver out-of-hours services and take the pressure off A&amp;E units and the staff who work in them.</p>

She is part of a very talented 2015 intake&#8212;far too talented for my liking, I am afraid to say.

That closure has been felt very deeply by my constituents, who now have to travel to North Tees, which is some 13 miles away, for accident and emergency services. Given the appalling provision of public transport, the low level of car ownership and the relative levels of deprivation, that is too far to travel for far too many of my constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.940.1/1">Will my hon. Friend comment on the impact of that A&amp;E closure on, and its implications for, areas below the River Tees, including my constituency? In South Tees, despite the best efforts of our NHS staff, waiting times have increased and the A&amp;E target in particular continues to be missed.</p>

	<p pid="a.940.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. Having fewer A&amp;E departments puts further strain on other parts of the system, such as A&amp;E at James Cook hospital, and other parts of the NHS, such as ambulance services. They are queuing up outside James Cook hospital, but it does not have the throughput it needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.2/2">It is important that A&amp;E returns to the town of Hartlepool. Given the level of health inequality, as well as the high proportion of older people relative to the rest of the country, there is a greater risk of accidents and, therefore, I think it is fair to say, greater reliance on A&amp;E than other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.2/3">To be frank&#8212;this is not a party political point&#8212;the closure was based on clinical safety factors. The number of medical staff to cover two rotas at both Hartlepool and Stockton was deemed insufficient, and the supervision of junior medical staff was deemed inadequate, as it did not meet modern guidance criteria. Additional resources will need to be provided for adequate staffing to ensure that A&amp;E can return to Hartlepool. North Tees and Hartlepool Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has a financial deficit of &#163;4 million, which is expected to worsen over the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="a.941.0/1">In the coming winter months the Royal Free hospital in my constituency will once again face pressure in A&amp;E and other services. Does my hon. Friend agree that the extra winter NHS funding should be allocated sooner rather than later so that hospitals can start planning, and that it should be included in the forthcoming Budget?</p>

	<p pid="a.941.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a really important point. On the additional resources, the north-east region has not been provided with anything, despite the level of health inequalities and the additional pressure on resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.941.1/2">Lynne Hodgson, the director of finance at the trust, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.941.1/3">&#8220;The whole system is stretched financially.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.941.1/4">The situation is so bad that the trust has recently taken out a &#163;2 million loan. That is not for investment in health services&#8212;it is not helping to pump prime the return of A&amp;E to Hartlepool&#8212;but for paying the wage bills of current staff. When an organisation has to borrow to meet obligations for something as fundamental as its staff&#8217;s monthly pay packets, something is fundamentally wrong with the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.941.1/5">I am arguing for the services to be returned to the town, but given the precarious finances of the trust I am fearful that most services will move further away or simply cease to operate, putting further pressures on the local health economy, such as James Cook hospital, and other parts of health and social care. What will the Government do to ensure that the finances of the North Tees and Hartlepool trust are put on a more secure footing while at the same time allowing such essential services to return to the town?</p>
	<p pid="a.941.1/6">I fully accept that clinical safety for A&amp;E services is paramount&#8212;I will never argue against that&#8212;but I have to question the model of acute accident and emergency services in my area. Over the past two decades or so, there has been a tendency to centralise services at North Tees, to the detriment of patients from Hartlepool and those slightly further away in south-east Durham. The momentum programme was going to centralise services on to a single site, culminating in a new hospital at Wynyard that would serve the populations of Hartlepool, Stockton, Easington and Sedgefield. The Government have made it perfectly obvious through their actions that Wynyard will not go ahead, which, together with NHS England&#8217;s &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221;, shows that smaller hospitals can thrive. Indeed, we have seen that across the region and the country. Darlington, whose population is only slightly larger than mine and which comes under the County Durham and Darlington NHS</p>
	<p pid="a.941.1/7">Foundation Trust, is able to maintain an A&amp;E. Hexham has a population not of 92,000 like Hartlepool, but of 13,000, and it is able to maintain an A&amp;E at Hexham general hospital. Clearly, centralisation is not the answer everywhere. Different clinical models and reconfigurations are available to allow smaller towns to retain their A&amp;Es.</p>

	<p pid="a.942.1/1">That is an incredibly important point. I started with staffing and I will end on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.1/2">I want to make a vital point. The Minister spoke of local solutions, and the people of Hartlepool, Hartlepool Borough Council and I, as the MP for Hartlepool, want that to be the approach, but we are not being heard. I understand that there are always tensions between the wishes of the public with regard to where health services are located and the essential requirements of clinical safety, but, as shown by the examples I have given, there are other ways. The local trust is simply not listening. Given that I, the people of Hartlepool and the local authority&#8212;regardless of its political complexion&#8212;want this, what will the Government do to ensure that, in the shaping of local accident and emergency services, the voices of local people and their democratically elected representatives are genuinely heard?</p>
	<p pid="a.942.1/3">As I said, I started by addressing staffing and I want to finish on that, too. I hope I have made it clear that I want A&amp;E to return to Hartlepool, but it is clear that the pressure on acute services would be reduced if there was more access to primary care. The GP per head of population ratio is low in Hartlepool, with 63 GPs per 100,000. That is significantly lower than the north-east regional average&#8212;only Stockton has a lower ratio&#8212;and it is lower than the average in England. Greater access to GPs and better integration of all health and social care services has to be the way forward, but that also includes giving the people of Hartlepool what they want, which, put simply, is a fully functioning hospital in the town and an accident and emergency department at its very heart.</p>

	<p pid="a.942.2/1">Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. May I join other hon. Members in welcoming you to the Chair? This is the first time I have spoken with you in your place, and it is very good to see you there. May I also extend my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25421" name="Paula Sherriff">the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff)</phrase> on her maiden speech? Like other hon. Members, I thank sincerely the people who work in our NHS and perform such an important task on behalf of the nation&#8217;s health.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/2">When the shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11511" name="Jamie Reed">the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr Reed)</phrase>, introduced the debate, I intervened and mentioned the fact that, in 2005, under a Labour Government&#8212;the decision was made in the then Labour Department of Health&#8212;Crawley hospital lost its accident and emergency unit. In the six decades of Crawley new town&#8217;s history, that will prove to be the worst possible mistake. The people of Crawley, which is the natural</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/3">population centre of the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust area, had to travel up to 10 miles up the road, on single carriageway highways, to access East Surrey hospital. The result has been at best inconvenience and at worst dangerous situations for many patients trying to reach the hospital. The South East Coast Ambulance Service does sterling work, but it has been a great challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/4">I am pleased that, in the past five years, hospital services have returned to Crawley hospital. We have an urgent treatment centre that is open seven days a week, 24 hours a day. We are about to have new GP primary access at the Crawley hospital site in West Green, and I was delighted a few years ago to open the new digital mammography unit. We have increased beds and staff at Crawley hospital, and I was pleased to open a new MRI scanner earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/5">None of that would have been possible without the previous Government&#8217;s commitment to increase funding on the NHS. Through the Health and Social Care Act 2012, they ensured that many more decisions are made locally by the Crawley clinical commissioning group, which means that local doctors and clinicians have far greater influence to meet the needs of my population and my constituents in Crawley. It was a very welcome development.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/6">I support the Government&#8217;s commitment to invest further in the NHS and to increase its funding, and their commitment to ensure that GP services are extended, not only for patients&#8217; convenience, but to ensure that, as far as possible, we divert those unnecessary attendances at the urgent treatment centre at Crawley hospital and A&amp;E at East Surrey hospital. That initiative will have a significant impact on reducing the pressure on A&amp;E.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/7">In addition, I support and welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to ensure that social care plays an important part, so that people who should not be detained in hospital any longer, not only for their own health needs but for the health of the healthcare system, are moved into appropriate care settings. That will mean more capacity for A&amp;E.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/8">Finally, on the future of healthcare in the Crawley area, my constituency contains Gatwick airport. Next week, we will hear the results of the Airports Commission into runway expansion. If Gatwick is the commission&#8217;s choice, an awful lot of infrastructure investment will need to be placed into the area, not only for transport such as rail and roads but for healthcare. Should Gatwick airport be the Government&#8217;s final decision&#8212;for the reasons of infrastructure pressure, I do not believe Gatwick is the appropriate location&#8212;an absolute necessity would be a new acute hospital with full A&amp;E.</p>
	<p pid="a.942.2/9">I welcome what the Government have done to support our national health service and their commitment in this Parliament, and I look forward to playing my part in ensuring that the needs of our patients and the needs of our NHS remain a central priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.943.0/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make my maiden speech during this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/2">Earlier this year, our A&amp;E department at Salford Royal hospital&#8212;a flagship of NHS excellence&#8212;endured a period of crisis that was a symptom not just of the</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/3">national shortfall in funding but of the far wider challenges we face in my constituency of Salford and Eccles. None the less, Salford, Eccles, Swinton and Pendlebury collectively make an amazing place to live, in terms of both the spirit of their people and their ambition to achieve the unthinkable.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/4">We have a rich political history. I am a proud socialist, and if any city personifies the struggles of the working class and the Labour movement, it is Salford. Salford was pivotal in the creation of the trade union movement, with Salford and Manchester trades councils founding the TUC in 1868. On <phrase class="date" code="1931-10-01">1 October 1931</phrase>, thousands swarmed to Salford town hall, where a violent demonstration took place. It came to be known as the battle of Bexley Square. They were protesting at the 10% cut in unemployment benefit introduced by the new national Government. Sadly, we face similar struggles in Salford and Eccles today.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/5">Freidrich Engels&#8217;s pioneering work, &#8220;The Condition of the Working Class&#8221; was inspired by the struggles he witnessed in Salford, where he owned a factory and could often be found drinking in The Crescent pub with Karl Marx. Members will be delighted to know that Engels&#8217;s magnificent beard has inspired a climbing wall sculpture in Salford. The 16-foot beard statue&#8212;a &#8220;symbol of wisdom and learning&#8221;&#8212;will stand on the University of Salford&#8217;s campus. Members will be able to scale the impressive beard to a viewing platform at the top, where they might find time to rest and contemplate.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/6">We are a city facing the legacy of post-industrial decline. Members may recall the song &#8220;Dirty Old Town&#8221;, penned by Ewan MacColl and later sung by, among others, The Pogues, about finding love in 20th century industrial Salford by the gasworks wall. The gasworks wall still exists today, but Salford&#8217;s gas industry has largely disappeared, along with our mining community, destroyed in the 1980s, as was our large shipping, engineering and manufacturing base. Thousands of lives, hopes and dreams were shattered, with generations locked in a cycle of low-paid unskilled work. We were told that free market globalisation of industry would eventually see wealth trickle down from the top. We are still waiting.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/7">We were a city on its knees and we can be thankful for the foresight of Salford&#8217;s Labour councillors who encouraged investment and growth. They championed the transformation of the derelict docks into Salford Quays, now a residential and cultural quarter housing the Lowry gallery, theatre and shopping centre. Again, it was the Salford Labour Council and our local MPs who ensured the building of Media City, the new headquarters for the BBC and ITV, against resistance from a southern-based media that saw anything north of the Watford gap as a social and cultural backwater.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/8">I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Hazel Blears. Elected alongside a record number of women MPs in 1997, Hazel is admired by many, including me, for breaking the glass ceiling not just for women in Salford but for all women from working class back grounds like myself. Indeed, much of Hazel&#8217;s time in the House was dedicated to promoting schemes that would give young people from disadvantaged areas the chance to forge a career in politics and other vocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/9">I would also like to honour Ian Stewart, who served as MP from 1997 to 2010, for the now abolished constituency of Eccles. Ian was a proud trade unionist,</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/10">like myself, who never forgot the poverty and struggles of his childhood. Recently, in his current role as Mayor of Salford, Ian urged the Government to rethink the savage cuts to the Salford City Council budget, austerity measures that are neither justified nor necessary. These cuts are now sawing through the bones of our already fragile public services and they severely impact on the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/11">It might startle hon. Members to hear that life expectancy in the more deprived parts of my constituency is lower than the life expectancy of people living in the Gaza strip. Some 30% of children in parts of my constituency live in poverty. Our unemployment rates are above the national average and our wages for those in work far below it. Many families are trapped in a cycle of poverty and low-paid and insecure work. The gap between rich and poor is now growing at a faster rate than in the Victorian era. Evidence from the world over indicates that health outcomes are linked not just to material poverty but economic inequality. It reduces social cohesion, leading to more stress, fear, and insecurity, which places even greater strain on our NHS and public services. Our NHS will only truly succeed when we invest in people and their quality of life. That means adequate funding for our public services, decent and affordable housing, well-paid secure jobs and a clear and apparent reduction in income inequality between those at the top and those at the bottom.</p>
	<p pid="a.943.0/12">My constituency and its people have a proud socialist history. I intend to use my time in the House to fight for them to have a proud socialist future as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.945.0/1">Before I move on to the comments I intend to make, may I pay tribute to an excellent maiden speech by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25368" name="Rebecca Long-Bailey">the hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Rebecca Long Bailey)</phrase>? Her pride in her home town is obvious. It shone through in a very punchy and effective maiden speech, and I thank her for giving it.</p>
	<p pid="a.945.0/2">My mother spent most of her professional life as a midwife in Lewisham hospital, the hospital of my birth. I used to go to her office and do my homework there after I left school, so I was literally born and brought up in Lewisham hospital. Both my sons were born in Lewisham hospital&#8212;a hospital I love and am proud of. I do not doubt for a second the passion of Opposition Members for the NHS. I remind them, however, that they do not have a monopoly on passion and respect for the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.945.0/3">We are talking today about waiting times in A&amp;E. There are many complicated and compounding pressures that drive those waiting times. This debate could and should have been an opportunity to discuss them and look for solutions and mitigations. I was taken by the calm and professional speech of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25318" name="Philippa Whitford">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)</phrase>. While she was speaking, it was impossible to be in the Chamber and not to be heavily influenced by the remarks she made. We would all be in a significantly better place if, during the rest of this speech and the rest of our time in this Parliament, NHS debates could be conducted in the manner in which the hon. Lady delivered her speech.</p>

	<p pid="a.946.1/1">I will not take interventions, because I am conscious of how many others wish to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.1/2">A&amp;E waiting times are driven by three factors: the number of people coming in; the time it takes to treat them; and the ability to discharge or transfer patients. I do not have time to discuss the process that happens while patients are in an A&amp;E department, so I will let others with more direct operational experience do that. It is ridiculous for any of us to pretend that the changes to the GP contract of 2004 did not have a significant and detrimental effect on waiting times for A&amp;E. The fact that 90% of GPs chose to opt out of out-of-hours provision must have had an effect on the number of people going to A&amp;E departments.</p>

	<p pid="a.946.3/1">I am not taking interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.3/2">The fact that the ability to discharge patients back into the community is dependent on the ability to care for them while they are in the community means that adult social care must be considered an essential and integral part of the A&amp;E mix. If general wards are not able to discharge into the community, they are not able to make bed spaces available and, in turn, A&amp;E departments are not able to transfer to other wards within the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.3/3">I therefore pay tribute to the excellent work done on the Manchester model, putting together NHS provision and adult social care, so that the obvious inter-relationship between the two could be looked at holistically. I am happy that some Opposition Members&#8212;perhaps only some of them&#8212;welcomed the introduction of the Manchester model. Again, if we could work in a cross-party, collegiate way to learn the lessons from that integrated service model in Manchester and roll it out nationally, I think we would be in a much better place for looking at and subsequently dealing with the problem of A&amp;E waiting times.</p>
	<p pid="a.946.3/4">It has been alleged&#8212;I am sure Opposition Members will all leap to their feet to deny it&#8212;that Labour Members were keen during the last general election to weaponise the NHS. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Those were not my words. This is too important an issue to turn into a party political football. I will make this commitment&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.947.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="947"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0003.htm#150624-0003.htm_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.947.0/1">I hope, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you and the House will indulge me if I spend my six minutes giving an update on the &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221; programme, which afflicts west and north-west London. I have done so several times during the three years since&#8212;to the consternation and disbelief of 2 million people in those areas&#8212;the programme was announced, although there was something of a hiatus over the election period.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/2">I do not want to be self-indulgent, but I think that the subject of &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221; is one to which all Members will wish to pay attention, because it is the biggest closure programme in the history of the NHS. Four out of nine A&amp;E departments and two major hospitals have been substantially downgraded. Many see the programme as a prototype for the Keogh review of urgent and emergency care. I wonder what has happened to the latest stage of that review; we heard nothing about it from the Under-Secretary of State. It was put on ice last year because a proposal for the downgrading of most of the type 1 A&amp;E departments in the country was seen as political suicide, but it now seems to have disappeared completely. I hope that there are good clinical reasons for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/3">Reference has already been made to the excellent briefing with which Members were provided yesterday by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. Here are three of the statistics that the college came up with. The increase in A&amp;E attendances last year was equivalent to the workload of seven large A&amp;E departments; only 2% of A&amp;E attendances involve major trauma, stroke and heart attack patients; and a maximum of 15% of patients who attend A&amp;E departments could be seen in a non-hospital setting. Even that must be subject to a caveat, because I suspect that a fair number of the people who go to A&amp;E departments are not knowingly accelerating their symptoms or time-wasting, but have genuine concerns, perhaps for a child with a fever that might be a symptom of flu but, again, might be due to meningitis.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/4">The solution proposed by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine is co-location. Its briefing states:</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/5">&#8220;Costly and time-consuming efforts to encourage patients to seek advice on urgent care by telephone or to attend elsewhere&#8230;have not reduced A&amp;E attendances. Rather than blaming patients for attending A&amp;E, when we know they have great difficulty accessing supposed alternatives, RCEM advocates a completely new approach. We believe that the issue should be dealt with by collocating&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/6">However, many hospitals in west London are already co-located, so that cannot be a solution for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/7">There have been a number of developments in the past three or four months. Chelsea and Westminster hospital is about to take over West Middlesex University hospital. That new trust will believe that it can maintain two fully functioning type 1 A&amp;E departments&#8212;unless another is to close in the area. Why, then, is Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust expected to manage with only one major A&amp;E service in its three hospitals?</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/8">Ealing hospital&#8217;s maternity unit will close on <phrase class="date" code="2015-07-01">1 July</phrase>. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13934" name="Virendra Sharma">the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma)</phrase>, who could not stay for this part of the debate, asked me specifically to mention that, because it is a matter of great concern, not least because it will have an impact on other maternity services in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/9">We are still suffering the effects of the closure of the A&amp;E departments at Hammersmith and Central Middlesex hospitals last September, including four-hour waiting times at other hospitals such as Charing Cross hospital in my constituency, which is persistently below target. At the same time, stroke services are being centralised at Charing Cross for at least the next five years, having been transferred from St Mary&#8217;s hospital, although the plan is to move them away in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/10">In the last two years, &#163;33 million has been spent on consultants just for the purposes of the &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221; programme, of which &#163;12.5 million was spent on a single consultant, McKinsey. That is &#163;27,000 a day, and it could pay for 300 new nurses. Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust is spending one eighth of its staffing budget on bank and agency staff, and the most recent figures show that it had an &#163;18.5 million deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/11">Against this crisis&#8212;and it is a crisis&#8212;in A&amp;E, the proposal in relation to Charing Cross, a major emergency hospital in my constituency, is that all its buildings be demolished, that its beds be reduced from 360 to 24, and that it lose all consultant emergency services. The population of London, and of west London in particular, is going to go up massively over the next 10 years. That is unprecedented. This is a very poor scheme, not just clinically for the reasons that the Royal College of Emergency Medicine gives, but logistically, spatially and financially.</p>
	<p pid="a.947.0/12">I am grateful to the Minister and the Secretary of State for the opportunity, at last, before the summer recess to meet and discuss these matters in depth. I will therefore say no more about them today. I look forward to that opportunity, and I know the Minister will attend in good faith and look at the concerns we all have about the &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221; programme. These are not idle concerns. It is obviously in the Whips&#8217; brief for Government Members to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not make the NHS a political football,&#8221; but I do not think any Opposition Member is doing so. We are not in an election period.</p>

	<p pid="a.948.0/1">It is a bit rich for Government Members to accuse us of using the NHS as a party political football, when prior to the 2014 local elections the Ilford North Conservative Association put out a leaflet claiming that King George hospital&#8217;s A&amp;E would not close, when before the general election we were told its closure would be reprieved, and when the NHS trust chief executive has now told us that the closure plan will be published in the next six to nine months. That was playing party politics with the NHS, cynically.</p>

	<p pid="a.948.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. I make sure that every time I refer to what is happening in my local NHS now, I look into the voluminous papers on &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221;, or what the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust actually says, so that I am clear that I am describing what is happening, not giving my opinion or saying something that has come from a party political standpoint.

	<p pid="a.948.2/1">I apologise for coming late to my hon. Friend&#8217;s speech. The reason why is that outside Ealing hospital there are</p>

	<p pid="a.949.0/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. No one does more than him, directly and positively, to draw attention to the crisis in the NHS in west London. His local hospital, Hillingdon, is not closing, but throughout the process over the past three years he has been absolutely steadfast in defending and supporting those of us whose local NHS is being downgraded, not just because he is a good comrade, but because he knows that the knock-on effect of hospital closures will make it impossible for any of the 2 million people throughout north-west and west London to receive a decent health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.0/2">I shall say no more today, as other Members wish to speak. I again thank the Minister for the opportunity we will have to make our case. I hope the Government are listening on this matter, which is the most urgent matter that I have dealt with in my 30 years as a councillor and as an MP. It is about the preservation of the NHS for a substantial part of London&#8217;s population. These are genuine and legitimate concerns, and I hope the Government will listen to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.949.1/1">I, too, congratulate the two new Members, for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff) and for Salford and Eccles (Rebecca Long Bailey), who have spoken. I made my maiden speech a couple of weeks ago and know what a terrifying experience it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/2">As Members from all parts of the House may already know, I have watched the NHS provide first-class healthcare to my mother, who has had a debilitating long-term musculoskeletal condition for the past 20 years. I am absolutely certain that without the support of the NHS her pain and suffering would have been an awful lot worse. Having said that, I should note that on a number of occasions she has needed to visit A&amp;E to make her condition a little better, and, although improvements have been seen, her experiences have been mixed. I appreciate that my family&#8217;s case is just one example of this care. Improvements have been seen but people from around the UK are facing a mixed picture on care received at A&amp;Es.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/3">From the outset, I wish to stress, in agreement with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24761" name="Sarah Wollaston">the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25318" name="Philippa Whitford">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)</phrase>, that turning this issue into a political football is not helpful and that this is not a new issue. I have worked alongside the NHS for seven years and have given advice and support to four Health Secretaries, both Labour and Conservative, with each saying that they would do all they could to improve A&amp;Es across the UK and more than their predecessor to cut unnecessary bureaucracy for medical professionals. As I said, this issue is not a new one. Emergency medical professionals have been warning that a hiatus has been on the horizon for a decade or more. I am therefore pleased that this Secretary of State has recognised the need to look at the issue much more seriously and holistically.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/4">I would like to spend some time correcting a number of myths that have been espoused by the Opposition. First, and most importantly, I should say that the increase in A&amp;E attendance is not because funding has been cut. The better care programme, designed to integrate health and social care services between national Government and local authorities, is predicted to reduce A&amp;E admissions by 3%. The 111 service launched in 2013 directs 8% of callers to A&amp;E departments, whereas 30% of these people would have gone to A&amp;E if the service were not available. In addition, &#163;150 million has been provided to fund evening and weekend GP appointments, through the Prime Minister&#8217;s challenge fund, meaning that people can access care through GPs instead of having to go to A&amp;E.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/5">Given that picture, we are clearly not going to be able to provide the high-quality care that is needed without proper investment. I am pleased that this Government have decided to take on board the recommendations of Simon Stevens and invest a further &#163;8 billion in the NHS. That, of course, will have a significant positive effect on A&amp;Es. Last year, the Government invested a record total of &#163;700 million, ensuring local services had the certainty of additional money and time to plan how best to use it. As the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said:</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/6">&#8220;This represents the largest annual additional funding yet seen.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/7">I know from speaking to people at the Royal United hospital in my constituency that this additional investment has really helped.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/8">The Opposition spend most of their time trying to do down our achievements, which the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24922" name="Ben Gummer">the Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase>, espoused in his opening remarks, but the protection of the NHS budget and the additional funding since 2010 has enabled A&amp;E departments&#8217; capacity to increase significantly since 2010. That additional funding has paid for 2,500 beds in both acute and community treatment, and the equivalent of 1,000 new doctors. We have now added almost 1,200 additional A&amp;E doctors, including an additional 400 A&amp;E consultants, and 1,700 additional paramedics since 2010. The additional &#163;2 billion being invested in front-line care in 2015-16 will go a long way to supporting the NHS into the next winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/9">My next point relates to weekly reporting of A&amp;E data. The Opposition will be very much aware that the best healthcare decisions are clinically led, although it seemed as though they disagreed with that earlier on. As Sir Bruce Keogh rightly explained in his recent letter to the chief executive of NHS England:</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/10">&#8220;There is concern that, in a small number of instances, some targets are provoking perverse behaviours and the complexity of others is obscuring their purpose and meaning.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/11">I agree with him that the A&amp;E standard has been an important means of ensuring that people who need to get rapid access to urgent and emergency care do so, and we must not lose that focus. I also agree that with him that we do not need to review the four-hour standard at this time and that we need to look at a wider range of measures if we are to drive improved outcomes across the entire system.</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/12">I totally agree with the suggestion that we standardise reporting arrangements so that performance statistics for A&amp;E, referral to treatment times, cancer, diagnostics,</p>
	<p pid="a.949.1/13">ambulances, 111 and delayed transfers of care are all published on one day each month. That fits very nicely with the calls from medical practitioners across the UK for a reduction in the burdens of bureaucracy that have been crippling productivity at the heart of our NHS. One key reason for my brother and his wife leaving this country to practise medicine in New Zealand was this overarching issue of bureaucracy. I very much hope this plan will show medical professionals and patients that we all look to improve the quality of data collection.</p>

	<p pid="a.951.1/1">Yes, absolutely, I did.

	<p pid="a.951.4/1">It is indeed a huge honour, Madam Deputy Speaker, to be called by you today to make my maiden speech in this very important debate on A&amp;E services in the NHS. As an introduction, I can report with a small measure of glee that the NHS in Dumfries and Galloway has treated 96.8% of all A&amp;E outpatients within the Scottish Government&#8217;s target of four hours. The NHS remains safe in public hands north of the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/2">As is customary, I wish to pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr Russell Brown, who was elected to this House in 1997 on a tidal wave of Blairite euphoria, ousting the seemingly immoveable Sir Hector Monro. My election to this House has absolutely nothing to do with Russell Brown as a person or as a constituency MP. He was merely a victim of the political reawakening that has occurred all over Scotland, and the resultant Scottish National party tsunami, and he was let down badly by his party. My message to Russell is simple: thank you, Russell, for your tireless dedication to the people of Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/3">The Labour party has left the people of Dumfries and Galloway and of Scotland; it is not the other way round. My message to those on the Labour Benches is simple: can they please get their act together? We had an opportunity to defeat this Tory Government</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/4">last week to create a referendum fairness board, and they blew it. They would rather sit on their hands or vote with the Tories than support an SNP proposal. They should ditch the tribal opposition and work with us so that we can put this wafer-thin majority to its full test.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/5">This SNP group is determined to dismantle the myths that surround our brand of nationalism. Perhaps I am in the best position to dispel those particular myths, because I am not from a traditional SNP nationalist household. Independence is not an argument that I used to subscribe to; I actually voted no to devolution in 1997, and I only joined the SNP four days after the independence referendum. My conversion has been protracted, evidence-based and not led by blind patriotism. As a dual qualified lawyer and businessman, I was invited to speak at a town hall debate, a mere 15 months ago, during the referendum, alongside my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25274" name="Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh">the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Ms Ahmed-Sheikh)</phrase>. I kept getting invited back&#8212;almost 50 times in fact. Here I am, 15 months later, in this world famous Chamber representing the people of my home region. What a privilege it is. A special mention goes to my wonderful wife, Anne, whose dedication to our two young children allows me to take up the privilege in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/6">Dumfries and Galloway, or the Scottish Riviera as I prefer to call it, is a constituency of serene beauty, abundant wildlife, vast forestry, rolling hills and a coastline that stretches almost 200 miles. It runs from my home town of Stranraer in the west to Wigtown, Newton Stewart and Whithorn in the Machars, to Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbright, Castle Douglas in the Stewartry, all the way across to Dalbeattie and Dumfries in the east. There is something for everyone. It is a place that I love dearly, and we are indeed a resilient bunch. It is, and should be even more, a tourist mecca. There are so many festivals and community initiatives&#8212;simply too many to mention in total. Members should visit the book town of Wigtown, the artists&#8217; town of Kirkcudbright, and the Wickerman festival. They should watch out for the UK&#8217;s finest oyster festival in Stranraer, coming soon. We are a region of entrepreneurs, innovators and inventors. We invented the pedal bicycle and discovered electro-magnetism, and we gave Christianity to Scotland in the fifth century through St Ninian of Whithorn.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/7">In my view, Dumfries and Galloway is dynamic and growing, with more small businesses employing fewer than 10 people per head of population than any other constituency in Scotland&#8212;a remarkable statistic, given the rural economic disadvantages that we suffer. Small businesses are our largest employers, the lifeblood of our community and the lifeblood of our economy, but they need serious help to fulfil their potential. Throughout my constituency, 3G networks are very rare and 4G virtually non-existent; fibre-optic cables do not reach the outlying areas. That is simply not good enough. Would it not be fantastic if 5G was rolled out with 100% geographical coverage in the rural areas of the UK that need the help the most&#8212;places like Dumfries and Galloway? That is the real way we can rebalance our economy and it is something I pledge to fight extremely hard for in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/8">No maiden speech by an MP for Dumfries and Galloway would be complete without reference to our national treasure, Robert Burns. Although he was born</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/9">in Ayrshire, we in Dumfries and Galloway claim Scotland&#8217;s national bard as our very own. Burns wrote of the River Nith, which runs through the heart of Dumfries,</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/10">&#8220;The banks of the Nith are as sweet poetic ground as any I ever saw&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/11">It is hard to disagree. Dumfries was inspirational to Burns, who was at his most productive when living there, composing classics such as &#8220;Auld Lang Syne&#8221; and the masterpiece &#8220;Tam o&#8217; Shanter&#8221;. However, poverty and hunger were ever present in Robert Burns&#8217; life. We have food banks in Dumfries and Galloway, frequented not only by the poor and the disadvantaged, but by victims of draconian benefits sanctions and, more important, the working poor&#8212;people who work full-time but still find themselves living in poverty. In 2015 in my constituency, children are going to school hungry. Austerity policies are literally starving our children not just of a happy childhood, but of a successful future. Burns&#8217; gratitude for good nourishment was clear when he wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/12">&#8220;Some hae meat and canna eat,</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/13">And some wad eat that want it,</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/14">But we hae meat and we can eat,</p>
	<p pid="a.951.4/15">Sae let the Lord be thankit.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.953.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25351" name="Richard Arkless">the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Richard Arkless)</phrase> on his passionate maiden speech. I know how nerve-wracking it can be to speak here.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.1/2">I have experienced the good and the bad of the NHS. I have lost a loved one, but also seen the excellent care that my mum received when she had a knee replacement recently, and that my sister has received for her multiple sclerosis. For my university research dissertation, I looked at healthcare systems around the world, their per capita spend and outcomes. I can honestly say that my research showed that no country and no Government get it right 100% of the time, but I for one am proud of our NHS and I urge Labour Members to stop talking it down and to drop their selective amnesia. Every Member of this House has something to learn from our party history and I would like us all to pull together for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.1/3">We all have lessons to learn, so let us look at the UK statistics on A&amp;E services. NHS England has a 95% A&amp;E target and achieves 93%; the figure for Labour-controlled Wales is 83%, and for SNP-controlled Scotland, 87%. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Those are the figures from NHS Scotland, so perhaps hon. Members should check that out.</p>

	<p pid="a.953.3/1">No, as I have only three minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.3/2">My point is that every Member of this House has lessons to learn. I think we should be critical friends, looking honestly at what works and what does not, and sharing best practice. If we look at our record, we see that NHS England has the best emergency care of any western nation. We should celebrate that fact. In Yorkshire and Humber alone, we have 582 more doctors and nurses than in 2010, and I celebrate that. I have worked</p>
	<p pid="a.953.3/3">for healthcare charities for the last four years. Today I met a patients&#8217; association and, together, we are setting up an all-party parliamentary group on patient care. We need to do things in a constructive manner, rather than using this issue for political means. It is only through collective working, including working with patients&#8217; groups and healthcare charities, and by looking at strong local leadership on a ward-by-ward basis, that change can happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.3/4">I welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to have a seven-day NHS. We will need to look at how that is managed, but it will take pressure off our A&amp;E services. I will finish by saying that we need to be a critical friend. We need to be honest and make sure there are consequences when things go wrong, and that lessons are learned. We also need to celebrate our fantastic NHS, in which we are still investing. I urge every Member in the House to support that.</p>

	<p pid="a.954.0/1">First, I place on record my condolences to the friends and family of the two people who tragically lost their life at Ealing Broadway station yesterday. I am sure that all Members of the House will join me in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/2">Who was it who said,</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/3">&#8220;I think of the emergency nurse practitioner in Surrey, still in his overalls, telling me that closing A&amp;E means an hour long drive to hospital for some people, and potentially lives lost&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/4">Does anyone know? It was <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10777" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr Cameron)</phrase> in 2007. In my constituency, that possibility is becoming a reality. Four of our A&amp;E units have either been closed or are closing. Charing Cross hospital has numerous specialisms, but 55% of the site has been earmarked for luxury housing&#8212;you couldn&#8217;t make it up. Both Hammersmith and Central Middlesex hospitals&#8217; A&amp;Es have already shut their doors, although Central Middlesex&#8217;s was a brand-new, well-rated facility. People are being diverted to Northwick Park, over 7 miles away from those two, which the Government&#8217;s own Care Quality Commission has rated as a failing hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/5">The Government claim that these units have been saved, but their replacement&#8212;urgent care centres&#8212;cannot be used for emergencies, are staffed by general practitioners rather than consultants, and do not take ambulances. In short, they are not A&amp;Es. Ealing hospital&#8212;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10383" name="John Martin McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> has gone now&#8212;loses its maternity services this month. The last projected birth is today, <phrase class="date" code="2015-06-24">24 June</phrase>. People see that as a precursor of things to come, given what is happening to A&amp;E.</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/6">Ealing hospital is where I lost my dad in September, so it is a place I know well. I remember the building going up in 1979. My dad was nearly 80 and had been ill for a long time, but we hear of cases such as that of the two-year-old in north London who was taken to what people thought was an A&amp;E, but it had closed down, and he died. These cases are dismissed as anomalies, but they will become more and more frequent, if not the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/7">In my constituency, Mrs Khorsandi lives in the next road to Central Middlesex hospital. In November, after its closure, she had a seizure and was taken to Northwick Park. Her daughter Shappi Khorsandi told me that the</p>
	<p pid="a.954.0/8">hospital discharged her, even though she was not well enough. It was clear that there was no room for her. Her daughter said, &#8220;As I don&#8217;t drive, she came home in a taxi. She has no recollection of that.&#8221; The mother had another fit at her daughter&#8217;s house, hit her head on the sink, was taken to hospital again, and had a third seizure in front of the doctors. The daughter told me that they were amazing. Out of nowhere, five people appeared, and they were excellent; however, they had no time to breathe, let alone answer questions. NHS staff are doing the best they can, but they are operating in incredibly uphill circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.955.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that while her urban constituency contrasts dramatically with my rural constituency, Government Front-Benchers should recognise the challenging geographical differences between our constituencies? The reason why the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust may run a &#163;26.3 million deficit is our challenging rural area.</p>

	<p pid="a.955.1/1">Yes. My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Another constituent of mine, Mr Anand, lives near Hammersmith hospital and its now closed A&amp;E. He wrote to me describing what he called &#8220;near third-world conditions&#8221;, and a queue of 10 ambulances. NHS North West London has had the worst waiting times in the country. We have witnessed cutting corners in a process that adds up to its fragmentation and selling off.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.1/2">The Tory promise, &#8220;No top-down reorganisation of the NHS&#8221;, did not come to pass for my constituents. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the Member for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter)</phrase> described, NHS North West London has spent &#163;33 million in two years on consultants. It spent &#163;13.2 million this year alone, including on Saatchi and Saatchi and McKinsey, through its programme &#8220;Shaping a healthier future&#8221;, which the locals see as trying to justify the closure of hospitals. Do not get me started on the famously airbrushed poster from 2010 that proclaimed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll cut the deficit, not the NHS&#8221;. In west London, that does not ring true. Ealing used to be known for comedy, but what has happened to our NHS locally has gone beyond a joke.</p>

	<p pid="a.955.2/1">We have had a good debate. I pay tribute to hon. Members who made their maiden speeches. I particularly congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff) and for Salford and Eccles (Rebecca Long Bailey). Having been a student at the University of Salford, I had not realised until now that I followed in the footsteps of Marx and Engels by supping in The Crescent; you learn something new every day. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25351" name="Richard Arkless">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Richard Arkless)</phrase> also made his maiden speech. I congratulate them on their contributions. It is clear that all three will make their presence felt in the House of Commons in the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/2">I thank the other Members who have contributed, particularly my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart), for Hartlepool (Mr Wright), for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter) and for Ealing Central and Acton (Dr Huq), and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25318" name="Philippa Whitford">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)</phrase>, who leads on health issues for the SNP. On the Government Benches, we</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/3">heard from the hon. Members for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Gordon Henderson), for Lewes (Maria Caulfield), for Crawley (Henry Smith), for Braintree (James Cleverly), for Bath (Ben Howlett), and for Morley and Outwood (Andrea Jenkyns). Many Conservative Members stuck very closely to their party&#8217;s policy research unit paper, a copy of which I was conveniently sent earlier today. I congratulate them on being so loyal to their Whips Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/4">It would be very remiss of me not to place on record my own tribute to the doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants and other dedicated NHS staff who provide such extraordinary and professional care. Many Members of this House who have been here for a number of years will know that I had a run of bad health about five years ago. As a result, I became far more familiar with my own local hospitals, Tameside general and Stepping Hill, than I had hoped to, even given my position as a constituency Member of Parliament and a shadow Health Minister. I have experienced the very best of NHS care. If I am honest, I also experienced some care that did not meet the standards that we perhaps expect of our NHS. I know, however, that we have a workforce who are completely dedicated and caring.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.2/5">The House should be in absolutely no doubt, though, that those staff are under a great deal of pressure&#8212;sustained pressure that has been building over the past five years. The facts need to be laid out in the open, and Ministers need to be challenged on their fictions. They made all sorts of desperate promises to get them through an election campaign, and now they need to show where the money is going to come from to pay for those promises and to set out exactly how they are going to deliver them. Yet what have Ministers been doing since the general election? I do not disagree with Professor Sir Bruce Keogh&#8217;s decision to improve the publication of data for mental health and for cancer&#8212;that is welcome&#8212;but I do disagree with what this Government intend to do in relation to A&amp;E data. Instead of dealing with the pressure facing the NHS in England, they have decided to stop publishing weekly data about those pressures.</p>

	<p pid="a.956.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the NHS leads the world in transparency, and that an excessive focus on one data point&#8212;the four-hour target for A&amp;E&#8212;is detrimental overall to patients?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.956.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11531" speakername="Andrew Gwynne" colnum="956"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0003.htm#150624-0003.htm_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.956.1/1">We should remember, of course, that the last Labour Government started that transparency with heart and stroke data.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/2">I think we all know what is going on here. There can be no clearer sign of the Tories&#8217; failure on the NHS than the fact that hospital accident and emergency departments have now missed their own four-hour target for 100 weeks in a row. This is a landmark failure, to which the Prime Minister promised he would not return. The reality is that this Government caused the crisis by making it harder to see a GP and by stripping back social care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/3">Let us be under no illusions&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The Secretary of State can chunter, but social care cuts are NHS cuts. The Government made damaging mistakes that have seen the number of people going into hospital soar. The best thing that they could do is to admit it and explain what they are going to do to fix the problem. It is stunning that their only solution is to spin their mistakes and to make the NHS less transparent.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/4">Let me briefly come on to nurse staffing problems. Only this week, we have seen yet another example of poor policy coming out of the Department of Health. If it insists, along with the Home Office, that migrants not earning &#163;35,000 after six years must go home, that will cut a hole right through the middle of our NHS. The Royal College of Nursing estimates that 6,620 nurses will have to leave the country by 2020. Because of the Government&#8217;s failure to train adequate numbers of nurses in the UK, those nurses will have cost almost &#163;40 million to recruit from overseas. People coming from other countries to work in the NHS make a huge contribution and our health service would not be able to cope without them, but this is now a mess entirely of Ministers&#8217; own making.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/5">The short-sighted cuts to nurse training in the early years of the last Parliament left NHS hospitals with no option but to recruit from overseas or hire expensive agency nurses. That is also one of the main reasons why many hospital trusts are now in deficit. It was an absolutely profound error and I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that. As ever with this Government, patients and taxpayers will pay the price for the Prime Minister&#8217;s mismanagement of the health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/6">There have been further mistakes. On GP access, it stands to reason that if it is made harder to see a GP, people will be more likely to end up in hospital. As we have heard, the reasons for the crisis are many, but the lack of access to GP services appears to account for much of the problem. No amount of obfuscation and massaging of figures can hide the fact that this Government have made it harder to get a GP appointment. All Members will know of constituents who have had to phone their doctors only to be told that no appointments are available and that they should ring back the next day&#8212;which they do, only to experience the same problem again. That they end up in frustration in A&amp;E should not come as any shock.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.1/7">The Prime Minister has now repeated his 2010 promise to provide access to GPs seven days a week, but he cannot even provide access to them five days a week. When patients want up-to-date information on how their local hospital is performing, this Government plan to publish the data less frequently. I hope that the Government will now see sense, and I commend our motion to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.957.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24719" speakername="Jane Ellison" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="957"  time="016:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0003.htm#150624-0003.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.957.0/1">Time is rather short, but I want to start by acknowledging one or two things. First, it is nice to see at least one signatory to the Labour non-grandstanding pact present for the closing speeches, if not the opening ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/2">More importantly, there were three maiden speeches. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25421" name="Paula Sherriff">The hon. Member for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff)</phrase> mentioned James Brown, and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25368" name="Rebecca Long-Bailey">the hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Rebecca Long Bailey)</phrase> mentioned The Pogues, so a musical theme has run through the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25351" name="Richard Arkless">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Richard Arkless)</phrase> took us to the Scottish riviera, via a wonderful Burns quote. We all enjoyed their maiden speeches very much. We also heard some thoughtful speeches from people with experience in the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/3">I say to those who are new to the House that those of us who were here in the last Parliament have a sense of d&#233;j&#224; vu about this debate and, indeed, the motion. We want to move on from that. The public gave us a mandate in the election based on our record on the NHS, our commitment to safeguard its future, our honesty in accepting the challenges that lie ahead and the need to find long-term solutions. A number of right hon. and hon. Members alluded to those challenges and solutions. The public saw through the Opposition&#8217;s tired attack at the election and realised that we were the party that was not only acknowledging the long-term pressures, but committing the resources that the NHS said it needed to continue to be the best health service in the world. That remains the big challenge for the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/4">As was said by the Chair of the Health Committee, whom I congratulate on her re-election, the election is behind us and we need to look forward; we need to look at the areas where there is consensus and remember the impact that debates in this House have on the wonderful staff in our NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/5">Let me put on the record what is happening in our accident and emergency services. The NHS in England achieved 94.9% of people in A&amp;E being seen, treated and discharged in four hours. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25318" name="Philippa Whitford">The hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Dr Whitford)</phrase>, who spoke for the SNP, underlined just what an achievement it is to deliver on those targets. We all enjoyed her thoughtful and measured contribution very much.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/6">The change from weekly to monthly A&amp;E performance reporting is based on the clinical advice of Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, as other Members have said. Far from reducing transparency, the change will increase it because, from August, NHS England will publish the key NHS performance data together. That will include more frequent reporting of cancer waits&#8212;something that is widely welcomed by cancer charities. The change is not only clinically based, but is supported by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, the Nuffield Trust, the NHS Confederation and the Patients Association. The Opposition are way out of line with all those bodies in their criticisms of the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/7">There has been talk of deficits in NHS providers. Of course that is cause for concern, but we are taking action on those deficits. As I said, during the general election campaign we talked about what we could do to address such long-term challenges. In opening the debate, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24922" name="Ben Gummer">the Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer)</phrase> mentioned the specific measures that are being taken to address trusts&#8217; deficits and help them get back into a better situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/8">On GP access, the fact is that four out of five people are able to get an appointment when it is convenient. We are building on that by investing &#163;175 million in extending GP access. By March next year, the Prime Minister&#8217;s challenge fund will cover 18 million people, who will get extended hours and weekend appointments if they need them.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/9">We have heard from hon. Members that GPs and other health professionals are responding positively to the challenges that the circumstances have set them. I was interested to hear of the innovations that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24828" name="Gordon Henderson">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Gordon Henderson)</phrase> told us about in his area. We</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/10">heard about the focus on increased access to mammography in Crawley. There were many other great examples of how the service is innovating.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/11">To meet demand, we have 1,200 more GPs than in 2010. The Secretary of State spoke only last week about a new way forward for GPs and an increased focus on under-doctored areas. That came out in a number of contributions, including that of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11362" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/12">Providing the funding to support the NHS&#8217;s &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221; has only been possible because of our long-term economic plan. We remain committed to listening to and supporting the NHS as it works through the detail of the delivery of the &#8220;Five Year Forward View&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/13">We are building on our record of achievement. Compared with five years ago, our NHS performs over 1 million more operations; has 9,100 more doctors and 8,800 more nurses; and sees, treats and discharges 3,000 more people within the four-hour target. We intend to build on those achievements in this Parliament. It is a great track record. However, the NHS simply cannot go on treating more people at that rate, so as Simon Stevens has said, we need to go up several gears on prevention&#8212;a subject to which I hope we will return at another time.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/14">There is growing political consensus on the need to integrate health and social care, which hon. Members have spoken about, and this Government have started to do that. It is all right to talk about it, but with the better care fund the Government have started to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/15">A strong NHS needs a strong economy, and that remains the unanswered question for the Opposition, both in the election and every time they sponsor one of these debates. We are committed to supporting our NHS, not running it down. We are backing the NHS&#8217;s own plan for meeting the challenges and opportunities of the future. That promise was not matched by the Opposition, and the public knew it. It remains the elephant in the room for their Front Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.957.0/16">As we go forward, that is where we on the Government side will be putting our collective energy: patients before party; prevention as well as cure; backing our NHS, not running it down. I urge the House to reject the motion.</p>

	Sport and the 2012 Olympics Legacy
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.964.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="964"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0003.htm#150624-0003.htm_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.964.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This House notes that the number of people participating in regular sport or physical activity has fallen significantly since the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games; fears that the Government has squandered the Olympic legacy it was bequeathed in 2010; believes that increasing participation in a wide range of sports is key to creating the next generation of elite athletes and to improving the health and wellbeing of the nation; and urges the Government to take urgent action to boost participation and support local grassroots sports clubs and associations.</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/3">Nobody seriously doubts that the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games were an enormous success. They were a beacon for the world; we showed how these things can be done and should be done, from the magnificent opening ceremony with its celebration of the industrial revolution and Labour&#8217;s part in creating the NHS through to the best-attended Paralympic games ever. Team GB won 29 gold, 17 silver and 19 bronze medals at the Olympics, and 120 medals at the Paralympic games. There were so many great moments: Mo Farah; Jessica Ennis; Charlotte Dujardin; Alistair Brownlee; Ellie Simmonds; Jade Jones; Nicola Adams; Chris Hoy, winning his seventh Olympic medal; Victoria Pendleton, winning her third; Rebecca Adlington and Katherine Grainger, winning their fourth medals; and David Weir and Sarah Storey, wining four golds each in just one games.</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/4">The very fact that the baton was passed from Labour to the coalition underlined basic British values: democracy, fair play&#8212;or, as we say in Wales, chwarae teg&#8212;and the rule of law. They were great times, but the point of hosting the games was never just to run a big event; there had to be a legacy. We were spending a lot of taxpayers&#8217; money and diverting &#163;675 million of lottery funds away from good causes, including the arts. The total cost of both games came to just under &#163;9 billion, so there had to be a legacy; otherwise, it was just the most expensive party in our history.</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/5">When we were in government and made the original bid, we said that we wanted to see</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/6">&#8220;millions more young people&#8212;in Britain and across the world&#8212;participating in sport and improving their lives&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/7">The coalition reaffirmed that in 2010, saying that it wanted to</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/8">&#8220;foster a healthy and active nation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/9">That is why Labour set a target of getting 2 million more people in England being active by 2012 and set up a &#163;140 million fund to provide free swimming to the over-60s and the under-16s.</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/10">In December 2010, the coalition set itself four legacy aims: increasing grassroots sporting participation; exploiting opportunities for economic growth; promoting community engagement; and ensuring the development of the Olympic Park after the games, to drive the regeneration of east London.</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/11">What has happened since then? Frankly, it has been an own goal, a dropped baton, a belly flop. The primary legacy aim was to increase participation, but, in virtually every region of this country and in virtually every sport, that has not happened&#8212;quite the reverse. It is striking. The figures are down in the north-east, the north-west, the east midlands, the west midlands, the south-east, the</p>
	<p pid="a.964.1/12">south-west and the eastern region. There are 62,100 fewer people participating every week in the north-west, and 72,200 fewer people participating every week in Yorkshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.965.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the decline actually started before the Olympic games? Is it not possible to pinpoint it to the scrapping of the schools sport partnership, which did such good work in spreading best practice and sports participation among young people in schools?</p>

	<p pid="a.965.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point and I hope the sports Minister was not booing in disagreement, because she made that point herself on <phrase class="date" code="2013-12-18">18 December 2013</phrase>. I look forward to her joining us in the Lobby later this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.965.1/2">This is not just about every region in the country; it is about every sport. Participation is down in non-Olympic sports, including cricket by 73,200 and squash by 79,900. Participation is also down in Olympic sports, including archery by 23,600, badminton by 119,800, basketball by 46,900, football by 121,400 and table tennis, or whiff-whaff, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999" name="Boris Johnson">the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase>&#8212;who bears some responsibility for all this&#8212;has often referred to it. Most striking of all, participation in the one sport that is participated in equally by men and women and boys and girls&#8212;it is the most popular sport in this country&#8212;is down by a massive 818,500. Thirty-three out of 45 funded sports have seen a fall or practically no increase at all in participation since the Olympic and Paralympic games.</p>

	<p pid="a.965.2/1">On the schools sport partnership, it is a fact that low sports participation is heavily correlated with depravation. One of the greatest problems in recent years is the decline in participation in areas of deprivation, which is exactly where the schools sport partnerships were doing such a superb job, including in my own constituency and in parts of London where space and external space are at a premium and where we have to work hard to overcome that.</p>

	<p pid="a.966.8/1">I warn Conservative Members who are enjoying a little moment of Borisonics that the truth of the matter is that the hon. Gentleman likes to elide his figures. It sounded as if he was comparing like with like, but of course he was not. He was comparing 2005 with now. It is true the Labour Government dramatically increased the participation in sport from 2005 to 2010, but his lot&#8212;his Government&#8212;managed to destroy that legacy. He can try to catch your eye later, Madam Deputy Speaker, and we will see whether he can recount better statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.966.8/2">All hon. Members can perhaps congratulate the new award-winning &#8220;This Girl Can&#8221; campaign. With such campaigns and with all the talk of improving female participation in sport, we might have thought that the figures for women would have improved, but unfortunately not: 212,000 fewer women take part in sport every week than at the time of the Olympics. That is why we needed that excellent campaign, run by Sport England, to try to fix the Government&#8217;s failures.</p>

	<p pid="a.966.9/1">The hon. Gentleman might be being a little selective in his use of statistics. When my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase> mentioned the 1.4 million extra people playing sport, he was rightly referring to the time at which the bid was secured.

	<p pid="a.967.0/1">I am sorry, but the former Secretary of State does not seem to understand that she is praising the Labour Government. We had significant success between 2005 and 2010, and I would argue that the success we achieved up to 2012 was significant, before she and her Government managed to get their hands on the situation. The problem is the legacy after the games, which happened entirely on the watch of the Conservatives. I noted earlier in Prime Minister&#8217;s questions that he kept referring to &#8220;the former Government&#8221;, but the former Government is his Government. The Conservatives can no longer run away from their own record on such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/2">Perhaps the most infuriating aspect of the statistics is what has happened to participation among those on lower incomes. In 2005-06, the year that the right hon. Lady and the hon. Gentleman referred to, when the bid was won, 27.2% of people on the lowest incomes participated in sport. When we left office, that had risen to 27.9%. In the post-Olympic year, 2012-13, which we are using as a baseline in these debates, participation had risen again to 29.3%, but in the most recent statistics, participation has fallen to 25.7%. Who can wonder why those on the lowest incomes are finding it difficult to participate in sport when it is expensive to take part in sport, local authorities are under the cosh financially, and many of the services they have relied on have simply disappeared?</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/3">Things are no better in Scotland. The Scottish Government do not keep accurate statistics on sport participation, perhaps for an obvious reason, but people living beside some of Glasgow&#8217;s most prominent Commonwealth games venues are now playing significantly less sport and taking less exercise than they did before the event last year. In particular, many people have complained that the games felt as though they were intended for posher and better-off parts of Glasgow and Scotland than for the people on the very doorsteps where the games were taking place.</p>

	<p pid="a.967.1/1">I had the privilege on Sunday of taking part in the Great Notts bike ride, where there were more cyclists than at any point in the event&#8217;s history. Surely, the hon.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase>, has increased dramatically?

	<p pid="a.967.2/1">Everybody would like to praise Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins and the many others who have led by example and the 46,000 additional people who have taken up cycling, but there are still significant problems that the Government and local authorities need to tackle and that is a small drop in the ocean compared with the overall figures, which have fallen significantly. In Labour-run Wales, by contrast, the figures are considerably better. Some 70% of adults participated in sport or physical recreation in the four weeks before the most recent survey, compared with just 44% in England.</p>

	<p pid="a.968.0/1">Oh dear, the Scottish National party always love to find somebody else to blame. The truth of the matter is that Scotland is run by the SNP, and that 80% of local authority budgets in Scotland are determined by the SNP in Holyrood. When the hon. Gentleman starts attacking Glasgow Council, he needs to start looking into his own backyard.</p>
	<p pid="a.968.0/2">The coalition Government said they would ensure the development of the Olympic Park after the games, but here there are further legacy worries. So far, the cost of transforming the venue into a stadium ready for football has reached &#163;272 million: &#163;15 million coming from West Ham, &#163;1 million from UK Athletics, &#163;40 million from Newham Council and &#163;25 million from the Government. The overall spend on the venue will now top &#163;700 million for the 54,000 seat arena&#8212;considerably more expensive per spectator than the &#163;798 million lavished on the 90,000 capacity Wembley stadium. The project is now over budget by about &#163;35 million, which comes close to the total cost of converting the City of Manchester stadium after the 2002 Commonwealth games. This has the feel, frankly, of a fiasco cooked up somewhere between the Mayor&#8217;s office, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Treasury, which is why, in the interests of transparency, I urge the Government to publish the full details of West Ham&#8217;s secret deal as a matter of urgency.</p>

	<p pid="a.969.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. He, too, is mystic, as that is a point I am coming on to.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/2">There has been this signal failure because, immediately on coming into office in 2010, the coalition abandoned the target on getting more people active. They scrapped the free swimming fund, putting local authorities under real pressure. They sold off school playing fields and they scrapped ring-fenced funding for sports school partnerships, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11531" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase> mentioned. They abandoned all targets for PE and sport in school. They have had four Secretaries of State in five years, and three sports Ministers all peddling their own preoccupations, rather than laying out a clear 10-year strategy for sports and activity. Their lazy, laissez-faire, hands-off attitude to sports has simply wasted our Olympic legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/3">Frankly, all that is very Conservative. We should remember that Mrs Thatcher did not close only the mines; she closed all the lidos in London as well. It is a fundamental principle of the Tories. How do I know that all this is the fault of the Government? Because the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport told us so herself. She said the other day:</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/4">&#8220;Government is in part to blame in that we have got a sport strategy that is very much out of date&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/5">Five years of your Government, seven years of the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip as Mayor&#8212;it is all your fault. They have had plenty of warnings, too, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24905" name="Bill Esterson">the Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> said. The Education Committee report of 2013 was absolutely explicit:</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/6">&#8220;There is clear evidence that the ending of the school sport partnerships funding has had a negative impact&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/7">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/8">&#8220;School sport is too important to rely on occasional efforts at pump-priming&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/9">Its starkest warning of all was:</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/10">&#8220;We believe that the opportunity to realise a London 2012 legacy for school sports has not yet been lost&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/11">It said that in 2013. Well, it has now been lost because that warning was ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/12">The Secretary of State used to chair the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Even that Committee warned last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/13">&#8220;We are very concerned about the lack of communication and co-operation between Government departments, which we think presents a serious obstacle to the DCMS in its attempts to deliver the Olympic legacy.&#8221;</p>

Unfortunately, however, the lack of access and opportunity prevents that from happening.

	<p pid="a.970.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and it is a delight to see her back in her rightful place in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.1/2">There are further dangers ahead. Let us take swimming, for example. As I said, this is the one sport in which participation among girls and boys is equal. Swimming is the most popular form of activity in this country, with 2.6 million people taking part every week. There are, however, many things that put people off swimming, including communal changing rooms, lack of privacy, tired facilities, never learning to swim in the first place, particularly among poorer families, and simply the cost of using a swimming pool. Every Member will have heard of the problems faced by local authorities in maintaining leisure centres, and many of us might have had to fight for swimming pools to stay open in our own constituencies. In fact, the number of pools is pretty stable, at about 5,000 in England alone. More than half of all local authority pools, as opposed to pools in expensive private members&#8217; clubs, were built before 1985 and require significant investment to continue to operate and be attractive to modern swimmers. There are dramatic challenges ahead in respect of just that one sport. We must ensure that more people go swimming.</p>

	<p pid="a.971.0/1">I think that all Members understand the basis of local authority funding, which is that 80% of it comes from Westminster and 20% from council tax and other sources. The problem is that&#8212;particularly in deprived areas where many people rely on council services for the elderly, for the protection of children and for their livelihoods and living standards&#8212;local authorities are under the cosh, and are finding it very difficult to maintain supposedly non-statutory services such as leisure and libraries.

	<p pid="a.971.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman will know, the latest Sport England data show that, in respect of the last two comparable years, he is quite right: the number of people involved in swimming did fall. However, the number of people involved in athletics, cycling, football, rugby and cricket rose. What analysis has he made of those statistics?</p>

	<p pid="a.971.2/1">I said earlier that the number of people involved in four sports had risen. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman about the football statistic, and I am quite happy to have a row with him about it. The overall point, though, is that fewer people are taking part in sport. We have not seen the dramatic increase for which we all hoped. We hoped that spending significant amounts, and diverting moneys from other lottery good causes, would produce a dramatic legacy, and that all the leadership shown by elite athletes would bear fruit in the form of a healthier nation, but that has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.971.2/2">What are we calling for? First, we are calling for a proper, 10-year sport strategy, with a particular focus on involving more women, on disability sport, and on those in areas of multiple deprivation and with the lowest incomes. I think that the sports Minister agrees with us, because she suggested some of that last week.</p>

	<p pid="a.971.4/1">If I am agreeing with the Minister and she is agreeing with me, this is quite a love-in&#8212;and all the more reason to support Labour at the end of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/2">Secondly, we are calling for a renewed determination to make the premier league divert more of the proceeds of its broadcast rights to grass-roots football, funding coaches, kit and pitches. Football does not belong to those at the top; it belongs to the kids who put up posters in their bedrooms, and to the parents who take them to play soccer every Saturday and Sunday morning and afternoon. It belongs to the grass roots, and more of the money should be going down to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/3">Thirdly, we are calling for immediate action to divert money away from dormant betting accounts and unclaimed betting winnings, and towards the grass roots of the 45 funded sports. Fourthly, we are calling for the restoration of two hours a week for sport and physical education at schools. We used to talk about five hours a week; is it too much to ask for two hours? Fifthly, we want the Government to set a proper target, and aim for an increase of 2 million in the number of people who take part in sport. Surely to God, we can get more of our countryfolk engaged in an active lifestyle.</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/4">Finally, we are calling on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department of Health and the Department for Education to present an annual report</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/5">on school sport to Parliament, so we can all agree on the facts, which would be brought to the House on a cross-party basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/6">Why does all that matter? A more active nation will be a healthier nation, see more people physically able to work, see fewer people succumb to long-term debilitating illnesses and see fewer people die prematurely. Engaging more people in a healthy lifestyle is the best, most effective and most efficient form of healthcare. If we want to tackle ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke and many mental health conditions, we have to build a healthier, more active nation. As Sport England put it:</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/7">&#8220;If a million more people across the country played sport each week, it would save the taxpayer &#163;22.5 billion in health and associated costs.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/8">Sport is an essential aspect of rehabilitation, improving people&#8217;s sense of self-worth and of wellbeing. As the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, under the current Secretary of State&#8217;s chairmanship, put it last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/9">&#8220;It is widely acknowledged that one of the major health issues facing the UK is the decline in physical activity by the population, leading to a rise in obesity and associated conditions.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/10">So it must surely be a scandal for all of us that we spend more in this country&#8212;three times more&#8212;on weight loss surgery than we do on the Change4Life health campaign. We should be spending more money on preventing obesity than on surgery to tackle it.</p>
	<p pid="a.971.4/11">I believe, therefore, that we should lead by example, so I make an offer to the Secretary of State. There will be a London marathon next year. I am quite happy to run, if he is happy to run.</p>

	<p pid="a.972.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> for giving the House this opportunity to celebrate not just the fantastic success of the London Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, but the amazing legacy that this country has enjoyed as a result. It is right that we consider it now: we are just over a year away from the Rio 2016 games, and it is a little more than three years since we hosted the games in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.972.0/2">There is not a lot in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s motion with which I disagree. It is unfortunate that he has adopted some rather snide language, as that makes it impossible for us to support it, but once once we take that out and remove the synthetic outrage that permeated many of his remarks earlier, we will find there is quite a lot of agreement across the House, and that, I hope, will come out. I certainly agree with the start of his speech, when he talked about the enormous success of the 2012 games. Without any question, they gripped the public&#8217;s attention and fired imagination right across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.972.0/3">Almost to the surprise and disappointment of some detractors in the press, we managed to construct the facilities on time and within budget, and we then had the superb organisation, for which congratulations are due not just to Lord Coe and Lord Deighton, but to the thousands of people involved in the games, both employees and volunteers. That sent a clear and long overdue message to the world that we can still put on a magnificent event with a degree of friendliness and good spirit, which impressed the whole world and showed that this country is prepared to welcome any visitors to our shores.</p>
	<p pid="a.972.0/4">Our athletes were outstandingly successful, coming third in the medals tables for both the Olympic and Paralympic games. One reason for the original success of our bid was that we put the question of legacy at the absolute core of our plans right from the start. I remember going to talk to a Greek Minister about the legacy of the Athens games, when he confessed to us that his main concern had been getting the facilities prepared in time and he had not even thought about what would happen to them afterwards. That was not the case here. We were always clear that legacy was at the heart of our preparation, and we focused in particular on regenerating a particularly disadvantaged area of east London, on our economy and the potential boost to tourism, on volunteering, on the lives and perceptions of disabled people and, yes, on sport, both elite and in terms of participation and healthy living. We have made strong progress on all those five themes.</p>
	<p pid="a.972.0/5">On the regeneration of east London, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase> has said, we have a secure future for each of the permanent venues on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Nearly 5 million people have visited the park since it reopened two years ago, including hundreds of thousands who have been able to swim in the aquatics centre or ride in the velodrome or on the BMX track. All eight of the permanent venues have their long-term futures secured, and this is the first time a host city has managed to achieve that within a year. In particular, we have secured a long-term future for the Olympic stadium itself&#8212;that has not always been the case for previous host cities. I can remember visiting the Olympic stadium in Athens, where grass was growing out of the running track.</p>
	<p pid="a.972.0/6">In the next two years alone, the Olympic stadium in east London will host the world athletics championships and five matches during the rugby world cup, including the semi-final. It will also become the permanent home to one of the UK&#8217;s most famous football clubs. In addition, the athletes&#8217; village has been converted into housing, with more than 4,500 people already living in this new community. We should also note that those residents will have not only world-class sport on their doorsteps, but world-class culture. The House will be aware that the Government are contributing towards the costs of a new cultural and educational quarter on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park&#8212;Olympicopolis. I am delighted that it will provide a new campus for my own university, University College London, as well as a campus for the University of the Arts London, and that already Sadler&#8217;s Wells and the Victoria and Albert Museum have committed to being a part of it. We are now in discussion with the Smithsonian about it establishing its first permanent museum outside the United States.</p>

	<p pid="a.973.1/3">Let me finish my remarks about the physical legacy by saying that the transport links to and from the park have also had a huge impact on that part of London. There has also been an economic legacy more generally. There is no doubt that the games provided a showcase for British business&#8212;in construction, in event management and across a number of other sectors. Where other countries have followed suit, in Rio, in Baku and in the Commonwealth games and elsewhere, it has often been the expertise that we have developed in this country that is now winning jobs and orders for this country across the world. The total international trade and investment benefits from the games and games-time activity has already exceeded &#163;14 billion, against an already ambitious target of &#163;l1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.973.1/4">The games were also the opportunity to show off the United Kingdom to the world and, as a result, we are on track to deliver tourism targets of an extra 4.7 million visitors, spending &#163;2.3 billion, over a four-year period. An evaluation of the legacy benefits from the games by an independent consortium has estimated that the total economic benefit in terms of UK gross value added will be between &#163;28 billion and &#163;41 billion over the period from 2004 to 2020.</p>

	<p pid="a.975.1/1">I can tell hon. Members of one economic benefit. There is a brand new half marathon in Swansea, which is now in its second year. That development certainly has a lot to do with the growth in athletics. Just this week, I ran round St James&#8217;s park in my Eastleigh 10 km T-shirt, trying to get back into running. There is a new all-party group of Members who want to return to running after the campaign. I would certainly like to see Members joining in if they are training for the London marathon. Innovation is really important, as, too, are the financial benefits. In Eastleigh, young women are returning to exercise. They are going to spin classes and bringing their babies with them. Innovation is certainly important.</p>

I am about to come on to the issue of sporting participation in due course. Before I do so, let me touch on one or two other aspects of the legacy, particularly the volunteering legacy, which was one of the most extraordinary achievements.</p>

	<p pid="a.975.6/1">Let me just point out to the hon. Gentleman that the title of his motion includes the words &#8220;2012 Olympics legacy&#8221;, so it is relevant to talk about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.975.6/2">On volunteering, one of the greatest successes of the games were the 70,000 games makers, who gave up their time and enthusiasm to make the games as welcoming as they were. They have left a very real legacy. We have seen games-makers style volunteers at the rugby league world cup, the Tour de France Grand D&#233;part, the Glasgow Commonwealth games and we will see them at the rugby union world cup this autumn. They have also inspired thousands of others to volunteer in their communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.976.0/1">It is extremely telling that the shadow Secretary of State had absolutely nothing to say about volunteering, because he does not want to talk about one of the great success stories of the games and of the legacy. Does my right hon. Friend agree that community-based sports volunteers have a crucial role to play in driving participation in sport?

	<p pid="a.976.1/1">Absolutely. I join my hon. Friend in welcoming that charity. He is being unduly modest in not taking credit for the part that he played in establishing that initiative. It is the case that volunteering is continuing, and that many, many grassroots sports clubs simply would not be able to survive without the efforts of hundreds, if not thousands, of volunteers. Like many Members in this House I suspect, I will be going this weekend to the rugby club in my own constituency to see the NatWest RugbyForce, which is renovating and working on that club. That initiative has been signed up to by more than 650 clubs.</p>

We see elite athletes all the way down to people at the opposite end of the spectrum, such as myself, riding out on Sunday.</p>

	<p pid="a.976.4/1">Before the Secretary of State moves on from the legacy, what does he have to say about the legacy for lottery-supported charities that are still hurting from the billions of pounds that were diverted from their activities and that are greatly concerned about how this is going to be resolved? What does he have to say to lottery-supported charities that feel they lost out so dramatically because of the London Olympics?</p>

	<p pid="a.976.5/1">One of the purposes of the lottery was to support sport in particular, as well as charitable activities, and it seemed to me to be an extremely good use of lottery money to invest in something that has produced such enormous benefit in many different areas. Also, the lottery will benefit from some return, once the sale of the Olympic village has fully gone through.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.5/2">To return to disabled sport and the Paralympics, one of my greatest moments was to have the opportunity to present flowers to some of the medal winners in the Olympic stadium during the Paralympics. The atmosphere</p>
	<p pid="a.976.5/3">in the stadium at that time was quite extraordinary. According to a survey taken the year after, more than half the population felt that the Paralympics had a positive impact on the way they viewed disabled people, and nearly a quarter of a million more disabled people are now playing sport than was the case when we won the bid 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.5/4">The hon. Member for Rhondda talked about the sporting legacy of the games. At the elite end, we have talked about the huge success of Team GB in the games themselves, but we have gone on from that. We are currently sitting fourth in the medal tables in Baku&#8212;I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase>, who attended the opening ceremony in Baku on behalf of the Government. As many hon. Members know, the England women&#8217;s football team is now playing in the World cup quarter final this weekend. We wish them every success. We achieved our best ever results at a winter games in Sochi; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all finished in the top 15 in the Commonwealth games medal table last year; and we are going to Rio next year in a spirit of optimism of even greater success.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.5/5">The hon. Gentleman addressed the question of participation levels. It is correct that the figures in the recent Active People survey are disappointing. There is no question but that one of the prime aims of the games was to increase participation, and we did achieve that: there was a huge boost to participation after the games. As has already been pointed out, some 1.4 million more people are participating in sport than when we won the bid.</p>

	<p pid="a.977.0/1">The Secretary of State mentioned the Rio games next year. Does he see in the fact that they are fast approaching an opportunity to reinvigorate school sport in particular, so that we can get young people active and involved in sport, and fired up for the Rio games?</p>

	<p pid="a.977.1/1">I absolutely do. The games in London, and particularly some of the wonderful role models established in many different sports, certainly led to growing enthusiasm among young people, and hopefully the games in Rio next year will have a similar impact. Some of those effects are not picked up in the Active People survey, because young people do not yet come into the statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.977.2/1">The Secretary of State touched briefly on women&#8217;s participation in sport, but there is a key issue, to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> referred. We already had a gender gap of 1.8 million, and 200,000 fewer women are taking part in sport, but the only activities that are growing are things like park runs and the 10 km runs hon.

	<p pid="a.977.3/1">I agree, which is why the Select Committee that I chaired in the last Parliament carried out an inquiry on women and sport. As the hon. Member for Rhondda mentioned, the barriers to women&#8217;s participation are varied. A lot have to do with image,</p>
	<p pid="a.977.3/2">embarrassment, and the nature of the facilities available. It is a complicated picture. That is certainly something that I am keen to see addressed.

	<p pid="a.978.4/1">There is a real risk of everyone being a bit negative about the legacy of the Olympics.

	<p pid="a.978.7/2">&#8220;Ensuring a positive legacy from the Olympic Games for a host city&#8230;is very important&#8230;This is why I am delighted to see that our British partners have succeeded in maximising the legacy of London 2012 across a number of different areas&#8230;I see that London and Britain have also understood that the Games can be a catalyst for positive long-term economic, social and sustainable legacies.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.979.0/1">M&#242;ran taing, Mr Deputy Speaker. Thank you for this opportunity to give my maiden speech and hopefully inject notes of calm and good sense in what has been a very robust debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/2">I am the first woman to rise to speak in this place representing Edinburgh North and Leith and, I believe, the first woman to represent any part of my constituency in this House. I am pleased to play my small part in changing politics by making the profile of the population of this place more closely match the profile of the population that we serve, and I am absolutely delighted to represent Edinburgh North and Leith. My immediate predecessor was of course Mark Lazarowicz, who represented the constituency for some 14 years and was held in high regard by many of my constituents. I wish him very well in his future endeavours.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/3">Mr Deputy Speaker, you may have heard in recent weeks a succession of Members extolling the virtues of their constituencies and claiming them to be unsurpassed. That can only be because they have not yet visited my constituency. From the elegance of Edinburgh&#8217;s New Town&#8212;completed a couple of centuries ago, but still the new town to us&#8212;to the Shore at Leith, which may have been tamed a little in recent years but still loudly proclaims its independence from Edinburgh, despite the treachery of 1920, my constituency embraces variety, and rebellious spirits are cheek by jowl with more douce residents. It hugs the Forth from Seafield to the Birnie rocks at the foot of Granton, and that relationship with the firth and the sea has shaped the place. International trade in and out of Leith for centuries meant that our links were well enough established that when England took the huff with France and banned claret, we imported it in vast quantities and smuggled it into England&#8212;keeping the best for ourselves, of course.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/4">The people of my constituency have always been inventive and resilient, and those qualities have served us well over the years, but it seems we will need them afresh now. While Edinburgh North and Leith has areas of affluence and more than its fair share of professionals from the legal and financial worlds, it also has areas of poverty and deprivation, and communities full of people whose life experiences are not comfortable. In my few weeks as an MP and in my role as a councillor before that, I have seen people in desperate situations. They face grinding poverty and their hope has been bulldozed from their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/5">In 1922, James Maxton rose to make his maiden speech here and talked of the people of Glasgow living in poverty, with the equivalent of benefit sanctions forcing children to the parish council to be fed, just as they are now being sent to food banks. A century on, and it seems little has changed. The voices of the Red Clydesiders would still be regarded as revolutionary in here.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/6">The Chancellor recently informed the House that he intends to cut more deeply than he already has&#8212;that the austerity orgy would continue. Leaving aside the fact that austerity has never worked, and wherever it has been tried it has caused long-lasting damage, we can perhaps look at the human face of the cuts&#8212;the suffering and the misery&#8212;and decide that we should decide a different path; that we should choose a different future.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/7">In his maiden speech, Maxton said:</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/8">&#8220;We have had many lectures on etiquette, manners and conduct from right hon. Gentlemen in all parts of the House, and from the Press of this city, addressed particularly to those of us who come from the West of Scotland. We admit frankly that perhaps on the nicer points of good form we have different ideas from hon. Members on the other side of the House. Our dialect is somewhat different also, and perhaps our mode of dressing is slightly different. But we think it is the very worst form, the very worst taste, that it shows very bad breeding, to kick a man who is in the gutter, or to withdraw a crust from a starving child.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1922-12-08.2231"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 December 1922; Vol. 159, c. 2231-32</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/9">We have had something similar here in the past few weeks. We on the SNP Benches may not have the delicacies of this House&#8217;s customs and manners perfected, but we too think it is the very worst form, the very worst taste, and that it shows very bad breeding to kick people who are in the gutter or to withdraw a crust from a starving child.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/10">We might have been entitled perhaps to expect that the loyal Opposition would have had something to say about the crushing weight that austerity is for the poor. We might have expected a party that was built on a promise of creating fairness in society to consider that it had a duty to stand up for those with least. Instead, today we find ourselves with a motion in the name of the interim Leader of the Opposition that talks of the supposed squandering of the London Olympic legacy. Given the amount of infrastructure spending that was denied other areas of the UK, as we have heard, to be focused on London for those games, some of us may be forgiven for asking whether the legacy in question should be thought of as a positive one.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/11">I shall be generous, though, and leave that aside, and say that creating the next generation of athletes, elite and otherwise, and improving the health and wellbeing of our people cannot be done unless there is investment in facilities, in coaching provision, and in society. For a child lacking nourishment is far less likely to perform well at any sport, never mind excel, and a parent queuing up at a food bank is not really in the best position to encourage their children&#8217;s participation in sport. The same applies to education, health, and life chances. Poverty kills hope, kills opportunity, and smothers ambition. We have to do exactly the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/12">It seems to me that we stand at a crossroads&#8212;a junction of decision&#8212;but our duty could not be clearer. We have an obligation to offer hope and ambition. We cannot be the doom-mongers, the nay-sayers, the harpies of hardship. We should be lighting the way to a better future for individuals and communities. A broken society, shackled to a future of despair and trying to hold itself together by its fingertips, is surely too high a price to pay for a marginally improved economic performance now, even if austerity could work. The orgy of cuts must end and rebuilding what has been broken must start. That has to begin with investment in our infrastructure, in our public services and most urgently of all, in our people. No more despair, no more distrust&#8212;it is time to invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/13">I say to Members on both sides of the House that we have a chance now to make sure that Maxton is not still relevant in another century, and that there is a different way. Come to Scotland. Find a politics that has been rescued by hope, where people are engaged and talking about the future and possibilities. While Members are there, they can take a look at the investment that the</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/14">Scottish Government have made in community facilities through the Cashback for Communities scheme, financed by money recovered from the proceeds of crime. The next generation are being given somewhere to hone their talents, somewhere to get fit and somewhere to respect each other. Come to Scotland and see the difference it makes, and while you are there, come and see Edinburgh North and Leith. It is the best constituency in the country. I will show you around and let the people tell you that they need more than you are offering, and then you can come back here and make a difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/15">We Members were not sent here to mark time and hope that we get out the other end unscathed. We were sent here to do a job. The people we represent need more from us than we have given so far. They need hope. The question for each of us in this House is: are we good enough to deliver that hope, to offer it? If people cannot look to Parliament, they will look elsewhere. If we cannot offer hope or its associates, we will be offering exactly the opposite: alienation. Failure to act would be a crime against society, a demonstration that we are incapable of mending that which we have broken.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/16">I appreciate that the election of so many SNP Members must have seemed, to some honourable incumbents, akin to an uprising. I have heard it called &#8220;Ajockalypse Now&#8221;. We may have ruffled a few feathers since we got here, but I really want to extend a hand of co-operation around this House. Anyone who would like to work with us to address poverty, reverse the effects of austerity, and start building for a future where we can do such things as improve the health and wellbeing of all the nations of the UK through encouraging physical activity, will be more than welcome. This is not a one-time offer, nor is it a deal that ends at midnight; this is an offer that lasts. For those interested in taking society forward, work with us, and by God, we&#8217;ll work with you.</p>

	<p pid="a.981.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25336" name="Deidre Brock">the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)</phrase> on a rather challenging maiden speech&#8212;perhaps not in the best traditions of the House, but I congratulate her on putting her points over in a forceful way.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/2">Looking at the legacy of the Olympic games is one of the most important things to do. My noble Friend Lord Coe opened the 2012 Olympics by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/3">&#8220;London 2012 will inspire a generation&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/4">and he was right. Our games inspired people not just in the UK, but abroad as well, and we should be very proud of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/5">It was the very first &#8220;legacy games&#8221;, with the legacy, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, built in from the outset. It challenged an outdated, crusty image of a faded Britain and it demonstrated that after a great recession, Britain was open for business, once more thriving and leading the world, not only in sports, but through its Cultural Olympiad, its culture and its arts. It regenerated huge swathes of our capital city and gave us pride in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/6">The success of the London 2012 Olympics for Britain was not a success just for one political party or another, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> might like to imply. It was a success for the whole nation, because it brought our nation together. We presented ourselves to the world with confidence, passion, professionalism and, above all, fun.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/7">I am somewhat surprised at the focus of the Opposition motion. It rightly talks about the importance of the Olympic legacy, yet in his opening statement, the hon. Member for Rhondda talked about very little of that legacy. He talked simply about increasing participation in sport, which, although important, is only one part of the Olympic legacy that he should have covered. He fundamentally missed the true scope of the legacy of the event. He should perhaps put that right later on.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/8">The motion states that the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/9">&#8220;squandered the Olympic legacy it was bequeathed in 2010&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/10">which was some two years before the games were held. In fact, participation in sport has increased by 1.4 million people since the London bid won in 2005. I fear that the shadow Secretary of State is breaking the first rule of his job by trying to score political points off the back of sport. It simply does not work and he should not do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/11">I will make three observations in the short time available to me. We should continue to be proud of the success that was London 2012 and should not pull it apart. A lasting legacy was built in from the start and, as we have heard, it has been hailed as a blueprint for future hosts by the International Olympic Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.982.0/1">My right hon. Friend said that to ensure that there is a legacy, it must be built in from the start. Does she therefore agree that the Rugby Football Union was right to appoint a legacy group for the upcoming rugby world cup, which means that the advantages of the tournament will be seen in future years, in exactly the same way as she is describing in respect of the Olympics?</p>

	<p pid="a.982.1/1">I could not have put it better myself. My hon. Friend is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.1/2">There are other parts of the legacy, such as the cultural Olympics, increased participation, and the challenge to the way in which disabled people are viewed, so that people are viewed for what they can do, rather than for what they cannot do. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11792" name="Nick Hurd">the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase> mentioned the importance that was attached to volunteering, which successfully reversed a long-term decline started under a Labour Government, resulting in more people putting themselves forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.982.3/1">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I will continue because other Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.3/2">We have touched briefly on women&#8217;s sport. The Olympics challenged the views of the media and sponsors on the appeal of women&#8217;s sport. About 40% of the UK&#8217;s medals were won by women and the audience levels that those events commanded demonstrated the huge, untapped appetite for mainstream coverage of women&#8217;s sport. I applaud the BBC and Sky Sports for the work that they are doing, which I am sure they will continue, to put women&#8217;s sport at the forefront.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.3/3">London 2012 put Britain on the world stage and promoted the regeneration of one of the poorest parts of our capital city, but Members are right to say that we need to scrutinise carefully the investment that is being made into increasing participation in sport, because we are putting a huge amount in. We are investing &#163;1 billion in youth and community sport through to 2017 to instil a sporting habit for life. We need to hold the national governing bodies to account for the money they are spending and the work they are doing on our behalf.</p>

	<p pid="a.983.0/2">I welcome the sports Minister and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to their roles. I hope that the sports Minister will continue in the long tradition of sports Ministers working across the political parties. I also hope that she will try, as many of us have over the years, to get the Department of Health, the Home Office, the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to work together, because together we can solve a lot of problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.983.0/3">I am sad that we have used the word &#8220;squandered&#8221; in the motion. If I am honest, I do not think that that is a sensible word to use. This is a difficult issue. A legacy is not something that happens overnight, but something that has to be worked at. All the people who were involved in the Olympics knew that increased participation would not simply happen just because a few people won a few gold medals. That is not how it is done. We have to start from the bottom up.</p>

	<p pid="a.983.1/1">The hon. Lady has a passionate interest in shooting sports.

	<p pid="a.983.2/1">I am a great supporter of shooting sports and the discipline they bring. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman mentioned that gold medallist, because he comes from an area I know very well in Northern Ireland, and I know that it brought great pleasure to people there.</p>
	<p pid="a.983.2/2">I want to say a few words about how I think we can get a legacy. I will point to London. As many Members will know&#8212;some Opposition Members were not too happy about this&#8212;I have been the Mayor&#8217;s commissioner for sport. I wanted very much to ensure that the Olympics would leave a legacy for grassroots sport. I genuinely congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999" name="Boris Johnson">the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase>, because when he became Mayor there was no sports unit at the city hall and grassroots sport was not seen as important; there was something going on about the Olympics, but grassroots sport did not really matter. He made sure that we had some ring-fenced money, and with that we were able to work with Sport England, local authorities and the London Marathon Charitable Trust, for example, bringing a co-ordinated approach to try to get London</p>
	<p pid="a.983.2/3">to speak with one voice, because one of the crucial problems was that London was not speaking with one voice.</p>
	<p pid="a.983.2/4">As a result of all the money that has gone in&#8212;the &#163;20 million, the extra &#163;30 million in additional match funding and the investment in sports facilities, such as our mobile swimming pools, and in different sports right across London&#8212;we are the only part of the United Kingdom where participation has increased. However, that alone will not solve the problem. We really need to look at what makes it work. We have to get local authorities to see sport and physical recreation as a priority. I am delighted that Southwark, a Labour borough, has just decided to introduce free swimming, so local authorities can do more if there is the push and the intention to make it happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.983.2/5">It is very important that we look at our schools. I remind Members that I was the sports Minister when the school sports co-ordinators were introduced. The reality is that it was never meant to be long term; it was meant to raise the standard in schools, so that they themselves could help make sport and physical recreation a really important part of school. I welcome the ring-fenced money&#8212;the only money that goes to schools that is ring-fenced, at just over &#163;8,000 for each primary school. In London alone, &#163;15 million is therefore invested in school sport. If those 1,900 primary schools work together, as they have been doing in some areas, we will see a huge amount of good things going on.</p>

	<p pid="a.984.0/1">One of the recommendations of the Education Committee&#8217;s report on school sport and the Olympic legacy in the previous Parliament was the need to extend the woefully small amount of training that primary school teachers, in particular, receive in physical education. I wonder whether the hon. Lady would like to comment on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.984.1/1">Training is absolutely crucial, and I used to be a qualified physical education teacher, back when we had physical education colleges that taught it in a much better way than it is taught now. Teaching physical education in our primary schools is important. Money is hugely important, but this is also about people and about motivation, getting people to want to instil in young people an enjoyment of sport early on. That is what we have to work towards.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.1/2">One of the things we are doing in London that is really crucial relates to major sporting events, which are very important and draw millions of people to London. We have to ensure&#8212;the Mayor has made this happen&#8212;that no big sporting event comes to London without the governing bodies first having to prove what they will do for grassroots sport and what will be the legacy, so it is not just a case of people coming along, having a wonderful two or three days and then nothing happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.1/3">The thing that I am most proud of in London is that we have finally brought together what would be called the county sports partnerships outside London and the pro-actives in London under something called London Sport&#8212;Sport England wanted that to happen as well&#8212;so we now have a partnership right across London. Instead of people coming to London and thinking, &#8220;We have to go to all these different London boroughs,&#8221; we will all be working together to ensure that the money goes a lot further. That is absolutely crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.1/4">I do not think that we should be negative. I genuinely think that sport is one of those matters that we should be able to have a mature debate about, rather than just playing ping-pong with statistics. We should be able to work together closely. I suggest that one of the things the Secretary of State might want to do is have a proper, full debate in Government time, so that we do not have to rush through things in three or four minutes. Members could then have a proper discourse and welcome the fact that sport does so much in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.985.0/1">This is an important debate, because participation in sport is not simply about improving elite sport or the success of our Olympians and footballers and cricketers at an elite level. It not only improves people&#8217;s health and wellbeing but all the studies show that it is incredibly important in turning around the life chances of many young people, including those who have been involved in crime or who have fallen out of education. It gives them back structure and confidence, and that is why it is such an important part of the fabric of our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.0/2">Of course, we should be ambitious to increase participation in sport and we should hope to see a boost in that, particularly after the incredible success that was the London Olympic games. We can look at the figures in Sport England&#8217;s most recent study on sports participation and say that we would like to be doing better. That should be our aspiration.

	<p pid="a.985.3/1">The hon. Gentleman mentions football, but does he not think that we have things to learn from other countries? I believe that in Belgium the aim is that any 19 or 20-year-old from across society will have touched the ball in football about 200 million times. That is building quite a high pyramid of talent, as we have seen in the Belgian national team at the moment, from what is being done at the grassroots. We could and should be learning from other countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.985.4/1">I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman says. Last Friday, I was in Folkestone to see the opening of the new 3G football pitch at Cheriton Road. We want to see more investment in such pitches. The Government have provided an additional &#163;8 million for such facilities, but we should see more. I agree with the hon. Member for Rhondda that with all the billions of pounds coming into football we should get more of that money into the grassroots. We all want to see that. In his excellent book, &#8220;Bounce&#8221;, Matthew Syed gives a clear analysis of sports participation. Proximity to good coaches and facilities and the opportunity to engage increase the number of people who will participate</p>
	<p pid="a.985.4/2">and makes it more likely that we will find elite performers from almost any walk of life. It is a question of getting the combinations right.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.4/3">Participation, which was mentioned by the Secretary of State, is important. The participation figures, as they are collected by the national sports bodies, are something of a blunt tool. One person who participates in three sports might decide to concentrate on one and spend more time on that one sport than they did on the three, but that is shown as a net drop in participation even though the hours involved in sport might have gone up.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.4/4">We should be targeting interventions to get people who do no sport at all to start doing something, and we should focus on the most deprived communities, where people do not have access to facilities, coaches or the opportunities to participate. That agenda was set out by the previous Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, and I think that it will be an important step forward in how we incentivise investment to get people who play no sport to play some sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.4/5">We should question whether voluntary groups and charities should be able to access some of that funding and whether they are better placed to tackle some of the harder-to-reach places than the national governing bodies. Some of those organisations are supported by some of the national sporting bodies. For example, the Rugby Football Union&#8217;s HITZ programme has done a fantastic job in supporting young offenders and focusing their lives around sport. Kicks, the Premier League&#8217;s programme, has done a fantastic job. There have been some excellent studies of its benefit in London in reducing crime and antisocial behaviour. That should be our priority and our focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.4/6">School sport is important, but encouraging people to partake in sport outside school is even more important. There will only be a certain number of hours in the school day, so participation outside school is significant. A lot of good work has been done by the school sports partnerships, but the link between schools and sports clubs in the community is important.</p>

	<p pid="a.986.0/1">Last Friday, 2,200 children took part in the Hampshire youth games. One of the best things to see was the link with the sports clubs that volunteered and ran the different sports, such as the Trojans club in my constituency, which spent all day running the hockey.</p>

	<p pid="a.986.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. In my constituency, an organisation called the Shepway Sports Trust is independent of the council and the schools. It is supported by funding from the Roger de Haan Charitable Trust, but it seeks funding from other sporting bodies as well. Its primary purpose is to connect schools with sports clubs, to drive up participation in sports outside school, as well as proactively recruiting new coaches. An organisation can have all the facilities in the world, but if it does not have the coaches to lead people through its programmes, they will not get the best out of it. That is the kind of co-ordinated approach that we need to see, with a focus on increasing participation among people who are outside the organisations that qualify for support and those who have otherwise missed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.986.1/2">We should look at the sports in which participation has increased over the past couple of years, particularly those I mentioned earlier. Has that increase happened because they invest in community facilities or because they link up sport in schools with sport in clubs? What lessons can be learned, and how can we match funding to increase participation?</p>
	<p pid="a.986.1/3">How can we set about getting funding from other areas of Government activity? Why should not people be able to get Home Office funding for sports programmes set up to deal with antisocial behaviour and crime in the community? Why should not the Justice Department pay for some of the work of programmes such as HITZ, which is turning round the lives of young offenders? Reports reveal incredible statistics, showing that one or two big successes in keeping a young person from reoffending can almost pay for an entire year&#8217;s programme in the community. Relatively small amounts of money are involved, but the return that we get on the investment in community sport is enormous. That should shape our strategy. I have had a couple of extra minutes as a result of taking interventions, so I shall call it a day now.</p>

	<p pid="a.987.0/1">It is good to see that the cross-party consensus that won us the Olympics is still alive this afternoon. I have heard a bit of grumbling, but I am not going to grumble about money going into east London for the Olympics because my constituents and I loved the Olympics. Nor will I be grumbling about money going to Glasgow for the Commonwealth games; we loved them as well. I am sure that the Ministers would agree that it was part of the deal, when we all backed those games so unanimously, that areas such as mine that have not had the honour of hosting such events will have higher priority in the coming years, and I look forward to that happening. As we find that we want various things, I hope that the Ministers will be prompting and pushing to ensure that we get them.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/2">I hope that, when the Government re-examine their strategy, they will acknowledge that the increase in pitch prices is a problem that has to be addressed, because it is turning people away from sport. I also hope that they will admit their error on school sports co-ordinators. It is honourable for new Ministers to admit that errors were made by others in the past, and to make changes. That was a serious error, but something can now be done to improve the situation. There has been a tail-off in participation in schools as a result of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/3">Since the banking crisis, a lot of families have had a lower income. That means that the poorest in society&#8212;the lowest 20% in terms of income&#8212;are spending between &#163;2 and &#163;4 per household per week on sport, and they are suffering disproportionately from the lack of access. StreetGames is a charity that I know the new sports Minister has great affection for, and I hope that it will get more resources. It has produced an equity index on volunteering which shows that the brilliance of volunteering disproportionately benefits those in higher-income areas and works against those in the lowest-income areas. So the poorer you are, the less likely you are to benefit from volunteers and the less likely it is that you will participate in sport. One of the key reasons that the BBC needs to retain the major sports events as free to view is that</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/4">those on the lowest incomes cannot afford to watch pay-per-view events. They would be still further excluded from major sporting triumphs such as the Olympics if the BBC were to lose those free-to-view events. That is a vital choice for the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/5">UK Sport&#8217;s gold event series has 70 events over the next six years, and the Government must give more of a push to that. Its pop-up rugby league sessions, in conjunction with the Chorley Panthers, were a great success, as I am sure its pop-up tennis will be, across the country, coinciding with Wimbledon. The shortly-to-emerge Bassetlaw sports village is not there yet, but it is on its way. It will have an athletics track and an all-weather football stadium, putting the resources back where they are needed. When we did it before, with girls&#8217; football at Manton miners welfare club, we saw the biggest increase in girls&#8217; participation in the football world. Give us the tools and the facilities, and the people will come forward to participate in sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/6">Finally, I say to anyone out there who has not participated in sport that the all-party group on mountaineering will take you up to the hills. Anyone can participate&#8212;do join us.</p>

	<p pid="a.988.0/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to make my maiden speech. I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25336" name="Deidre Brock">the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)</phrase>, who spoke so eloquently in her maiden speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/2">It is a great honour and privilege to be here as the new Member for Cheadle. Cheadle is a vibrant and beautiful constituency situated in Greater Manchester and on the border with Cheshire. It is a constituency that values communities and volunteering, business and enterprise, parks and sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/3">I pay tribute to my predecessor, Mark Hunter, who represented Cheadle for 10 years. He will be remembered not only for his party role here as deputy Chief Whip, but for his hard work in the constituency. Like his Liberal Democrat predecessor, Patsy Calton, he used his maiden speech to highlight the need for a major relief road through the constituency. I am delighted to say that, after waiting decades for this vital relief road to Manchester airport, it is now off the drawing board and under construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/4">My constituency is made up of a number of villages and small towns. It has a long and interesting history, but before hon. Members become concerned that I may be tempted to narrate it in its entirety, I am aware that my time is limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/5">My constituency stretches from Woodsmoor, parts of Hazel Grove and Davenport, on the outskirts of Stockport, right down to Heald Green, Cheadle Hulme and Woodford on the Cheshire border. Indeed, for some of my constituents, their feet may be in Stockport, but their hearts are still in Cheshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/6">The settlements of Cheadle and Bramhall date back to Domesday records, and the village of Woodford has a proud history, too. It was formerly the home of aircraft manufacturers Avro, and at its height in the second world war more than 29,000 people were employed at the site and more than 20,000 aircraft were manufactured there, including Lancaster bombers, Vulcans and Nimrods.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/7">Communities are really important to me, and the Cheadle Civic Society is a great example of community in action. Formed more than 50 years ago, its aims are to encourage higher standards of architecture and planning in the village. Recently, its dedicated members and volunteers invested more than &#163;100,000 in bringing new life to the village green.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/8">Indeed, it is in our parks and clubs that the Olympic legacy is most clearly visible in my area&#8212;from the cricket clubs of Cheadle Hulme and Woodford receiving grants for improved facilities, to local cyclists benefiting from the excellent new BMX track in the award-winning Bruntwood park.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/9">Our amateur football clubs are also important. They include well-known teams such as Cheadle Town FC, who last season hosted the Russian under-19 team. We wish the number 19 had been reflected in the score, as Cheadle were unluckily beaten 22-0. However, pride was restored when the home goalie was named man of the match. When asked why he thought the Russian team had won, he said that the under-19s had the wind behind them. How unlucky it was that the wind turned around at half time.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/10">I have a number of aims that I want to achieve for my constituency. For example, there are many small businesses in the area and their enterprise needs to be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/11">I am proud to represent Cheadle, where communities value their local parks, sports clubs and the facilities they provide. There is a great spirit of volunteering by people who give freely of their time, which was demonstrated to great effect in the games. As I serve the residents of Cheadle, I will do all I can to support and promote the spirit of volunteering and community.</p>

	<p pid="a.989.0/1">I am proud to follow <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25405" name="Mary Robinson">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mary Robinson)</phrase>, who made an excellent speech, speaking eloquently about her constituency, its character, its history and its needs. I am sure she will have a successful Parliament standing up for her constituency. I congratulate her on her speech and on her election to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/2">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate, and not least to pay tribute to Feltham&#8217;s own Mo Farah, who, in his success in the Olympics and in other competitions since, has shown his commitment to sport and excellence, which continues to inspire many in my constituency, in Britain and throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/3">All hon. Members recall the Olympics&#8212;the excitement, the expectation and the pride. It was exciting to take part as the Olympic torch travelled around the country. Winning the Olympics was a truly national achievement. This week is national school sports week, which is an opportunity to send a strong message about sport and the importance of young people&#8217;s participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/4">That is why the sports legacy from the Olympics is sad in that participation has declined in almost every region and across a range of sporting disciplines, which has been mentioned consistently in the debate. It is saddening that the school sport partnerships had their</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/5">funding cut. I believe that that impacted on the ability of schools to participate in sports in the same way in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/6">Last year, I was proud to attend the launch of Motivate Hounslow, an important initiative that shows the need to motivate and encourage people to take part in innovations to bring about greater participation in support. The initiative was launched with Mo Farah and his former PE teacher, Alan Watkinson, who continues to play an important part in sports participation in Hounslow and in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/7">In the short time I have, I want to make a couple of points that have been made to me on the lack of a comprehensive strategy. There is a feeling that, in secondary schools, sports provision is in decline. There might be pockets of excellence, but provision is not reaching all areas. Participation has fallen in poorer areas and among those who are more deprived. That voice needs to be heard. We need to hear much more from the Government about how they will ensure that there is a comprehensive and longer-term strategy to encourage participation that takes advantage of our school system. We should ensure that there is a strategy for those aged 11 to 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/8">I recognise the work of the Youth Sport Trust, which has published a manifesto for PE and sports. This week, it launched &#8220;Class of 2035&#8221;, its report on young people&#8217;s relationship with physical activity, and on the need to think about how the digital revolution can be used to encourage PE and sports participation, and to empower young people to take part in, and responsibility for, their activity levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.989.0/9">This needs leadership from the top. We need the Government to show that they will take responsibility, so that we see not a decline but an increase in the years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.990.0/1">The debate has improved steadily as it has gone on, and Members on both sides of the House have made sensible points. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25405" name="Mary Robinson">the Member for Cheadle (Mary Robinson)</phrase> and to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25336" name="Deidre Brock">the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)</phrase> for their excellent maiden speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.0/2">The language in the motion is unfortunate. Most international observers would say that to say Britain has &#8220;squandered&#8221; the legacy of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games is utterly nonsensical. I think most fair-minded people would say there has never been an Olympic games of modern times that has produced such a substantial legacy of every kind.</p>

	<p pid="a.990.1/1">The idea of the legacy having been squandered cannot be true when one takes into account the transport logistics, the amazing Olympic volunteers&#8212;who were almost at the level of the absolute hero, Ben Parkinson, the torch carrier&#8212;and, thankfully for Twickenham, the Rugby world cup. We are benefiting from those transport logistics and the volunteers. Does my hon. Friend therefore agree that &#8220;squandering&#8221; is absolute rubbish?</p>

	<p pid="a.990.2/1">I wholeheartedly agree that &#8220;squandering&#8221; is totally wrong. The reason the International Olympic Committee said that London offers a blueprint to the</p>
	<p pid="a.990.2/2">rest of the world is that it has been around other post-Olympic cities and seen, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, the buddleia sprouting from the athletics tracks and the dustbowl stadiums. It has come to the Olympic park and seen the exact opposite: all seven key venues with a long-term private sector solution and contractor.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.2/3">Since the park opened only a year ago, 800,000 people have gone to the swimming pool, 600,000 have gone to the VeloPark, 600,000 to the Copper Box, and tens of thousands to the Lea Valley hockey and tennis centres. As Members have pointed out repeatedly, we are about the only Olympic city on record to have solved the problem of what to do with the stadium. We have a long-term future for the stadium, in spite of the catastrophic errors made by the previous Government. There will be not only premiership football, but rock concerts, baseball, rugby and all manner of entertainments. Our park in east London is going to be a centre of sporting excitement for generations to come. The Secretary of State rightly listed a procession of world championships: athletics, rugby, hockey, wheelchair rugby, swimming and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.2/4">We are succeeding in getting people from the poorest boroughs to play sport and to take part. Some 45,000 people have taken part in the Active People, Active Park project and 26,000 have enjoyed Motivate East, a programme to get disabled people more active in sport. I am absolutely confident, as my friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10282" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> rightly said, that those numbers will continue to rise. The area is changing out of all recognition.</p>

	<p pid="a.991.1/1">Absolutely&#8212;I acknowledge that completely. I acknowledge, too, the work of the grassroots sports teams. Much of that success flows from the increasing prosperity we are seeing in east London and at the Stratford site.</p>
	<p pid="a.991.1/2">The village is already complete and occupied, with 4,800 new inhabitants. We have the largest green park in the UK for a century. Some 24,000 homes will be built on the site, many of them low-cost and family homes. That would not have happened without the Olympics. We will have tens of thousands of new jobs as a result of the Olympicopolis project, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State identified and which the Government are rightly funding. Just this very morning&#8212;in another capacity, I am happy to say&#8212;I was privileged to give planning permission for a new tech hub on Fish Island in Hackney Wick, an absolutely beautiful structure that will echo the Victorian warehouses there and incorporate all kinds of artist studios and tech start-ups. It is inconceivable that that kind of private sector investment would have come to that part of London without the Olympics. That is a phenomenal legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.991.1/3">Two university campuses are going to the Stratford site: not just a &#163;270 million new campus for University College London, but a campus for Loughborough University, one of the great sporting universities in the world. Their mission is to help local kids to take up sport. I totally agree with the hon. Member for Vauxhall that taking up sport is not just a symptom of prosperity;</p>
	<p pid="a.991.1/4">it is a cause of prosperity. That is why she and I have campaigned so hard on this issue. I am proud to say&#8212;she is absolutely right&#8212;that we have had 400,000 more people doing some kind of sport since 2012 in London, which is a point that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> totally failed to concede. Sporting participation, as well as every other kind of legacy, is up in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.991.1/5">The London Olympic and Paralympic games of 2012 boosted sport across the city in which they were held. They are transforming east London and the lives of some of the poorest people in our society. As several Members have rightly pointed out, they have left a legacy of volunteering and engagement, which we are continuing to support through Team London, and they have brought untold billions of investment into this country. They projected an image of London around the world that was so attractive and so exciting that, for the third year running, we are going to achieve what we have never before achieved in my lifetime&#8212;to be the No. 1 tourist destination in the world, knocking Paris and New York off the No. 1&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.992.1/1">There is little doubt that the 2012 London Olympics inspired people. From the majesty of the opening ceremony featuring Britain&#8217;s greatest artistic talents through to the astonishing achievements of our athletes and of the world&#8217;s best sports people, it was impossible not to be inspired by the games, as I was inspired when I went to the Munich Olympics as part of the GB youth team.</p>
	<p pid="a.992.1/2">I am passionate about sport and the opportunity it gives to our children. Yet the legacy and the ambition of inspiring a generation to be physically active and to get hooked on sport have not been realised. Three conditions need to be met to encourage and enable people to be physically active: inspiration, access and infrastructure. Although there was no lack of inspiration present during and after the Olympics, the 2012 games were held in the early years of Tory austerity against a backcloth of crushing local government budget cuts, a strangulation of budgets within DCMS and the channelling of lottery funding to support the games themselves, so the other two conditions were missed.</p>
	<p pid="a.992.1/3">Across England, just as young people were being inspired to take up athletics, swimming and gymnastics, local councils were closing the doors on leisure facilities. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats were in charge for the 2012 Olympics, but they were also in charge for the unprecedented degradation of sports infrastructure across England, so the consequence of a Tory policy of promoting the Olympic games, but cutting off access to physical activity has contributed to a worsening of public health statistics and the deprivation of opportunities for people to be engaged in sport and physical activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.992.1/4">How can the people who have suffered hardest through austerity afford pitch fees, court fees, gym fees and equipment hire? How, as a consequence of this</p>
	<p pid="a.992.1/5">Government&#8217;s tearing apart of the welfare state, could people on the lowest incomes hope to access childcare in order to attend fitness classes or sports club activities? The lack of a coherent physical activity strategy during and after the Olympics demonstrates how the Government walked away from a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to inspire and activate a generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.992.1/6">In Wales, during the same period in which the previous UK Government stripped local government bare, the Welsh Labour Government protected council spending. This protected not only social care, in contrast to what happened in England, but sports and leisure centres. Protecting council budgets gave Welsh councils time to transform services and gave time for leisure and sports centres to be turned from making losses in some cases to making a profit that enabled trusts and social enterprises to be formed.</p>
	<p pid="a.992.1/7">The results of the Welsh Government&#8217;s continued support for their sports budget resulted in a record medal haul at the Glasgow Commonwealth games. Wales won 36 medals in total&#8212;20 bronze, 11 silver and five gold. This was more medals per capita than any other nation. Alongside this, levels of physical activity have increased since the Olympic games. The lesson of this contrasting picture on either side of Offa&#8217;s dyke is that investing in an event but afterwards cutting away access and infrastructure to the activities promoted by that event will achieve no positive legacy. In Wales, partnerships between the Welsh Government and the national governing bodies has led to a record number of 3G pitches being built, to multi-use leisure centres and learning centres opening in communities and to the location of cr&#232;che facilities within sports, leisure and library services.</p>

	<p pid="a.993.2/1">I am grateful to you for calling me, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I shall bear your stricture in mind. Of course I had a great speech to make, but given what you have said and given that some of what I was going to say has already been said more eloquently by others, I shall make just two points.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.2/2">It was a great privilege for me, nearly 10 years ago, to congratulate the then Secretary of State, Tessa Jowell, on bringing the Olympics to London, and on her assurance that the work to secure a legacy would be done on a cross-party basis. I therefore found it disappointing to see the word &#8220;squandered&#8221; in the motion. I do not think that any analysis of the regeneration to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred, along with the cultural legacy and the increase in participation that we have seen&#8212;notwithstanding some of the more recent falls&#8212;would prompt the use of that word. As Lord Coe said, the Olympics lit up the world and inspired a generation.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.2/3">Let me make a serious comment. Perhaps those who want to use the word &#8220;squandered&#8221; should consider the legacy itself. There are a couple of points that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> did not make in his speech. First, a legacy is not something that happens two or three years after an event. The legacy of the Olympics will be judged by whether we have champions in 2020, 2024 and 2028, because that is where the grassroots come in. However, the hon. Gentleman was right to say that from 2005 onwards&#8212;and, indeed, from 2012 onwards&#8212;participation in sport had increased, but since October 2014 the increase has begin to tail off. That information comes from Sport England&#8217;s campaign for active participation in sport. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman wants to query it, but it is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.2/4">The question that we must ask ourselves is whether we can sustain the legacy, and that is not true only of the Olympics. As many Members will know, I represent one of the greatest constituencies, and it is going to host a little tennis tournament next week. I remember being told time after time in the House that the legacy in that regard was that we were not producing champions, despite the money being spent year on year by the Lawn Tennis Association.</p>

	<p pid="a.994.0/1">In the context of participation in tennis, is it not a disgrace that the Labour-run council in my constituency closed the public tennis courts and then put money into private tennis courts that only the most affluent can afford?

	<p pid="a.994.2/2">My second aim in this short speech was to&#8212;well, to get the press release in, obviously. <i>(Laughter.) </i>I would have liked to say more about the legacy, but our legacy in Wimbledon is a new floodlit BMX track, which is open, is being used and has a growing membership, and the new beach volleyball courts that have opened in Wimbledon Park, which also has a growing membership. London, in contrast to a number of other places, is experiencing growing participation in sport, and I think that that is part of the Olympic legacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.994.3/1">I want to talk about women&#8217;s participation in sport. As I said earlier, 212,000 fewer women have participated since 2012. That is a real issue, because there is already a wide gender gap: 1.8 million fewer women than men engage in sport once a week, and 80% of women do not get enough exercise to benefit their health. That is why this is a serious issue, and that is why we should be discussing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/2">Even before the recent falls in participation, there were reasons for us to be concerned about the gender gap. Nationally, 40% of men participate in sport every</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/3">week compared with 30% of women, but the figures for women are much lower in some parts of the country. It is all very well for Conservative Members to talk about London, but the position is not the same in Greater Manchester, and it is not the same in Salford, where the figures are 20% and 24% respectively. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> said, the low participation rates in some parts of the country will lead to diabetes, coronary heart disease and strokes. That is why this is a serious issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/4">A number of barriers have been identified, as the Secretary of State said, to increasing female participation in sport, including practical, personal, social and cultural issues, but there are also financial reasons, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25332" name="Christina Rees">the Member for Neath (Christina Rees)</phrase> laid out so well. I co-chair the all-party group on women&#8217;s sport and fitness with Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. One of its three main aims is to investigate the participation of girls and women in sport and to reduce those barriers to participation. Its first meeting is next Tuesday and I urge hon. Members to attend, if they can, and to join if they care about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/5">I congratulate the new sports Minister on her role. I know she cares about these issues. She was a member of the all-party group in the previous Parliament, and she has said that the Government have an out-of-date sports strategy. She says she is going to rip it up and start again. I hope she does.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/6">The Minister might want to think about a couple of things as she does that. Unequal funding is the key issue running from school sports through to the unequal pay and poor sponsorship levels in elite women&#8217;s sport. Yesterday was the 43rd birthday of the Title IX legislation in the United States: landmark civil rights law that prohibits gender discrimination in any educational programme or activity that receives federal support. It has been law since <phrase class="date" code="1972-06-23">23 June 1972</phrase> and is famous for its transformative effects on girls and women&#8217;s athletics. The US has the highest level of participation of girls in sport in the world, largely due to Title IX bringing in equal funding for girls and women. Figures show that participation has increased by 990% in high schools and by 560% at college level since the law was passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/7">In this country, however, we do not have that law. We have very poor media coverage of women&#8217;s sport and a lack of sponsorship. The Select Committee that the current Secretary of State chaired looked at those issues, but we have to do something about it. The sports strategy must include working with the media to ensure better coverage of women&#8217;s events.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/8">Finally, on pay and sponsorship, the pay levels of women footballers playing in the women&#8217;s super league and in international competitions are very low and probably a surprise to many. The majority of centrally contracted players earn about &#163;20,000 from their clubs, but there are players in the super league who are on as little as &#163;50 a week. Those who are tempted to comment on the standard of women&#8217;s football need to think about that low level of reward. We won the women&#8217;s rugby world cup with a team who were not even paid professionally; nearly all of them had other jobs. How could any of us train and win at international level if we had other jobs to do?</p>
	<p pid="a.994.3/9">There are so many other issues we could talk about, and they will, I hope, be explored in other debates; that is a very sound idea. We will definitely explore them at future meetings of the all-party group.</p>

	<p pid="a.996.0/1">I, too, pay tribute to the wonderful maiden speeches that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25336" name="Deidre Brock">the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25405" name="Mary Robinson">the Member for Cheadle (Mary Robinson)</phrase> made. My hon. Friend has done tremendous work to enter the House, and I pay tribute to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.996.0/2">I cannot claim to be an elite athlete, but, along with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11093" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, I am proud to represent what I believe is the peak of all-party groups, as co-chair of the all-party group on mountaineering. As we consider the motion before us, we should be concerned about levels of sports participation, but <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> has missed the point and a real opportunity by focusing on, and calling on the Government to boost, participation in traditionally defined sports. That is important, but the real focus should be on getting people physically active&#8212;helping them to be less physically inactive. That has to be the focus, but it can be achieved only by looking at a much broader definition of sport, which includes recreation and, in particular, outdoor recreation. It is clearly time to think more broadly.</p>
	<p pid="a.996.0/3">The sports Minister has been on an heroic journey to climb Cotopaxi in Ecuador, where I know she developed a greater love&#8212;maybe that is too strong a word&#8212;for the outdoors, but I think that she, like many Members, understands the real importance of outdoor recreation. It leads to improved activity rates. Some 30% of the UK population is inactive. The figure for Scandinavia is only 8%, because people there have a broader sense of getting active outdoors. The &#8220;Moving More, Living More&#8221; document produced by the Department of Health shows that the costs associated with physical inactivity come to &#163;20 billion, so we should all have an interest in tackling that huge challenge. Clearly, there are also big health and wellbeing benefits to be had, through working with groups such as Age UK Cheshire East or the East Cheshire Ramblers and its 700 members. That is clear to all those who participate. It is clear to all of us who are involved with the outdoors that a vast blue and green gym outside this place is available to nearly all of us, if we just make that extra effort. I should also mention the benefits in another important area: the rural economy. The &#8220;Reconomics&#8221; report by the Sport and Recreation Alliance shows that outdoor recreation will boost the rural economy by &#163;21 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.996.0/4">There is good news, there is a clear opportunity and progress is being made. As I have said, there is clear cross-party support for making further progress in this area. We have had extensive debates in Parliament on this subject, notably on <phrase class="date" code="2015-09-20">20 September</phrase>, when <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11347" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> led an impassioned debate and many others joined in. There is a coalition of interested parties on moving this agenda forward, including the British Mountaineering Council, the Ramblers, the Youth Hostels Association and the Outdoor Industries Association. Last year, before the election, they made six key proposals for the Government to take forward, including measures on access and opportunities for young people. More than anything they wanted a clear focus. They were calling for a long-term strategy for outdoor recreation that is cross-departmental and that sits alongside or, even better, is integrated with the Government&#8217;s successful sports strategy. It was refreshing to see how the different Departments,</p>
	<p pid="a.996.0/5">from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to the Department of Health and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, are working together in this cause. We have an outstanding sports Minister and I give her every vote of confidence in the work she does. Please remember this broader definition of sport and recreation in that work.</p>

	<p pid="a.997.0/1">Many thanks for allowing me to participate in this debate, Mr Speaker. I do so as a keen sportsman and a true believer in sport as an essential element in building stronger communities, improving public health outcomes and teaching our young people the value of team ethics and fair play. In my younger days, I played rugby for London Welsh at junior level and for my college at university. Clearly, the motivation for doing so was partly that I was doing my constitutional and patriotic duty as a Welshman, but of course it was also based on my love of sport as a crucial feature of Welsh culture and identity. In my constituency, every weekend I see rugby&#8217;s power to bring our communities together across generations. Of course rugby is just one example of the power of sport as a unifying force for good.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/2">It is against that backdrop that I must express my deepest regret at the failure of the coalition Government to build on the Olympic legacy. The 2012 Olympics created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to improve the fitness levels of this country&#8217;s children and young people, but that opportunity was squandered by the coalition Government when they decided to scrap Labour&#8217;s school sport partnerships. Those partnerships played a crucial role in enabling primary school children to do competitive sport, and the decision to scrap them has led directly to the proportion of pupils doing two hours of sport a week collapsing from 90% under Labour to 50% under the last Government. Cuts to local authority budgets have also hit leisure centres and playing fields hard. In Wales, the &#163;1.5 billion cut to the block grant has had a deeply damaging effect. In my constituency, the Cymmer community pool is threatened with closure, much to the despair of the local community, who are fighting hard to find a way to keep their pool, which plays a crucial role in community life and public health, open.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/3">This Government must do better than their previous incarnation. The last five years saw a lack of strategy, piecemeal initiatives and announcements, and an absence of joined-up thinking. The coalition Government&#8217;s sports strategy can best be described as a litany of failure, with some of the lowlights including: scrapping Labour&#8217;s target for school children to do at least two hours of physical education and sport in school each week; undermining Labour&#8217;s successful school sport partnership, which was helping more children to do sport; watering down regulations on school playing fields; failing to carry out an audit of sports and recreation facilities available to local communities across the country; and failing to capitalise on the spirit and enthusiasm of the volunteer games makers.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/4">The concerns that I am expressing are not narrow party political points. On the contrary, they are felt by a wide range of stakeholders, including the Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell, who said back in 2013:</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/5">&#8220;I have grave concerns that cutting the funding to the School Sport Partnership network will have a hugely negative impact on the sporting opportunities that are available to our young people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/6">Chris Dunne, headteacher of Langdon Park School in Tower Hamlets, London, described the Government&#8217;s decision as an</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/7">&#8220;enormously destructive act, verging on vandalism.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/8">He said that it was a tragedy that sporting opportunities had been cut back dramatically after the games.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/9">The seductive vision was that the &#163;9.3 billion invested in the games would not only hasten the regeneration of a neglected corner of east London and unlock a host of other benefits, but act as a corrective in Whitehall to the attitude of politicians towards sport. No longer would sport be left at the back of the policy queue when it came to funding discussions. Instead, it would be incorporated into policies on fighting obesity, tackling crime, boosting educational achievement and bringing communities together. If we fast forward to 2015, we see that a properly integrated, properly funded, cross-departmental plan for sport and wellbeing remains as frustratingly elusive as ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/10">Meanwhile, childhood obesity rates continue to rise, PE in schools continues to decline, provision of facilities remains frustratingly patchy, and participation figures suggest a widening gap between the sporting haves and have nots.</p>

	<p pid="a.998.0/1">Let me make it clear at the outset that our reference in the motion is to sports participation. We bid for the Olympics because we understood all the wider aspects of the success of the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.0/2">We have had a wide-ranging debate with some very interesting speeches. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25336" name="Deidre Brock">the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)</phrase> on her maiden speech. She questioned whether there was a legacy from the Olympic games for Scotland. If she goes back and checks the figures, she will find that there was a considerable spin-off from the games. But the purpose of this debate is to find out how we can all benefit more widely from the legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.0/3">We also heard the maiden speech of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25405" name="Mary Robinson">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mary Robinson)</phrase>. She spoke very fondly and passionately about her constituency. I am sure that she will be a fine champion of her local residents and constituents in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.0/4">There have been a number of well-informed speeches. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">The right hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase> spoke about the wider generational issues. I found nothing in her speech with which I disagreed. The Olympic games will continue to benefit people more widely on a whole range of issues that go beyond sport, which is why investing and bidding for these major sporting events is so essential for the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.999.0/1">Absolutely, yes. A number of Members, especially <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24744" name="Damian Collins">the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)</phrase>, and my hon. Friends the Members for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and for Bassetlaw (John Mann), specifically referred to people at the grassroots of sport. I could not agree more with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25279" name="Nick Thomas-Symonds">the Member for Torfaen (Nick Thomas-Symonds)</phrase>, because it is time that we empowered those people. They are the ones who do the heavy lifting. They make a real difference in our communities. They know where the resources should go to make the biggest difference, and it is time that we had a long-term strategy for sport that empowered those people at local level, allowed them to make decisions about how resources are used and where they are targeted, and gave them oversight of local development plans for sport. When we use the term &#8220;sport&#8221; we must remember that we are talking about not just sporting activities but physical activities of all kinds. That point was made very well in one of the contributions.</p>

When we talk to people at the grassroots, the one thing they consistently say is that they want an end to the stop-start approach that they get from politicians. In saying that, they criticise us all, not just the current Government. We need what many speakers asked for: a long-term plan for sport, where all of us, in all parts of the House, agree on how we can take things forward and engage with people at the grassroots. It is an unfortunate fact that, in the past, the only consistency has been a consistent run of bad figures on participation since 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.0/3">Our motion focuses on participation. On the back of winning the Olympic bid, participation went up by 1.8 million people from 2005 to 2012, but since then participation figures have been going backwards. It is no good hon. Members saying, &#8220;Look at all the figures for transport, regeneration and jobs.&#8221; We accept all that&#8212;we are not criticising that side of it&#8212;but one of the targets for winning the Olympic games was to drive up participation. That worked from 2005 to 2012, on the back of winning the bid, but under this Government&#8217;s watch, since 2012, performance has not been good enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.999.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is saying some sensible things, but will he not, in all candour and intellectual honesty, admit that even since the 2012 games, there has been a continuous increase in sporting participation in London?</p>

	<p pid="a.999.2/1">I accept that there has been a boost in London, but we are looking at the overall figures. There are underlying issues, which were highlighted by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11943" name="Barbara Keeley">the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>. The figures for women&#8217;s participation are down, as are those for people with disabilities. There are some important issues that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.2/2">In a recent survey by the Chief Cultural and Leisure Officers Association, 70% of local authorities that responded said that they were looking to recover all or part of their costs through fees and charges. In the participation figures, the worst-affected sports tend to be those that rely heavily on local government facilities&#8212;sports such as gym exercise, dance, swimming, football and cricket. The impact is bound to be more severe on those who rely on those facilities&#8212;people from local</p>
	<p pid="a.999.2/3">income households. Nearly half a million fewer people participate in sport now than in 2012. It is that form of social exclusion that we should be tackling.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.2/4">I accept that the sports Minister was in earnest when she said that the figures are not good enough and that the Government have to accept part of the blame. Sport England has said that the figures are disastrous. We can bandy figures back and forth, but we have to accept that what people are looking for is consistency. All they have had consistently so far is bad figures, year after year since 2012. We need to work together on this. I wish the sports Minister all the best in convincing her right hon. and hon. Friends to give sport priority in the future, although I have to say that her predecessors failed woefully. I will be there supporting her all the way if she can convince them that we need a cross-Government, long-term plan for sport that we can all work towards.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.2/5">We need to empower the people who do the heavy lifting: the coaches, PE teachers, school games organisers, volunteers, people who run the clubs and classes, academics, businesses, local authorities and county sports partnerships. Incidentally, if anyone recognises any of this, it is similar to the points Steve Hilton was making just recently, only I wrote it all down a year ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.2/6">Sport governing bodies have a role to play. They have nothing to fear from being part of a strategy to increase overall participation, as they can then fish in a much bigger pool of talent for the next generation of elite athletes. We need a long-term plan, so that policy does not change every time we have a bad set of figures or the Minister changes. We need to empower the people at the grassroots, let them tailor what goes on in their area to meet local needs and oversee local sports plans, and trust them, because they can do it. Let us put the failures behind us. Let us do what people out there want us to do: trust them, and set out a long-term plan that we can all work towards, so that we get our nation healthy, happy and active.</p>

	<p pid="a.1000.0/1">This has, on the whole, been an excellent debate, not just because of colleagues&#8217; contributions, which I shall turn to shortly, but because despite the Opposition&#8217;s attempt to say otherwise, we have a good story to tell about London 2012 and its legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/2">I will briefly turn to the 13 contributions from the Floor of the House. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25336" name="Deidre Brock">the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Deidre Brock)</phrase> on her excellent maiden speech. I am very fond of Edinburgh, which has much sporting heritage of which to be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/3">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11389" name="Maria Miller">the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller)</phrase>, as a former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, brings real expertise and knowledge to the debate. I pay particular tribute to her&#8212;and indeed my predecessor, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24796" name="Helen Grant">the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant)</phrase>&#8212;for progressing the issue of women in sport; she was right to say that the Olympics started that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10282" name="Kate Hoey">The hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>, who was of course the first female sports Minister&#8212;I am merely the third&#8212;gave a brilliantly measured speech. I reassure her that there will be a proper cross-departmental approach to the strategy, and I certainly share her passion to increase grassroots sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24744" name="Damian Collins">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)</phrase> spoke incredibly well. I am hoping that if I say wonderfully nice things about his excellent speech, he will be very kind to me, now that he has been re-elected to the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/6">I know how incredibly passionate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11093" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> is about sport. He is a man of great foresight: we spent 21-odd days climbing a volcano for charity, and he lobbied me then on facilities for his constituency, 12 months before I was made a Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/7">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25405" name="Mary Robinson">the Member for Cheadle (Mary Robinson)</phrase> on her maiden speech. I was delighted to hear her story about Cheadle Town football club and its score line. I believe the club was founded as Grasmere Rovers. She should not worry about the 22-nil drubbing; I have been a manager when we have won with a similar score line, but I have also been a player when we have lost with the same score line. Both are equally embarrassing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25150" name="Seema Malhotra">The hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra)</phrase> made some very interesting comments. She has been in the House for a while now, but I must pay tribute to her late predecessor, Alan Keen, who also served on the Select Committee and was a real advocate for sport. She has picked up his baton wonderfully.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999" name="Boris Johnson">the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase> of course made an excellent speech about a legacy that he helped deliver. As Mayor of London, he gave us a memorable games, and he is right to be incredibly proud of all that the Olympics and Paralympics delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25332" name="Christina Rees">The hon. Member for Neath (Christina Rees)</phrase> was right to talk about the link between physical activity and health outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/11">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11927" name="Stephen Hammond">the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> was right to point out the long tail of the participation legacy. Those inspired by London 2012 may not yet be out of primary school. His points were well made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/12">I have worked incredibly closely with <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11943" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> on the issue of women in sport. She raised important issues. There has been progress, but challenges remain, and I look forward to working with her on those.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/13">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24820" name="David Rutley">the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley)</phrase> is a fantastic advocate for outdoor recreation, but it is his fault that my knees have not yet recovered from Cotopaxi.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/14">Finally, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25297" name="Stephen Kinnock">the hon. Member for Aberavon (Stephen Kinnock)</phrase> focused on school sport. I assure him that the Government have committed to funding the physical education and sport primary school premium for a further four years&#8212;something that Labour has not done. Furthermore, according to an independent assessment, 96% of schools reported improvements in pupils&#8217; fitness, and 91% observed an increase in the quality of PE teaching.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/15">If unnecessary attempts at political point-scoring were an Olympic sport, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase> would win gold every time. He has done his best to impugn the legacy of London 2012, but the simple truth is that we have a great deal to be proud of, and it is shame that the hitherto consensus has been</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/16">shattered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/17" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/18" class="italic">Interruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/19" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="a.1000.0/20">I will come to participation shortly, but the legacy is more than that. There is the legacy of the park, the village, business, volunteers and the collective knowledge accumulated by those who delivered the games. The park is outstanding, with wonderful venues that are open to the public to enjoy. The Olympic stadium has an exciting and sustainable future. Unlike so many previous host cities, there are no white elephants from London 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002.1/1">No, because I do not have much time&#8212;I am sorry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.1/2">The London 2012 games were the perfect showcase for the skills of our people and our businesses, which led to &#163;14.2 billion of trade and investment benefits to the UK. British business has already won &#163;60 million-worth of contracts for the Rio 2016 games, with up to another &#163;100 million to come. About 200 people who worked at London 2012 are helping to deliver the European games in Baku and assisting Rio in its preparations. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> If hon. Members will be patient, I will turn to participation shortly. As the Secretary of State said, games maker-style volunteers have become a fixture at major sporting events. London 2012 changed the perception of volunteering, and the nation has embraced it&#8212;a direct legacy that appears to have been forgotten by the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.1/3">I now turn to participation. I am happy to have an open and honest debate on this. The fact is that 1.4 million more people playing are sport than in 2005, and sport participation has increased by 300,000 since October 2010. Yet that is not enough&#8212;it is as simple as that. London 2012 has, without doubt, inspired many people to get involved in Olympic and Paralympic sports. There has been an increase in the number of people doing athletics, cycling, archery, judo, sailing and many other sports. Let us not forget, though, that inspiration and measurement do not always run concurrently. The girls I met in my local boxing gym are in the ring because of Nicola Adams. They are not measured on any survey because they are under 14. We will have examples like that from all our constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.1/4">The strapline of London 2012 was &#8220;Inspire a Generation&#8221;. The participation results show that our 16 to 25-year-olds are, on the whole, &#8220;steady&#8221;. That is good, but not good enough. When the last active people survey results were issued a couple of weeks ago, I made it clear that I am not happy with the decline in the number of people participating in sport. However, let us be clear: the last time an all-encompassing sports strategy was drawn up was in 2002, and it has been the template for sport delivery since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.1/5">Clearly, as the Opposition have admitted today, their strategy is not delivering. This Government have been working on the basis of a strategy that was delivered in 2002 and is no longer fit for purpose. So I have ripped up the old strategy, and before the recess I shall publish a consultation on a brand new sport strategy that will reform how we deliver sport in this country. I am sure the Opposition will embrace this opportunity to revive the consensus that helped deliver such a successful games.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.1/6">We are absolutely committed to continuing to make the most of the opportunities that London 2012 gave us and to make sure that generations to come benefit from</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.1/7">that fantastic summer three years ago. It is unfortunate that through the wording of their motion the Opposition sought to denigrate the legacy of London 2012. For that reason, we shall oppose the motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1008.2/1">The first debate I secured as a Member of Parliament was five years ago on Monday, and it was on the future of the Public Health England site at Porton Down in my constituency. I did not imagine then that the first debate I would secure in the 2015 Parliament would also be on the future of that critical site, but I can think of no issue of greater significance to my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/2">Porton Down is known across the world for the work that Public Health England and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory do there. It would not be right to open this debate without first paying tribute to all the staff for the work they have done to tackle Ebola in Sierra Leone in recent months. It has been truly humbling to hear the stories of my constituents, who have travelled at great risk and put themselves on the front line in the fight against Ebola. Their expertise has been vital to the people of Sierra Leone, and it is testament to the UK&#8217;s reputation for excellence in infectious disease research. I welcome the recent decision to award a medal for their commitment and dedication, which I know a number of my constituents will be very pleased to receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/3">It is almost seven years since the Department of Health authorised Public Health England, then the Health Protection Agency, to develop an outline business case for the refurbishment of the facilities at Porton Down. That was after the Science and Technology Committee found the category 4 containment laboratory facilities at Porton Down</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/4">&#8220;to be in need of significant investment given their age&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/5">It recommended in 2008 that</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/6">&#8220;the Department of Health consider the redevelopment of the HPA&#8217;s Porton Down site as a priority&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/7">Project Chrysalis, the proposal for that multi-million pound redevelopment, was put forward shortly after the Committee&#8217;s report was published. In January 2010, a former GlaxoSmithKline site where Public Health England could consolidate its assets in one place was proposed as the preferred option, and a business case was put to the Department of Health just six months later. That was rejected&#8212;rightly, in my opinion&#8212;after scrutiny and further work were commissioned, but not as part of Project Chrysalis. Instead, Public Health England began putting together the case for a single science hub programme, which some might argue was a clear signal of an intention at an early stage to centralise before the business case work had even concluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/8">The new outline business case was finalised in July 2014, and recommended that the facilities at Porton, Whitechapel and Colindale should move to a single campus in Harlow. The PHE board asked for a decision to be made by September 2014. I would like to take the opportunity to ask the Minister why, if the outline business case is so rock solid, it has still not been signed off nine months after Public Health England wanted it to be and 11 months after it was submitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/9">There are certainly doubts remaining among many of my constituents about the decision, for a number of reasons. First, co-location in Harlow was recommended as, according to Public Health England&#8217;s officials, it</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/10">&#8220;offers the best value to the taxpayer and delivers the lowest cost over the 60 year life of the programme&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/11">PHE also stated in its publicly disclosed annexe, however, that</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/12">&#8220;the differences in cost between the options are relatively small&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/13">Professor George Griffin estimated in his review of the single science hub work in 2012 that the difference amounted to 2.6% over 68 years, which I maintain is disputable given the complexities associated with modelling over such a long period. The resultant cost to the taxpayer might well be marginally smaller, but it is important to remember that the costs to my constituents will not be. The fact remains that they are being asked to uproot their lives and transplant to Harlow. For many of them, Salisbury has been their home for years. It is where their children go to school and where their family responsibilities lie.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/14">Increasingly the trend in science is not to co-locate assets on single sites, but to harness the power of technology to work across larger areas. Centralisation remains an approach that the private sector left behind, in many cases a long time ago, in recognition that smaller specialist sites can be more effective. The direction of travel towards greater use of genomics and big data reinforces the argument for smaller entities such as Porton to continue to leverage global partnerships. I was previously told by Public Health England that it favoured the single hub model because of the approach taken at the Francis Crick Institute, but this is not a co-location of one entity&#8217;s assets; six distinctly different players all operate across multiple sites themselves and, in many ways, will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/15">Secondly, the unwillingness to grasp the potential opportunities at Porton or fully to engage in a conversation about them is disappointing. Public Health England says that</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/16">&#8220;the Harlow campus has the potential to become a campus with an international reputation for public health science&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/17">Porton Down already has an international reputation. It has 250 external partnerships across the world and is supported by $55 million of investment from the US Government. It already partners more international universities than universities in the UK, eight US Government agencies, five international health bodies and nine global pharmaceutical companies.&#160;</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/18">Public Health England has not yet articulated publicly precisely how being in Harlow will improve on that. How many new commercial partnerships does it believe will be generated from the site? What will be the impact on Public Health England&#8217;s revenue streams? Have those factors even been modelled thoroughly as part of the business case? I have long been concerned that the outline business case focuses too narrowly on Public Health England&#8217;s objectives as an organisation and the benefits it allegedly accrues from centralisation, not the wider opportunities for UK life science industries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/19">Thirdly, centralising in Harlow flies in the face of the Government&#8217;s agenda to promote more prosperous regional economies. The Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/20">&#8220;The south-west contains some of Britain&#8217;s greatest economic strengths. It should be as central to our nation&#8217;s future prosperity as any other part of these islands&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/21">He said that it</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/22">&#8220;already has a strong reputation for life sciences&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/23">and even asked the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer to</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/24">&#8220;explore the potential for new proposals for investment in life sciences in the south west&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/25">In the light of that ongoing work, will the Minister assure me that the chief scientific adviser has been consulted about the single science hub, given its implications for the entire south-west?</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/26">I appreciate that not all of Public Health England would move to Harlow, should the business case be approved, and that Porton would retain the manufacturing facilities. I also recognise that Public Health England management have given an assurance that they will not be abandoning those remaining facilities, and that they are meeting representatives of Wiltshire Council on Friday to examine how Public Health England can facilitate the optimal exploitation of opportunities that will derive from a new science park, which this Government have supported, right on its doorstep. However, it is unacceptable to assume that that would be appropriate consolation for the loss of the remaining facilities and capabilities, and I remain concerned that, if the Porton site were cannibalised in that manner, the temptation to examine commercial opportunities for those remaining facilities would be high.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/27">Indeed, I understand from a letter that was recently sent by the Under-Secretary of State for Life Sciences, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24817" name="George Freeman">the Member for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman)</phrase>, to an interested party on <phrase class="date" code="2015-06-10">10 June</phrase> that Public Health England is</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/28">&#8220;continuing to investigate commercial opportunities for its activities at Porton&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/29">I have long been an advocate for greater capitalisation on the commercial potential at Porton, but I would like assurances that the vaccine manufacturing facilities will be treated with the respect they deserve and not simply sold off to provide a quick win to allow the Government to balance the equation. This is not just a vaccine factory, and any proposal to maximise its potential needs to recognise its value to the south Wiltshire and regional life science economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/30">More importantly, how do these concurrent agendas best serve the interests of my constituents? Can the Minister reassure me that individual Government Departments are not operating on different agendas? It seems to me that any discussions about commercialisation in advance of a decision on the outline business case would be premature and potentially misaligned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/31">Fourthly, the opportunity to consider the more effective use of existing public sector assets has still not been fully considered. The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, located on the same site, has existing synergies with Public Health England and the two organisations work together closely. DSTL also has category 4 containment facilities which were refurbished relatively recently and are considered to be of the highest standard. Indeed, it has spare capacity in its facilities, and when the size of refurbished labs at the Public Health England site was being discussed, the decision was taken to request a smaller facility on the basis that DSTL would be expected to provide back-up capacity in an emergency. Professor George Griffin also told the Science and Technology Committee in 2008 that</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/32">&#8220;the Ministry of Defence has a facility at Porton&#8230;there is spare capacity there, we know, and we would be able to use that if necessary&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/33">However, I have been told that there are conceivable emergency scenarios in which DSTL and PHE would need to occupy the entire space at the same time, resulting in a conflict of interest with severe implications for national security. Those scenarios have never been articulated&#8212;they may well be considered above my pay grade&#8212;but I would ask the Minister to put on record that the DSTL collaboration option has been fully explored with DSTL management and examined independently, and that the security concerns about the laboratories proved irresolvable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/34">DSTL and PHE have an important collaboration that benefits from their physical proximity. They are treated as the &#8220;Porton campus&#8221; by the regulator, enabling pathogenic samples to be transferred between the two sites without the need for additional licensing. Both are licensed for animal work, and I understand that PHE manages some of the sensitive resources occasionally used by DSTL. They can currently be safely transported at minimal risk, but a move to Harlow would completely remove that capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/35">Fifthly, I again take the opportunity to emphasise that Porton Down is embedded in the Salisbury community. We support its staff and recognise the sensitive nature of the vital work they carry out. Porton&#8217;s relatively isolated location makes it an ideal secure site. Harlow remains untested, and rebuilding the relationship and acceptance of the sensitive work that Public Health England does will take valuable time and effort. As many of my constituents tell me, it is simply common sense to keep that work where it is, not move it to a more densely populated suburban area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/36">Finally, I reiterate that this is not just a conversation about keeping jobs in my constituency; it is a debate about what is best for our life science industry and the partners that depend on Porton&#8217;s expertise. I said in my previous Adjournment debate that my primary concern is that the decision is motivated by a desire to tidy up different entities within the PHE organisation on to a single site, when the advantages of co-location are notional, uncosted and unproven. Until I am permitted to see the full business case, my concerns will remain about the logic that is being used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/37">I appreciate that this is a decision that will have significant implications for our national security and I have always stressed it is imperative that we get it right. However, the Department of Health was informed in 2008 that the category 4 labs at Porton were</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/38">&#8220;built over 50 years ago and refurbishment and upgrading work is becoming increasingly difficult.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/39">In my debate five years ago this week, the then Minister with responsibility for public health, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>, told the House:</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/40">&#8220;The site is 60 years old, the building structures are in a poor state of repair and the laboratories clearly do not meet modern safety standards, so something must be done.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-06-22.273"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 June 2010; Vol. 512, c. 273</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/41">I believed her, yet five years later nothing has been done. The facilities are deteriorating and my constituents have lived in the shadow of this decision for five years, not knowing if they will be moving to Harlow, although we have had the positive news of a science park, which will, I hope, open in the next year or so. I will persist in my questioning on this matter, because, frankly, some of my questions have gone unanswered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1008.2/42">When I last met the PHE leadership team in November, I was told by the most senior official that he was the boss and he would decide how any re-examination of Porton&#8217;s potential would be evaluated, but I have heard nothing from him for six months. I have a responsibility to my constituents to seek assurance that the decisions that will have an impact on their lives are being made on the basis of rigorous analysis of the facts. I urge the Minister to finally clarify for my constituents, one way or the other, where their future lies. We owe the staff based at Porton Down that much.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-06-24a.1012.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24719" speakername="Jane Ellison" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="1012"  time="019:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150624/debtext/150624-0004.htm#150624-0004.htm_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.1012.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24839" name="John Glen">the Member for Salisbury (John Glen)</phrase> on having secured a hat-trick of debates on the future of Porton Down, which is a very important subject not just for his constituents, but for the whole country, given the work done there on a wide range of public health threats, including the Ebola outbreak in west Africa. I join him in paying tribute to his constituents for their service both in the UK and on the frontline in Sierra Leone. The medals are hugely deserved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/2">My hon. Friend has been a tireless campaigner for his constituents on this matter and on the creation of Porton science park, which I will turn to later. Through this campaigning he has shown a passion for growth and job creation in his area, and we all admire that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/3">Scientists have been doing invaluable work at Porton Down since the 1950s. As my hon. Friend has said, in previous debates it has been stressed that the buildings are more than 60 years old and are increasingly becoming unfit for purpose. I know that my hon. Friend agrees with the need to find a solution to the problem&#8212;indeed, he devoted his speech to that&#8212;to ensure that the vital work can continue. It is important that scientists have the benefit of state of the art facilities that reflect the latest technological advancements, including the shift from Petri dish to big data. So much has happened in recent years and so much change is going on. There is a clear consensus that the status quo is not acceptable and that it will not enable Public Health England to deliver the public health scientific expertise that the Government and the nation require.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/4">My hon. Friend ran through the options. He knows that Public Health England has looked at a number of options to meet the challenge it faces. It has had to consider a wide range of longlisted and shortlisted options, all of which have to demonstrate the best value for money to the taxpayer. The main focus of the options has been on the existing Porton Down and Colindale sites, and the former GlaxoSmithKline facility in Harlow, Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/5">As my hon. Friend mentioned, Public Health England has briefed him and the local MPs, local authorities and other key stakeholders, and has consulted the chief medical officer and chief scientific officer, about the three sites affected and considered in the option appraisal. As my hon. Friend will be aware, PHE&#8217;s case is that there are significant benefits from bringing together the range of public health science functions that it manages at disparate sites. I accept that he expressed scepticism about some of the arguments, but PHE believes that creating an integrated national science hub rather than reproviding the same facilities on the same sites would</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/6">be its ideal. For that reason, in the PHE outline business case, the preferred option was to create a public health science hub based at Harlow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/7">My hon. Friend asked what was included in some aspects of the outline business case. I can confirm that no additional revenues from any relocation have been included, in line with the rules and guidelines of what is and can be included in such cost-benefit analyses. However, it is hoped that new facilities will lead to increased academic and commercial income.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/8">As I have said, it is essential that the proposal taken forward offers the best value for money for the taxpayer while protecting the vital heath protection functions carried out by scientists. The scrutiny of the business case has included two external reviews organised by the Major Projects Authority. Both have concluded that the business case properly evaluates the options, including options based at Porton. Since our last debate on this topic last September, the review process has continued and the business case has been through a Major Projects Authority gateway process. I can assure my hon. Friend that that has been and will continue to be a thorough and robust process, and that the outline business case continues to be scrutinised by Ministers at the Department of Health, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/9">As I have said, PHE has considered a wide range of options in the outline business case, including those that would involve remaining at Porton Down. Alternative, third-party proposals have been put forward, including those of the Porton life sciences group, which were kindly forwarded to me and to other Ministers by my hon. Friend. I assure him that the proposals have been carefully considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/10">We recognise the need for collaboration between Public Health England and its neighbours at Porton and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, in the interests of national security. PHE is committed to being collaborative, including having discussions about the use of specialist high-containment facilities. However, we need to be clear that, although PHE and DSTL will continue to collaborate closely, PHE needs dedicated high-containment facilities to ensure that it can properly respond to the threat our nation faces. PHE is the employer of the specialists that are registered to handle human health specimens. The DSTL facilities provide additional resilience, but they were built to meet military requirements. In addition PHE&#8217;s facilities provide resilience to the military if DSTL&#8217;s facilities are for any reason unavailable. Whatever the final decision, national security, and capabilities for national response, are paramount. It is therefore key for DSTL and all other potential agencies involved in the response to work with PHE to protect public health from current and future threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/11">Public Health England has confirmed that it remains committed to the Porton site, even if it is decided to relocate the Porton research functions and staff. That would involve the PHE facilities remaining at Porton consisting of some 300 staff in development and production and regional laboratories. That has continued, with PHE spinning out development and production as a</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/12">corporate company called Porton Biopharma Ltd, which is wholly owned by the Secretary of State for Health. That will allow for Porton Biopharma Ltd to take a commercial approach to growing the business. I note my hon. Friend&#8217;s consistent support for that&#8212;he has not spoken against the idea. That allows more people across the world to benefit from the specialist products it manufactures. PHE has briefed my hon. Friend on that work and on maximising the commercial potential of the production facilities at Porton. As he said in his speech, that principle has his support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/13">The work to increase the commercial potential of the production facilities at Porton will be closely linked to the Porton science park, which I know my hon. Friend has worked hard to bring to his constituency. Porton Biopharma Ltd is next to the new science park and PHE is working closely with Wiltshire County Council on the further opportunities in the life sciences sector that this important development could bring to his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/14">My hon. Friend rightly focused much of his remarks on the need to support staff in the most appropriate way, and on how unsettling it is for any group of staff to not quite know where their future lies. One third of the posts currently at Porton will remain there, even if research functions and staff are relocated. If those functions are relocated, PHE would work with each member of staff at Porton who is working in a post that would move to Harlow under the new proposals, to support them in decisions about their future. He is absolutely right to make that paramount and I take it very seriously. Some staff may want to relocate to Harlow and others may wish to retire or move to other roles outside PHE. The business case includes support packages for staff that are in line with the Government standard. I hope that gives him some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/15">As I have set out, the work conducted at Porton Down is of local, national and international importance. However, there is a consensus that, given the ageing facilities, doing nothing is not an option. PHE has looked at a wide range of possibilities for the future of health protection laboratories in the UK and at the benefits of combining various public heath functions. This has led to a preference for the Harlow site at the outline business case stage. Regardless of the final decision, PHE remains committed to the Porton site, as expressed through the commercialisation of its development and production arm. This will be closely linked to the Porton science park. The outline business case has been through, and continues to go through, rigorous, thorough and robust scrutiny before a final decision is reached by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.0/16">I thank my hon. Friend for his continued keen scrutiny of this important issue. I congratulate him once again on securing the debate and on continuing to be such an ardent champion for the interests of Porton as a science centre of excellence and for his constituents and their future.</p>
