<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-05-28a.228.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10614" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="228"  time="012:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150528/debtext/150528-0002.htm#150528-0002.htm_spnew52">
	<p pid="a.228.0/1">I was delighted to hear the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25404" name="Joanna Cherry">the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry)</phrase>. When I was elected 28 years ago, it was said that too many lawyers were entering the House of Commons. However, I think we should make an exception in her case and in that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25353" name="Keir Starmer">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer)</phrase>&#8212;two very distinguished QCs who are making their maiden speeches today. The hon. and learned Lady will clearly be a star of this Parliament, and we will all want to hear more of what she has to say on these issues. I want to correct the hon. and learned Lady on one point. Edinburgh may be the most beautiful capital city in the world, but she needs to come to see Leicester, which is by far the most beautiful city in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/2">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I want to say to the electors of Leicester East, &#8220;Thank you for sending me back for my seventh term&#8221;. It is good to see the House with so many new faces in it, and I particularly welcome the most diverse House of Commons that we have ever had, with more women and more members of the ethnic minority community than ever before. When my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10001" name="Diane Abbott">the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> and I were elected, there were only four MPs from the black and Asian minority communities; we now have 41, including the first woman of Asian origin ever elected in Scotland, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="unknown" name="None">the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (Ms Ahmed-Sheikh)</phrase>. I was about to say that she is sitting in her usual place, but that is, of course, usually the place of UKIP MPs&#8212;and we are delighted that she has taken it over. There are problems with seating, but we are very pleased to see her there.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/3">This Queen&#8217;s Speech debate has been dominated by Europe and immigration. I agree with much of what <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10241" name="Damian Green">the right hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> said about Europe, but not so much with what he said about immigration. I think the Government need to confront real problems on that issue. They made a start in the last Parliament. In the past, Labour Ministers have said &#8220;mea culpa&#8221; over the broken system that existed under successive Governments, both Labour and Conservative.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/4">I was pleased when the last Government abolished the UK Border Agency&#8212;as a direct result, I should say, of recommendations made in the last Parliament by the Home Affairs Committee, of which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10645" name="David Winnick">the Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick)</phrase> and others were members. The fact is, however, that while we can pass numerous Acts of Parliament in the House of Commons, we will have real problems if the system of enforcement does not work effectively. As I said to the Home Secretary earlier, only 3% of the allegations that are made about illegal migration result in deportation. I echo <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10131" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> in saying that Labour Members will support the Government&#8217;s efforts to deal with illegal migration and abuse by passing new legislation, but we must have an enforcement system that works, and it must go beyond some of the initiatives that we saw five years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/5">I am particularly concerned about what is happening in the Mediterranean. I do not believe that the solution offered by the European Union&#8212;a quota system&#8212;is the answer. To my mind, the answer is to give a huge amount of support to the countries of the Maghreb, because that is where the problem lies. Last year, 92% of the people who entered Italy had come from Libya. Sometimes we have to step back and remember the way in which our foreign policy decisions affect countries, bearing in mind that it results in attempts by refugees and asylum seekers to come to western Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/6">Along with others, including my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall North, I went to Calais to see the large number of people who wished to come and settle in the United Kingdom. Many had paid up to &#8364;7,000 to people-traffickers in order to get to France, and they had one ambition: to come and live in the United Kingdom. It is far too late for us to deal with the situation in Calais. Even passing laws in the House will not deal with the problem; it must be dealt with on an EU basis, and that means that we must work with colleagues to deal with it at source. We must work with the transition countries, but we must also deal with the countries that are most affected by these crises.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/7">In the last Parliament, the Home Secretary initiated a revolution in the landscape of policing. She is still in her job, and we shall be able to see whether that landscape has finally settled down. We hope very much that there will be no more change, because although change is sometimes very attractive, if we mess with the system any more, we shall see a great many disgruntled people operating in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/8">I am saddened to learn that Keith Bristow, whom the Home Secretary appointed to run the National Crime Agency, has just announced that he will stand down next year. A top cop who, when he was given the job, hoped that he would be there for a number of years to bed in the new agency is now going to leave. If policing is to be effective, we shall need to consider such personnel issues, and ensure that we carry the police force with us. I see that the Minister for Policing, Crime and Criminal Justice is present. I am sure that he is in regular contact with all the stakeholders, but they have been through a great deal, and I think that we should now step back and ensure that the system beds in.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/9">As for the question of the European Union, I am one of the Labour Members who feel that it is important to give the British people a choice in an in/out referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/10">I am absolutely clear about how I will vote&#8212;I will vote to stay in the European Union&#8212;but I think that it was wrong for us to say, for years and years, that this House rather than the British people should make the decision. They now have a chance to make that decision, and my party is in favour of the referendum. We will support the Europe Bill that was included in the Gracious Speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/11">However, I think that we should be careful with our use of the word &#8220;reform&#8221;. I know that the Prime Minister is busy this week&#8212;I believe that he will meet Angela Merkel tomorrow, he has already met the Danish Prime Minister, and Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, went to see him last Sunday&#8212;but we need the House to be involved in these decisions. I do not think that we can leave it entirely to the Prime Minister. It is not that I do not trust the Prime Minister&#8212;of course I do: he is the elected Prime Minister of this country&#8212;but I think that the House needs a say in what constitutes the reform agenda. It must be about more than just changing the benefits system; we need a fundamental reform of the way in which the EU performs its business.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/12">To assist that process, I think that we need Members such as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10213" name="Liam Fox">the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10095" name="Bill Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase>, as well as Opposition Members, to contribute their views on how the reform agenda can be developed. If that happens, the British people will see this as a genuine negotiation. The worst possible outcome for the Government would be a belief that the only purpose was to have a referendum, and that the matter would then be settled for a generation. If we take a proper, thorough look at the way in which the institutions operate, the British people will be satisfied that we have done a good job.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/13">I saw no reference in the Queen&#8217;s Speech to our relations with India. I think that the way in which we have developed relations with the second-most populous country on earth has been particularly successful under successive Governments, and I therefore think it important for us to invite the Prime Minister of India, Mr Modi, to visit Britain. I hope that that is on the Government&#8217;s agenda, although it was not in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. The official visits have already been announced&#8212;it is the President of China who is coming&#8212;but I think that we ought to adopt an even-handed approach to China and India, given that they represent two-sixths of humanity.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/14">Finally, let me say something about the national health service. As some Members will know, I suffer from type 2 diabetes. I know that you have a particular interest in the subject as well, Mr Deputy Speaker, for I have attended many meetings with you. Apparently we are going to increase the NHS budget. I want it to increase in support of preventive work on diabetes, given that 700,000 people in the country have diabetes but are entirely unaware of it. They include many members of the south-east Asian community, and many members of other communities. Unless we provide preventive care, the cost to the NHS will be even greater than the 10% of the budget that we are currently spending. We are spending so much money on an area of health policy that we cannot reverse, while we could be helping to prevent those with diabetes from acquiring the most serious strain, and even helping to put off the advent of diabetes for years.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.0/15">Those are some of the issues that I hope the House will be able to debate and develop during the year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-05-28a.264.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364" speakername="Jess Phillips" colnum="264"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150528/debtext/150528-0003.htm#150528-0003.htm_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.264.0/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make my maiden speech. This is the first time I have been called a maiden, and it seems a little unusual as my children watch me from the Strangers Gallery. I assure everybody here that it is good that they are behind the glass&#8212;I can see them talking up there!</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/2">I am exceptionally proud to be one of the new women MPs elected to this Parliament, and to be one of the working parents elected&#8212;we have a lot to offer when deciding what is best for our country, which has not always happened. Like those of my predecessor, John Hemming, my roots in Birmingham, Yardley run deep. I know from reading his maiden speech that this was a source of great pride for him&#8212;and I feel the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/3">A Brummie accent is a rare thing in this Chamber, and I look forward to changing that. Like so many Brummies, my nan and grandad from both my mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s sides moved from Birmingham&#8217;s Peaky Blinders-famed inner city industrial areas in Small Heath, Ladywood and Winson Green to the estates of Yardley and Sheldon that were newly built in the &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s. They were proud of their new homes and raised all their children there.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">My family benefited from decent council houses and good communities, and during my campaign I was proud to knock on the doors of three different houses where my parents had lived&#8212;on Garretts Green Lane, Frodesley Road and Gleneagles Road.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/5">During the campaign, I visited Yardley Great Trust, a charity whose history in the area is even longer than mine. Originating in the 14th century, the Yardley Great Trust has helped to alleviate poverty and support residents in their sickness and old age, and it continues to do so today. In 1966, the Yardley Great Trust gave my mum a grant to help poor local kids stay in education, so that she did not have to leave school to help her single mother with the housekeeping before doing her A-levels. She went on to achieve a great many things and gave me and my brothers a good life and lots of opportunities. Birmingham, Yardley was good to my family, and I plan to repay this debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/6">I requested to make my maiden speech in this section of the Queen&#8217;s Speech debates because, along with all things Birmingham, Yardley, I am deeply committed to improving our country&#8217;s response to victims of domestic and sexual violence and abuse in all its forms. Having worked for years in a service that operated refuges, rape crisis, child sexual exploitation services and human trafficking services, I know that we need to do more. We need look no further than at the poor rape conviction rates to know that for very vulnerable victims our justice system is too often just another establishment that has failed to protect them.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/7">For years before I sat on these Green Benches&#8212;and, I am sure, for many more after&#8212;there will have been calls for Government Departments to work better together to understand the multiple and layered effects that our decisions have on people&#8217;s lives. I can think of no better example than the interaction between the Department for Work and Pensions and our Justice and Home Affairs Departments. I have no doubt that the Home Secretary is committed to ending child sexual exploitation, and it is true to say that her Department has invested in improving services for victims of sexual violence. However, as a Government, it is no good to give with one hand and take away with another. This Government&#8217;s rumoured plans to remove housing benefit from people aged under 21 will be disastrous for these vulnerable victims. While I do not agree with this measure at all, I want to compel the Government to remove from this new legislation vulnerable people in supported accommodation. To make my point, I shall tell the story of Helen.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/8">Helen was an 18-year-old girl I met in my first week in my old job, and she has stayed with me for the last six years. She had been abused by her father as a child, and had been in and out of local authority care throughout her&#8212;so-called&#8212;childhood. Between the ages of 15 and 18, she had been exploited by one &#8220;boyfriend&#8221; or another, all of them much older than her and none with her best interests at heart.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/9">Helen had come to ask for support from our services following her abuse. She was being supported by an independent sexual violence adviser so that she could be helped to give statements to the police, and seek convictions and justice for her childhood abuse. However, following the breakdown of her relationship with her mother and, subsequently, her grandmother, she became homeless, and her life was difficult and chaotic. In the absence of a stable living environment, she again fell victim to those who abused her, and fell out of the justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/10">Eventually&#8212;after cycles of absconding and returning &#8212;we were able to secure supported living for Helen. I remember driving her to what is now my constituency to take her to St Basil&#8217;s, a brilliant youth homelessness charity. With the aid of housing benefit and the home she was given, she was able to learn to look after herself and, with support, seek justice in order to move on with her life and make a future.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/11">Where will Helen go now, in a future that will not give her housing benefit? How many A and E visits will she make during this Parliament? How many custody suites will she block up? How many police reports will be filed for her by a stretched force? Worse still, how many other people will be abused by those who abused Helen while justice is not done? If that is not enough to alarm the justice and home affairs teams who are sitting opposite me, perhaps I should put it differently: how much will this cost their Departments?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/12">In the last Parliament, the domestic violence lobby was able to ensure that victims living in refuges were exempt from universal credit and the benefits cap. Although the Government&#8217;s decision was an afterthought, it was the right decision to keep women and children safe. I urge this Government not to make the same mistake of making the most vulnerable young people an afterthought. I urge them to exempt young people who are at risk of homelessness, and those who are in supported accommodation, from their welfare reform. Last year,</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/13">25% of the victims who lived in Birmingham and Solihull Women&#8217;s Aid refuges alone were aged between 18 and 21. We must protect these victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/14">Justice and security do not end in their defined Government Departments. In my constituency, there are lots of Helens, and it is my job to amplify their stories so that we stop finding it easy to look away. I will never look away. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the chance to tell that story, and I look forward to telling many more.</p>
