It is a simple fact that we are talking about &#163;15 billion for the road investment strategy, which is a greater investment than we have seen in our roads network for a number of years.</p>

In my view, safety could be improved there.</p>

	<p pid="b.404.6/1">The road investment strategy is really important, but we know that every journey begins on a local road and that the vast majority of journeys are made on local roads. Some of them are in quite a state. Last November, to great fanfare, the permanent pothole fund was announced&#8212;we hope that means permanent action on potholes, not permanent potholes. How much has been drawn down by councils from that pothole fund, and how many potholes have been filled in so far?</p>

	<p pid="b.404.7/1">The hon. Gentleman wants devolution, but he also wants the Government to tell local authorities exactly what to do in every set of circumstances. The simple fact is that, for the period 2015 and 2020, &#163;6 billion has been allocated to local authorities for road maintenance. Between 2010 and 2015, the figure was &#163;4 billion. Between 2005 and 2010, the amount allocated to local authorities was &#163;3 billion. That shows the significant increase in the amount that this Government are giving for local road maintenance, and I would have thought that he would welcome that.</p>

	<p pid="b.405.0/1">Will my right hon.

However, in November 2014, the Chancellor announced &#163;300 million for the A47, including the Wansford to Sutton section between the A1 and Peterborough. On the question of noise pollution, the Government have challenged Highways England to mitigate noise at more than 1,000 locations. Measures that could be used include noise reduction surfacing, tree planting and barriers.</p>

According to independent analysis, Scotland is investing twice as much per person in transport as England. That includes active travel projects such as cycling, on which we are already way ahead of the UK. Last year, this Government announced a new &#163;680 million access fund up to 2021.

	<p pid="b.406.3/1">It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman did not mention the high-speed rail line between Edinburgh and Glasgow, which has been conveniently shelved. He may be aware that SNP-controlled Perth and Kinross Council has decided that potholes now have to be at least 60 mm deep&#8212;that is nearly 2 and a half inches&#8212;before it will consider filling them in. That indicates what its priorities might be in some cases.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.4/1">The Minister and I may disagree on many things, but one thing that we do agree on is the benefits of cycling. The cycle-to-work scheme has been a popular and progressive policy, and credit is due to the Government for continuing with it. However, in the summer Budget, the Treasury said that it was actively monitoring salary sacrifice arrangements because they were becoming increasingly popular. In Scotland, progressive policies that work and are popular are something that the Government there support. Will he confirm that he is working to ensure that the Chancellor will protect cycle-to-work schemes in the forthcoming Budget?</p>

	<p pid="b.410.4/1">We are very aware of the importance of bus services to rural communities and, in recognition of that, we were able to protect the bus service operators grant funding as part of the spending review last year.

Through the private sector we have seen vast improvements in our railway service. At the time of privatisation of our railways, there were 750 million people a year using trains; last year there were 1.6 billion and that figure is growing year on year. So I do not have to be convinced about the advantages of a system that has evolved over a number of years, using the private sector. I will consider any other ways in which we can involve the private sector in providing better railway services for our constituents.</p>

The British Airline Pilots Association wants the Government to run tests on what would happen if a drone were sucked into an engine or hit a windscreen, and the Government have had a working group on the matter since 2013. So why is it only this summer that Ministers will say anything? Should we not know by now what tests have already been done, what regulatory and other options are being considered and when Ministers expect any agreed option to be put into practice?</p>

Yesterday, I met representatives of the British Airline Pilots Association, and that was one of the topics that came up. As the Secretary of State said in answer to an earlier question, severe penalties are in place for people who get involved with such activities. There are a number of technologies, such as geo-fencing, which would prevent those aircraft from entering sensitive airspace. We take the matter very seriously, and we are considering the best action to take.</p>

We had exceptional circumstances last summer, with strikes as well as challenges over migrants closing the tunnel. The Operation Stack proposals, which are effectively to create an off-the-highway holding area, represent a significant investment; it is a &#163;250 million project. The closure of the consultation is only a few days away. I have met Highways England and local providers of highways, and we are working on what we can do in the short term.

	<p pid="b.425.3/1">I am afraid that is not a view shared by tenants&#8217; groups, who have been absolutely astonished by this appointment. Let us be clear, this is the appointment of someone who is a director of a company that derives the majority of its income from the very companies the legislation is intended to regulate. By his own admission&#8212;it is on his CV&#8212;he has been engaged by numerous managed and tenanted pubcos on rent review matters. In the past five years he has acted for Enterprise Inns, Marston&#8217;s and Punch Taverns. The very companies he is currently acting for are bullying and coercing tenants into signing away their rights or forfeiting pubs. His company is actively involved in selling off pubs. How can he possibly be trusted to be impartial, given that for 20 years his salary has been dependent on those he must now adjudicate on and potentially impose financial penalties on? There is a clear conflict of interest, which appears to render this process extremely dubious at the very least.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/2">I must ask the Minister for urgent clarification. Did Mr Newby, as a director, declare how much of the income of the company he works for is derived from the companies he will supposedly adjudicate on? Will he be stepping down from his role as director of Fleurets during the four-year period? How can tenants have any confidence in this appointment? Why has a chartered surveyor been appointed, rather than someone from a legal background or an independent arbitrator? How was this process conducted? We do not know who was involved, how many candidates were involved or who made the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/3">This is a very worrying appointment that once again demonstrates either complicity with pubco influence or an utter lack of understanding and knowledge of the issues and the conflicts in the sector. It is in danger of making a laughing stock of the adjudicator&#8217;s role. Tenant groups predict that if this appointment is allowed to stand, the statutory reforms will go the same way as the failed self-regulatory regime. It is a crass, complicit and clueless appointment, and it now needs to be properly scrutinised by the House.</p>

He is an experienced arbitrator, and the great skills he brings to this position do not just include his extensive experience of the pub trade industry; like many professionals, he has the absolute ability to be fair and to arbitrate fairly. The fact that he might be representing somebody does not mean he is in their pay; he can act independently.</p>

	<p pid="b.426.6/1">Yes. Paul Newby&#8217;s primary job, of course, is to implement the pubs code and make sure it is complied with. When people invoke the pubs code, his job will be to act as a fair arbitrator, and I have no doubt that he has all the necessary skills and experience of the pub trade. As I have said, he has experience of representing both pub companies and tenants, so he sees things from both sides; he has all the skills, and his appointment was made with great care and total propriety.</p>

	<p pid="b.426.7/1">The way the Minister announced the appointment yesterday&#8212;as part of the shambolic proceedings on the Enterprise Bill and</p>
	<p pid="b.426.7/2">Sunday trading&#8212;did not exactly inspire confidence. She announced it in an intervention&#8212;of all things&#8212;on Third Reading, after the Secretary of State could have mentioned it in his Third Reading speech. If nobody had mentioned the pubs code on Third Reading, the announcement would not have been made even then.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.7/3">Turning to Paul Newby&#8217;s appointment as the first adjudicator, I certainly look forward to meeting him and to raising the concerns raised by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> and, more importantly, by pub tenants about the relationship between Mr Newby&#8217;s employers and the large pub-owning businesses. I do not think that the tenants will be at all reassured by what the Minister has said. The challenge for Mr Newby will be in ensuring a level playing field between tenants and pubcos. How does she think that he can do that, given the concerns that have been raised by tenants?</p>
	<p pid="b.426.7/4">There is a very real danger that someone who has acted for Punch Taverns, Enterprise Inns and Marston&#8217;s will be seen as continuing to act on their behalf, and the Minister must be aware of this very real concern, as she sits there, chuntering as usual. She will also be aware of concerns among tenant groups that the adjudicator should not be a chartered surveyor. Will she pursue concerns about the attitude of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors about parallel rent assessments?</p>
	<p pid="b.426.7/5">Labour raised concerns about the pubs code in the Lords and in Committee here, so will the Minister raise those concerns with the adjudicator about pubcos offering shorter leases to make it impractical for tenants to take up the market rent only option? Will she ensure an effective date of <phrase class="date" code="2016-06-01">1 June</phrase> for tenants who wish to take up the MRO, rather than allowing a potential delay of six months&#8212;another of the asks of pub tenants?</p>
	<p pid="b.426.7/6">The shambolic approach to the initial consultation on the pubs code undermined pub tenants&#8217; trust, which is back on track after concerns were raised by pub tenants organisations&#8212;</p>

There are many tied tenants in pubs throughout England and Wales, so we must be careful to ensure that groups genuinely represent the voice of all tenants. We must not let a few dominate the debate. It is important to be fair to both sides and to make sure that all the tenant groups are involved; this is why I am a great fan of Campaign for Real Ale, which represents a large section of tenants.</p>

I am hoping that the appointment of Mr Newby will normalise many of these relationships. I hope this will help to avoid what happened in the case of a pub near me, the Chequer Inn in Ash, which has suffered under an overbearing pub company. New tenants are tempted in and the pub runs well, but then prices escalate until they are forced to collapse and close, when we see a planning application for alternative use.

	<p pid="b.431.0/1">I do not think that that falls within his remit. He is there to ensure that anyone who raises a complaint under the pub code will be able to be heard fairly and that the matter can be arbitrated in the right way. The hon. Lady raises an important point, however. We all know the huge importance of our pubs to communities, and it is absolutely the case that they should trade fairly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-10b.433.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761" speakername="Chris Bryant" colnum="433"  time="010:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160310/debtext/160310-0001.htm#160310-0001.htm_spnew166">
	<p pid="b.433.0/1">I am absolutely delighted that the Leader of the House has confirmed the recess dates that I announced three weeks ago&#8212;I am glad that he is catching up. The decision to hold the Queen&#8217;s Speech on <phrase class="date" code="2016-05-18">18 May</phrase> is a profound mistake. Whatever the Government&#8217;s intentions, they will be misconstrued. We have already seen that the Brexit campaign is now so desperate that it is even trying to recruit members of the royal family to its cause. I say, &#8220;Lay off the Queen and think again.&#8221; After all, there is plenty that we could be getting on with.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/2">The Government&#8217;s permanently delayed decision on Heathrow is hurting business. Their long-delayed childhood obesity strategy is hurting children. They promised to change the law to make it easier to put up mobile phone masts in the countryside four years ago. The Prime Minister even mentioned it again yesterday&#8212;great! We have been calling for it for years, but why do they not just publish the electronic communications code tomorrow?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/3">Incidentally, have the Government learned anything from yesterday&#8212;how to count perhaps? The way in which Ministers handled the Enterprise Bill really was a classic case of how not to do it. They were so scared of the bishops that they let the Bill go all the way through the Lords without mentioning Sunday trading, the provisions on which they inserted upstairs in Committee. At one point in Committee, the Ministers forgot to vote, but a generous Chair allowed them a second chance. Then, at the very last instance, they tabled a manuscript amendment to their own amendment. Some people have said that they are being too clever by half, but, to be honest&#8212;to coin a phrase&#8212;I think they are just a little dim.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/4">I gather that there were many blandishments to rebels yesterday. Arms were twisted and the Chief Whip explained the facts of life to recalcitrant Members. Apparently, the Chancellor even tried being charming, but that was so terrifying that one rebel Member&#8217;s hair turned completely grey and she may never regain the power of speech. Still, after all that, the Government lost. Can you hear that sound, Mr Speaker? It is the sound of the slow ebbing out down the beach of the authority of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I offer this advice for free: this House never likes sharp practice, so stop trying to pull a fast one and just do things the proper way.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/5">Incidentally, is it not time that we abandoned English votes for English laws? Last night, we had the hilarious sight of Ministers staring at you, Mr Speaker, in blank amazement when you suspended the House. When <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11333" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> asked the Chairman of Ways and Means, who should know the answer, if he could explain what was going on, Mr Deputy Speaker made it absolutely clear that he had not the foggiest idea what was happening. Looking at the Minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise, it seemed as though there was a desert of vast eternity between her ears. Nobody understands the system. It wastes time and it has not made a difference to a single decision so far. It is not Bills that need certifying; it is the Leader of the House for introducing this muddle. It is time to abandon it.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/6">Incidentally, I note that the Leader of the House is giving a Brexit speech today&#8212;we are all agog. Did he have to get approval for his speech from the Prime Minister, or from the actual leader of the out campaign, the Justice Secretary? Can the Leader of the House guarantee that his special advisers were not involved in briefing the papers on this speech and will not be in attendance when he makes it? The Cabinet Secretary has explicitly instructed that special advisers may not do so during office hours. Is the Leader of the House therefore being forced to make the speech under cover of darkness? He and I do have one thing in common, however. On Tuesday night, the Labour party auctioned off the opportunity to swim with sharks with me&#8212;this is instead of attending a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party&#8212;and I fear that he may be swimming with the fishes after <phrase class="date" code="2016-06-23">23 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/7">The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee has written to Mike Ashley, the chief executive and majority shareholder of Sports Direct, to demand that he gives evidence on his company&#8217;s decidedly shady practices, but he has refused. This is a truly hideous company. In one warehouse, 80% of staff are on zero-hours contracts. Every member of staff is subjected to a 15-minute search at the end of the day, unpaid. The effective hourly rate is way below the minimum wage, so he should of course be appearing before the Select Committee. Will the Leader of the House confirm that the House can deal with recalcitrant executives? If necessary, the Select Committee can order Mr Ashley to appear. If that fails, it can ask the House to force to him to attend and, if necessary, to be arraigned before the Bar of the House. He may be the 22nd-richest man in Britain, but he is running a modern-day sweatshop and the House will get to the truth.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/8">If we are to criticise the working practices of Sports Direct, however, surely we should put our own house in order. Since 2010, the cost of agency staff working in the House&#8217;s catering and hospitality department has quadrupled. Agency staff now represent one in 12 members of staff, which means that the House will be paying substantially more than those employees will be getting, and they will receive no share of the tips. Should we not bring such staff in house and ensure that everyone gets a fair share of the tips?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.0/9">Finally, may I say happy birthday to my father for tomorrow?</p>

	<p pid="b.434.0/1">I am delighted to send many happy returns to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s father. I also want to take a moment to celebrate another important occasion that is a matter of great interest on the Opposition Benches. Tomorrow is the centenary of the birth of Harold Wilson and it is worth this House marking that. Many people have made the case for having a statue of him in this place. There is a lot to be said for that, so I hope that the Speaker&#8217;s Advisory Committee on Works of Art will give it due consideration. It is particularly apposite to celebrate his life at the moment because, 41 years ago, he was the first person to give us a referendum on our membership of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.434.2/1">I hope to be part of a winning side as well. The other thing about Harold Wilson is that he is a former Labour Prime Minister whom the Opposition are still happy to talk about, which is a bit of a rarity in today&#8217;s world.</p>
	<p pid="b.434.2/2">The shadow Leader of the House went on about the Queen&#8217;s Speech, but I do not understand what he is talking about. One moment he talks about a zombie Parliament with nothing to do, but now he complains that we are having a Queen&#8217;s Speech in May containing an important set of measures that will help to reform this country. The Opposition talk about a zombie Parliament, but last Monday we had the Second Reading of the Policing and Crime Bill, which is an important set of measures that will make a difference to policing in this country. Government Members were here debating it, but where were the Labour Members? They barely turned up and the business finished early. We do not have a zombie Parliament; we have a zombie Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.434.2/3">The hon. Gentleman talked about the authority of the Prime Minister seeping away, but I have to say that coming from the Labour party today, with the authority of its leader seeping away, that is frankly unbelievable. We sit at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions each week and look at the faces of Opposition Members as their leader asks questions. The shadow Leader of the House&#8217;s face is a picture; we know what he thinks about his leader. The Opposition are profoundly depressed and miserable, to the extent that today we have the first speech in the next Labour leadership contest.</p>
	<p pid="b.434.2/4">The shadow Leader of the House asked about the speech I am going to be giving today, but what he missed was that I have already given it, so he clearly was not paying that much attention.</p>

	<p pid="b.435.1/1">Surprisingly enough, I am not after his support.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.1/2">As for the EVEL vote and the procedure that the shadow Leader of the House talked about, the Conservatives stood on a manifesto of giving the English a share in the devolution settlement. We took that through the House and it is now in operation. If it is now the Labour party&#8217;s policy to say to English voters, &#8220;We will take away from you your bit of the devolution settlement,&#8221; I look forward to having that debate on the doorsteps and at the ballot box.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.1/3">On the subject of Mike Ashley and the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, of course it should always be the case that if a Committee of the House seeks to bring somebody who is a citizen of this country before it, it should be free to do so. That should happen, unequivocally.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.1/4">On employees in this House, I simply remind the hon. Gentleman that he is a member of the House of Commons Commission. We discuss how we spend money on this House, but I do not remember him bringing that issue to the Commission. I am sure that he will do so and we will be able to consider it.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.1/5">Finally, this weekend is the denouement of the rugby six nations between Wales and England at Twickenham. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be there cheering on his side, and I will be cheering on the English, but I would say, &#8220;May the best team win.&#8221; One thing we can be sure about is that he will not be joining in the singing of &#8220;Delilah&#8221; this weekend, but he has written that, even as a republican, he looks forward</p>
	<p pid="b.435.1/6">&#8220;to a good old blast of &#8216;God Save the Queen&#8217;&#8221;,</p>

We have made enormous progress under this Government and the coalition Government on improving educational standards in our schools. That is essential to the future success of our nation.

	<p pid="b.436.2/2">The big issue of the day is whether Her Majesty the Queen is a Brexiteer or not. I have an elegant solution for how we can try to discover that: we could perhaps dispatch the Prime Minister to the palace to ask her indirectly&#8212;one purr for in, two purrs for out.

	<p pid="b.436.4/1">You are absolutely right, Mr Speaker. We will leave it entirely to Government figures to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.4/2">Yesterday, the Government were defeated and it was the SNP wot won it&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am afraid that we cannot take exclusive credit for that incredible victory&#8212;there were others, of course, and we did have some friends in the Conservative party&#8212;but we SNP Members really enjoyed the wailing and gnashing of Conservative teeth. There was something almost delicious about the way in which the Tories lashed out at the SNP. This Government, having imposed English votes for English laws, criticised our temerity for getting up and supporting Scottish workers. Do the Government believe for a minute that normal rules stand when it comes to issues such as this?</p>
	<p pid="b.436.4/3">The Government have imposed these ridiculous EVEL rules without the agreement or support of any other party in the House. What about those rules, Mr Speaker? No one had a Scooby what was going on yesterday. I asked the Deputy Speaker and he did not know. I do not blame him, Mr Speaker; you would need an advanced degree in madness and impenetrable inconsequentials even to start to understand what is going on with the dog&#8217;s breakfast that is EVEL. The time has come to abandon EVEL and to decide that it does not work. If anything was to happen to the Leader of the House&#8212;some accidental consequence of his support for the leave Europe campaign&#8212;this will be his legacy. What a legacy to leave the House divided on an issue such as EVEL.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.4/4">I support the calls that were made yesterday by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11189" name="Angus Robertson">the Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase>. We should have a debate on the treatment of asylum seekers in this country and especially the evidence that has been uncovered thus far about their treatment. Perhaps we could have a proper look at the use of private services in dealing with asylum seekers.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.4/5">We are also grateful to the Leader of the House for announcing the recess dates and that there will, after all, be a Queen&#8217;s Speech before the European referendum, but once again the recess dates do not cover the Scottish National party conference. We are the third largest party in the House. The recess covers the Liberal conference, but may I have a guarantee from the Leader of the House that <phrase class="date" code="2016-10-14">14 October</phrase> will be a non-sitting day so that the members of the third party in the House can also get to their conference?</p>
	<p pid="b.436.4/6">Once again, all the time that we are having off in the summer does not include the Scottish school holidays. My hon. Friends will not be able to spend the same amount of time with their families as hon. Members from other parts of the United Kingdom. We need to get that fixed for next year, get the SNP conference covered, and for goodness sake try to cover the holidays of every nation of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.437.0/1">First, Mr Speaker, may I thank you for what you said about the Queen and the royal family? That was absolutely appropriate. The one thing it is always appropriate to say in this House is how we much we value our monarch and appreciate the magnificent job that she does for our nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.437.0/2">With regard to events yesterday, the hon. Gentleman said, &#8220;It was the SNP wot won it.&#8221; He knows that I have a high regard for him, but yesterday was one of those occasions when it was clear how far away from political principle the SNP can find itself. SNP Members cannot talk about the importance&#8212;as they always have and did during the EVEL debate&#8212;of standing aside from matters that are England only, but then dive in when it is opportunistic for them to do so. That is a party of opportunism, I am afraid, not a party of principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.437.0/3">I listened again to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s words about EVEL. As he knows, I was in Scotland last week, supporting our fine team campaigning in the Scottish elections. One of our Scottish members said to me, &#8220;That Mr Wishart is very hysterical, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; I had to reassure him and say, &#8220;Look, he is actually a nice guy behind the scenes.&#8221; However, when I hear comments such as those that he made this morning, I understand why some of the people of Scotland get the wrong idea about him.</p>
	<p pid="b.437.0/4">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary takes seriously the issue of asylum seekers. We will always do our best to ensure that people are treated humanely.</p>
	<p pid="b.437.0/5">I clearly owe the hon. Gentleman an apology. I thought that ensuring that he had the opportunity to be here on the first day of the SNP conference was a help to him, rather than a hindrance, because I have never had the sense that he was desperate to get there first. I thought that, as he did this year, he would enjoy being here on the first day of conference. Clearly we will have to look next year at whether we move his conference dates or do things otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="b.437.0/6">Finally, I have some bad news for the hon. Gentleman. He has competition next year on the Eurovision front. As he may know, Members on the Government Benches are also recording some fine music. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25431" name="Andrea Jenkyns">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Andrea Jenkyns)</phrase> looks like being tough competition for him and the rest of MP4 when it comes to next year&#8217;s Eurovision&#8212;may the best man or woman win.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.0/1">It will not have escaped the notice of the Leader of the House that depending on how the business pans out today, particularly how long the Northern Ireland business takes, there is at least a reasonable likelihood that the important debate at the end of the day on the way in which our Acts of Parliament are recorded may be squeezed down to a very short time, or even squeezed out completely. Given the Government&#8217;s support for the motion, which is supported also by 48 of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and historically by you, Mr Speaker, will the Leader of the House find Government time for a substantive debate on the matter, so that we can let the House of Lords know what we think about it?</p>

	<p pid="b.438.1/1">I know how strongly my hon. Friend feels about the matter. The debate has been tabled on a Backbench day. It is appropriate for it to be a matter for the House, not debated in Government time which would otherwise be made available for legislation. As the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee is here today, I am sure that if my hon. Friend is not able to hold his debate today, an early opportunity will be found to bring the matter before the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.3/1">I am grateful to the Leader of the House for the announcement of the future business. With the date of state opening being announced as <phrase class="date" code="2016-05-18">18 May</phrase>, may I remind the right hon. Gentleman that it is a Standing Order of the House that the Backbench Business Committee be awarded 27 days of Chamber time in a parliamentary Session? We are still some way short of that and we are expecting a glut of Backbench business in the five and a half weeks that remain after Easter and before the state opening. I add one personal rider: if we do get Mr Mike Ashley into this place, may we at the same time question him about the terrible running of Newcastle United football club? I do not want to diminish the importance of the employment practices of Sports Direct, but based on the management of Newcastle United, I am afraid I do not expect a very big party in a brewery any time soon.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.4/1">It is tough being a Newcastle supporter at the moment. I wish the hon. Gentleman and his team well for the rest of the season. There is time to escape the relegation zone and no doubt he will be cheering from the stands. I have no doubt that he will seek more time for Backbench business over the next few weeks. I am aware of what the Standing Orders say. I am not sure that we are quite in agreement on the numbers, but we will have a proper discussion about that. I hope he will note that in response to his request, we made protected time available for the debate on Tuesday. Where it is important to do so, we will look at doing that in the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.439.0/1">On Saturday I joined Dartmoor search and rescue team and learned that 70% of calls to the service come from within the boundaries of Plymouth, many in Home Park, owing to elderly people getting lost. May we have a debate on how we might support those excellent volunteers, who get no money from central Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.439.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. I have suggested before at one of these sessions that the Backbench Business Committee might consider holding a full day debate, when one is available, on volunteering. A large number of Members would like to pay tribute to the good work done in their constituency. That would provide an opportunity for my hon. Friend to do what he has just described. I cannot resist drawing attention to the news story this week that a council in East Anglia has appointed the first hedgehog tsar. It is clear already that my hon. Friend&#8217;s campaign is making a difference.</p>

	<p pid="b.439.2/1">Last week I was visited by retailers from Dewsbury town centre. They are facing unaffordable business rates in the coming year, due to the end of the business rates retail relief. May we have a debate in Government time to discuss whether the Government have plans to subsidise these retailers, many of whom would have to close their businesses as a result of the rises?</p>

	<p pid="b.439.3/1">Of course, we are all concerned about the future of the high street. This is a matter that can certainly be brought up during the debate on the Budget next week. I do not yet know whether the Chancellor has any plans in that area, but the hon. Lady will want to make the case for her constituency in the four days of debate that follow the Budget, when this is very much one of the matters on the agenda.</p>

I know that the project has been supported across the House and I am very grateful for that. May we have time in this place to discuss it? It is massively important because 12% of my district council area was under water in 2011. The history and the lessons we are learning in the south and the north of the UK need to be reiterated.

	<p pid="b.440.0/1">When can we discuss early-day motion 1182?</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/2" class="italic">[That this House believes that politicisation of the institution of monarchy threatens that institution&#8217;s future; recalls that the present monarch remained politically neutral for 62 years until an intervention on the Scottish Referendum debate that The Guardian reported was crafted and choreographed by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, and Sir Christopher Geidt, the Queen&#8217;s Private Secretary; notes that a recent speech by the Prince of Wales was widely interpreted as a plea for the UK to remain in the EU; emphasises that the prime role of the Head of State is to intervene when a Prime Minister acts in her or his own interests to the detriment of the interests of state; and further believes that the Government and the Civil Service should cease employing members of the Royal Family for political purposes.]</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/3">The early-day motion does not trespass into the forbidden area&#8212;that the views of the monarch cannot be discussed in this place, and only in this place, although they can be discussed everywhere else&#8212;but it does raise the conduct of a well-documented conspiracy between Sir Jeremy Heywood and Sir Christopher Geidt at the time when the Scottish referendum appeared to be in trouble from the Government&#8217;s point of view, and it is alleged that those two gentlemen conspired to put the Queen&#8217;s opinion into the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/4">Is not it important that we discuss those who give advice to the royal family, because its main function is to act in situations where a Prime Minister is acting in her or his own interests against the interests of the country? The politicisation of the monarchy would mean that it could not act in those situations, and any exposure of the royal family&#8217;s views threatens the furtherance and continuation of the institution.</p>

That game was originally meant to be played on Saturday and fans were given only 17 days&#8217; notice of the change.

	<p pid="b.450.3/2">Will the Leader of the House make a statement outlining why his title is not a complete misnomer? The Enterprise Bill was farcical from almost start to finish. On Second Reading, the House was asked to vote on amendments that had not been seen. The Government took an assumed view on the SNP position, which we now know was wrong. A late manuscript amendment was tabled but not taken. Then the Government Minister pleaded with the House to vote with him, because he was not going to implement what was in the Bill. As I say, it was a farce from start to finish. May we have a statement outlining when leadership was shown by the Leader of the House and the Government?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-10b.452.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24766" speakername="Nicholas Boles" speakeroffice="The Minister for Skills"  colnum="452"  time="011:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160310/debtext/160310-0002.htm#160310-0002.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.452.1/1">With permission Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about apprenticeships. As you know, Mr Speaker, I am evangelical about apprenticeships. We do not always agree with each other on every question, but I know that to a woman and to a man, all my right hon. and hon. Friends share this passion.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/2">We believe in apprenticeships, because they are one of most powerful motors of social mobility and productivity growth. An apprenticeship represents opportunity, aspiration, ambition&#8212;things that we Conservatives cherish. Apprenticeships make our companies more competitive. Some 70% of employers report that apprentices help to improve the quality of their product or service. They offer people a ladder to climb, with both higher pay and a sense of personal fulfilment at the end of it. A level 2 apprenticeship raises people&#8217;s incomes by an average of 11% three to five years later. A level 3 apprenticeship delivers a 16% boost.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/3">Apprenticeships improve the diversity of the workplace: 53% of the people starting an apprenticeship in 2014-15 were women; 10.6% were from a black or other minority ethnic background, up from 8% in 2009-10; and 8.8% had a disability or learning difficulty. An apprenticeship can take you anywhere. Sir Alex Ferguson did one. So did Jamie Oliver. And Karen Millen. And Sir Ian McKellen. So, too, did the chairmen of great businesses such as Crossrail, WS Atkins and Fujitsu.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/4">The Government have great ambitions for our apprenticeships programme. In the previous Parliament, 2.4 million people started an apprenticeship; by 2020, we want a further 3 million to have that opportunity. We do not just want to see more apprenticeships; we want better apprenticeships in more sectors, covering more roles. The first thing we need to do is persuade more employers to offer apprenticeships. At the moment, only about 15% of employers in England do. In Germany, the figure is 24% and in Australia 30%.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/5">We are therefore introducing a new apprenticeship levy that will be paid by all larger employers&#8212;those with an annual payroll bill of &#163;3 million or more. This will help us to increase our spending on apprenticeships in England from &#163;1.5 billion last year to &#163;2.5 billion in 2019-20. Employers who pay the levy will see the money they have paid for English apprenticeships appear in their digital account. They will be able to spend it on apprenticeship training&#8212;but only on apprenticeship training&#8212;and as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has emphasised, employers will be able to get out more than they put in.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/6">We are also making sure the public sector pulls its weight and follows the fantastic example of our armed forces, which, between them, employ 20,000 apprentices at any one time. We plan to introduce a new target for public sector organisations employing over 250 people in England. They will be expected to ensure that at least 2.3% of their staff are apprentices. We are using the Government&#8217;s power as a customer too. Procurement rules now stipulate that bidders for central Government contracts worth more than &#163;10 million and lasting over 12 months must demonstrate their commitment to apprentices.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/7">We are not only committed to greater quantity; we want to see better quality too. We have already stopped the short-term, low-quality, programme-led apprenticeships developed by the last Labour Government. They made a mockery of the concept and tarnished the brand. We are now asking groups of employers to develop new apprenticeship standards that will help them fill the skills needs created by new jobs and new industries. Some 1,300 employers are involved in this process, and we have published 210 new standards so far. A further 150 are in development. We are also establishing a new employer-led institute for apprenticeships to approve these new standards and ensure that quality is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.1/8">Sixty of these new standards are higher and degree apprenticeships. We want everyone making a choice about their next steps after the age of 16 or 18 to know that the decision to do an apprenticeship is not a decision to cap their ambition or turn down the chance of a degree. It is simply a decision to progress in a different way&#8212;to learn while they earn and to take a bit more time, to bring home a wage and avoid large student loans. Next week is National Apprenticeship Week. I hope that the House of Commons will today speak with one voice. Apprenticeships are for everyone and can take you anywhere. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.453.0/1">I thank the Minister for limited advance sight of the statement. I suppose we should all be grateful, after the turmoil of yesterday, that it did not just turn up in manuscript.</p>
	<p pid="b.453.0/2">What has turned up&#8212;if I can put it this way&#8212;is a dance of the seven veils. The Minister&#8217;s statement is simply a rehash of much of what was already said in the &#8220;English Apprenticeships&#8221; document. That is what concerns the sector: fine words butter no parsnips. The procurement rules he mentions are a pale shadow of what Labour proposed in its 2010 manifesto. Most crucially, there is no further clarity for universities, other areas and large employers about what their responsibilities will be. They want to know whether the levy will be extra money or a substitute for Government funding. Will it be extra resources or simply an Osborne payroll tax?</p>
	<p pid="b.453.0/3">Will the Minister confirm how much he expects the levy to raise, and whether it will be more or less than the &#163;1 billion he said he hoped to add to spending on apprenticeships in England? The Department was supposed to respond to the consultation on the targets for apprenticeships in public sector bodies by <phrase class="date" code="2016-03-04">4 March</phrase>. Has it done so? When will he do so? There is confusion and concern among local government and others about who will be affected. Will he spell out in far greater detail how small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit from the process, and what does he have to say to the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which worries that smaller businesses will be unable to use their full &#163;15,000 allowance?</p>
	<p pid="b.453.0/4">The Minister has told us that he is evangelical about apprenticeships, but Members and the business sector want to know whether he will be too catholic in the definition. Perhaps he should avoid tarnishing his own brand by cheap politicking about the Labour Government, who set up both National Apprenticeship Week and the National Apprenticeship Service, and stop sounding like some old Soviet five-year planner on his tractor targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.453.0/5">With concerns about the quality of these apprenticeships, will the Minister tell us who will supervise the operation of the apprenticeships levy? Will it be the Apprenticeships Delivery Board or the board of the institute for apprenticeships? What has he to say to the Chair of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11362" name="Iain Wright">the Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright)</phrase>, who, I am told, said this morning, &#8220;No one knows what the apprenticeship levy is going to look like. It&#8217;s coming in in a vacuum of darkness, and I am concerned that it&#8217;s just a numbers game.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.453.0/6">What will the Minister tell the Public Accounts Committee, which is so concerned about the direction of his Department that it has recalled the Secretary of State and the permanent secretary for a second grilling before Easter? Finally, perhaps he would like to tell us how he expects to deliver the 3 million target and implement the levy over a very short period with the number of Skills Funding Agency staffing down by 40% since 2011, more cuts to come and an accelerated decline in the number of people in the National Apprenticeship Service?</p>

	<p pid="b.454.0/1">It is amusing to be accused in a relatively short statement from the hon. Gentleman of being a Catholic, a Soviet planner and a dancer with seven veils. I will want to put that in my epitaph.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.0/2">I will try to answer the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s questions. First, to be clear, in the last year of the last Labour Government, public spending on apprenticeship training was &#163;1 billion. It is now &#163;1.5 billion. By the end of this Parliament, it will be &#163;2.5 billion in England. That is extra money in anyone&#8217;s book. Not a single education budget or, indeed, other public service budget is increasing as fast.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.0/3">The apprenticeship levy will raise &#163;3 billion in 2019-20, and &#163;500 million will be needed to make adequate and fair contributions to the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to fund, I hope, their apprenticeship programmes, but that is, of course, for them to judge. All the remaining &#163;2.5 billion will be spent on English apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asks how small and medium-sized businesses, which will not pay the levy, will nevertheless benefit from Government funding for apprenticeships. We expect them to carry on receiving Government money for apprenticeships in the same way as they do now. We do not expect all companies that pay the levy to use up all the money in their digital accounts, and there will be a great deal more money to go around, so we are absolutely determined that the level of apprenticeships provided by SMEs will continue as now.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.0/5">The operation of the levy as a tax is obviously in the hands of Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. The operation of the digital system used to give employers control of the apprenticeship levy that they have contributed will be the Skills Funding Agency&#8217;s responsibility. The institute for apprenticeships will, as I have described, have complete responsibility for overseeing standards and quality control.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.0/6">The hon. Gentleman and, indeed, the Chair of the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee&#8212;I look forward to hearing from him, no doubt&#8212;would like answers to many more questions. They will have to wait just a little. The Chancellor will make his Budget statement next week, after which more technical details will be provided, so that everyone knows well in advance how the levy will work.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.0/1">I welcome the Minister&#8217;s statement today. Since the election, more than 4,000 apprenticeships have been created in my constituency, Aldridge-Brownhills. Will the Minister join me, particularly in the run-up to National Apprenticeship Week, in thanking all the businesses, organisations and our local colleges that have helped to deliver those apprenticeships? Will he assure me that we will continue to ensure that the public sector plays a greater role in giving new opportunities to young people and women?</p>

	<p pid="b.455.1/1">It is excellent news to hear how many apprenticeships have been created in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency. She is right that the public sector to date has not been pulling its weight&#8212;its proportion of apprentices is not the same as that among employees as a whole&#8212;so we will impose the target on larger public sector employers. Public sector organisations will discover what private sector ones know: apprentices help them to do a better job.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.2/1">I thank the Minister for an advance copy of his statement. I am a little surprised at the timing, given that apprenticeship week in Scotland was last week rather than next week, so it would have been beneficial for us to have the statement then. The Scottish Government have recognised the importance of apprenticeships for some time. Indeed, the Scottish Government are committed to creating 25,000 modern apprenticeships a year, which encompasses 80 different types of modern apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.2/2">With that in mind, I would be interested to hear what consultation has taken place with the Scottish Government on this important issue. I do not doubt the Minister&#8217;s good intentions to create apprenticeships&#8212;we should all welcome that&#8212;but I question the method used to raise the money and its sustainability. The introduction of an apprenticeship levy remains a matter of fundamental concern for us. It encroaches on our devolved responsibilities and is causing concern for employers; it has also come under criticism from a wide number of organisations, including the CBI and the Chartered Institute of Taxation. The levy will have a knock-on effect for apprenticeships in Scotland, so we call on the UK Government to consider the economic impact that this measure will have.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.2/3">I would like the Minister to reflect on the fact that Police Scotland will have to pay out up to &#163;4.5 million a year on the UK Government&#8217;s plans for an apprenticeship levy, prompting warnings that finding extra cash savings will be &#8220;virtually impossible&#8221;. The UK Government have still to provide clarity on how Scotland&#8217;s share of the levy raised will be calculated and transferred to the Scottish Government. When will we get that clarity from the UK Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.456.0/1">It is, of course, great news to hear about the Scottish Government&#8217;s commitment to apprenticeships. Because they will now receive substantial extra revenue from their share of the revenue raised by the apprenticeship levy, I hope they will be able increase from 25,000 apprenticeships a year to a rate that is more equivalent to the one that we have an ambition for in England. The hon. Gentleman mentions the problems faced by Police Scotland. On the whole, it would be fair to say that the level of the apprenticeship levy is not the greatest problem facing Police Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.456.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for agreeing to come down to Weymouth shortly to open our third apprenticeship fair at Weymouth College. The new principal, Nigel Evans, has just been appointed, and I greatly look forward to seeing him. May I add one slight note of caution? As a Conservative, I do not like levies&#8212;instinctively&#8212;so let us call it a tax. Has the Minister had any response from big business about its fears for the future if, heaven forbid, a socialist Government ever took over, because this could be an area of taxation that they might want to increase for other reasons?</p>

	<p pid="b.456.2/1">Any excuse to go to Weymouth&#8212;and I am your man, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for inviting me. Like him, I feel an innate scepticism about a new levy on business, but if we talk to large businesses, particularly the ones that are investing in apprenticeships, we find that they say that some of their competitors do not, which restrains the overall level of investment in apprenticeships, because some are taking a free ride on the rest. We are introducing this levy to ensure that all large employers are making this investment, but we are giving them control of the money, so that they can spend it on the apprenticeships that benefit them. If we have to have a new levy&#8212;I agree that we should do so only as a last resort&#8212;it is best to have one that employers control and from which they can benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.456.3/1">It is always nice to see the Minister and it is always welcome to discuss apprenticeships in this place. The Enterprise Bill mentions the public sector apprenticeship targets. Given that we discussed that Bill both yesterday and the day before, why was not the public sector apprenticeship target mentioned then? Will there be a need for new legislation? The statement referred to the need to persuade more employers to offer apprenticeships, and the levy will be the means by which this happens. Will the Minister provide more information&#8212;any information&#8212;about the 98% of employers who will not pay the levy? In a previous response, he seemed to suggest that nothing would change or that large employers would somehow benevolently give away this levy receipt. Clarity is crucial for the success of the 3 million apprenticeship target. Will he provide more clarity, and if not, what is the point of his statement?</p>

	<p pid="b.456.4/1">First, I am grateful to the hon.

It was not the case that we were due to respond to the consultation on the public sector target by <phrase class="date" code="2016-03-04">4 March</phrase>; rather, it was that the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2016-03-04">4 March</phrase>.

This will also enable training providers to continue to take responsibility for ensuring that the training they have promised to deliver is in fact delivered.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.2/1">As the Member responsible for the Apprenticeships and Skills (Public Procurement Contracts) Bill in 2013, let me welcome the Government&#8217;s conversion to using the benefits of public procurement to secure additional apprenticeships. I note that it was Conservative Back-Bench Members who talked out my Bill when it was going through the House of Commons. The Minister said in his statement that the public procurement rules now stipulate that bidders for Government contracts must demonstrate their &#8220;commitment to apprenticeships&#8221;. Precisely what does that mean?</p>

Sometimes Government Members take a while to be persuaded of the merits of an intervention, but once persuaded, we are absolutely determined to fulfil it. The hon. Gentleman is right to ask about the mechanics. We have been advised&#8212;not least by Terry Morgan, the chairman of Crossrail, who led the way by instituting a similar sort of expectation for all subcontractors to Crossrail&#8212; that given the variety of public procurement such as infrastructure projects and services, it was dangerous to impose a single mechanism of either a number of apprentices per &#163;1 million-worth of spend or a percentage of employers on a project. We thus decided to mix and match to make the right requirement depending on what the procurement process is. We will be transparent about how we are going to achieve that.</p>

That rather undermined the quality and the brand of the programme, but we have got rid of those apprenticeships. We have now introduced some simple minimum standards. An apprenticeship must be a job: the apprentice must have an employer. It must last for at least 12 months, and it must have at least 20% off-the-job training content. That is why in some categories we had a short-term dip in the number of apprenticeship starts at the beginning of the last Parliament: we were getting rid of some of the slightly Mickey Mouse apprenticeships that had been on offer.</p>

She is right to say that there are currently too few higher and degree apprenticeships; we would like to see many more of them. We are making reasonably good progress, however. There were 19,800 starts on higher apprenticeships in 2014-15, which was 115% up on the previous year. Degree apprenticeships are a relatively new concept, but we are making progress and more than 1,000 people have now started such apprenticeships. We have much further to go, and there will always be more level 2 and 3 apprenticeships, but we want everyone who is doing those apprenticeships to be able to look up and see the higher and degree apprenticeships that they could move on to.

Will he confirm that the employers involved are from a broad range of sectors so that everyone&#8217;s requirements are met?</p>

	<p pid="b.462.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right about this. It is extremely important not only that employers are in charge of developing standards to ensure that those standards are directly relevant to current occupations, but that we do not involve just the large employers that have human resources departments and senior managers who can go to meetings to help to develop those standards. Before every standard is approved, we insist that small and medium-sized employers in the industry support it.</p>

We want to place no cap on the number of people who decide to go down that route, but we also want another route for those people who find that they learn better by combining study and work, who want to earn a wage and who do not want that full-time university experience. This is about not telling people what to do, but offering them a choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.463.6/1">I, too, welcome the great progress that has been made on apprenticeships to date and the overall positive tone from across the parties in support of them.

	<p pid="b.463.7/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question, not least because I have been working with him and others on the possibility of establishing a pilot. Our minimum requirement that an apprenticeship has to last 12 months poses problems for very seasonal businesses, which will employ people for perhaps six or nine months, but not a continuous 12-month period. With the tourism industry, in which he is particularly interested, we are looking at establishing a pilot whereby an apprentice may be employed for 12 months out of a 15-month period. Hopefully, such an approach would encourage more apprenticeships in that and other sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.464.0/1">When the contracts were agreed for the &#163;97 million Titanic signature project in east Belfast 10 years ago, social contracts and clauses for apprenticeships were novel&#8212;and welcome&#8212;but it quickly became increasingly clear that while the developer was happy to satisfy the required number of apprentices, it did nothing to sustain them. When apprentices became less inclined to remain in their apprenticeships or fell away, their numbers were not refilled, so the end result was that the apprenticeships were not completed as promised. How will the Minister ensure that, although an apprenticeship must last 12 months, those who enter the system go through and complete the process?</p>

	<p pid="b.464.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises an important concern. The truth is that most industries are telling us that they have a huge skills need, so unless an employer loses a big contract or does not find a new contract to replace another that comes to an end, it is relatively unlikely that they would want to lose an apprentice in whom they had invested quite a lot of training. Most apprentices do not reach their maximum productivity until after they complete their apprenticeship. I am hopeful that employers, and particularly those that are paying the levy every year, will want to create apprenticeships and invest in them, because they will want to use these skills for the long term.</p>

	<p pid="b.466.6/2">Murders have happened both recently and in the distant past. We have heard about loyalist paramilitary activity and killings, and <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase> has made many representations about the disappearance of Lisa Dorrian, which has clearly had a major impact not only on her family, but on the community. We have also seen IRA murders in recent times&#8212;Robert McCartney, Denis Donaldson, Paul Quinn and more recently Kevin McGuigan in Belfast. What strikes me is the brutality and the clinical way in which those murders were carried out&#8212;the hallmark of the IRA in the past. The murders were not carried out by amateurs; they were carried out by professional terrorists and remind us of the IRA and other terrorist organisations. We want to bring an end to that. We must not forget that the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland said recently that the IRA and the army council still exist. We need to deal with that and to ask whether the IRA and the army council are still inextricably linked to Sinn F&#233;in, which is in government in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.6/3">Amendment 1 relates to the appointment of two members to the independent reporting commission by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I accept that the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; document states that the Executive will appoint those two members, but we are seeking a move away from political appointments because it would be helpful if the appointments were made by a more independent body. When Northern Ireland parties were progressing aspects of the Stormont House proposals last year, it was suggested that the appointment of the proposed historical investigations unit director would also be done by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. During the many discussions on that process, there was some level of agreement that there could be other, better ways of making that appointment. The Ulster Unionist party put forward suggestions for an independent process, but given others&#8217; concerns about that, the option of the director being appointed by the Northern Ireland Policing Board carried some weight among all the parties involved in the talks.</p>

	<p pid="b.467.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady for that helpful intervention. We discussed the matter at length during the talks last year, into which all parties had input, including officials from the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice. We felt that the Policing Board could be such a mechanism. I suppose that, in fairness, some people might say that it is still semi-political, and it is, but it has independent members so it can cross the political divide towards independents and lay people. That is why we felt that it was a good option for making appointments in this process, particularly given the fact that the Deputy First Minister has, by his own admission, said in the past that he was a senior member of the Provisional IRA. Obviously, there is still a question mark over whether he is still a member of the IRA army council.</p>

	<p pid="b.467.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, and I agree with the first aspect of it. Yes, there are members of Sinn F&#233;in and members who were former terrorists on the Policing Board, but the difference is that it is an organisation with a much broader base. There are independents, and it is likely that there will be only one member of Sinn F&#233;in on an appointment panel with seven, eight or even nine lay members. Obviously, as things stand, there would be just the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. There is a significant difference, I think, but I take the point.</p>

	<p pid="b.468.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman also accept that when the decision rests with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister there is a power of veto by one of the Ministers, which would not be the case if members were appointed by the Policing Board?</p>

	<p pid="b.468.1/1">I have not seen the option of veto exercised to a great degree with other appointments, so I would have concerns about whether that would work in this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.1/2">By and large, there was a degree of support for the historical investigations unit director possibly being appointed by the Policing Board, but if that appointment was to be made by another independent body, we would be quite happy to consider that. In fact, the Ulster Unionist party initially proposed that the decision should be made by an independent body, not the Policing Board. The proposal to use the Policing Board came from another political party and we said as a compromise that that could be an option, which seemed to engender support.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.1/3">That is our view. I should have thought that it would have received broad support, but perhaps that is wrong. In general, I think it is important that we try to move away from that political appointment process into a more independent one, because clearly we are dealing with very sensitive issues and material, so it is important that we have people of the right ability and calibre. The Policing Board has a track record, I know, and although I take the point made by the hon. Member for South Antrim about members of Sinn F&#233;in being on the Policing Board, it has appointed the past three Chief Constables, the past three Deputy Chief Constables and a significant number of Assistant Chief Constables. Clearly, the board has done a lot of work on the appointment process for significant police officers and high-profile police officers, so I would argue that as they are well-versed in making such appointments the process might have been better and more independent if they made the decision rather than just the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</p>

	<p pid="b.468.2/1">We are unable to support the proposition behind amendment 1. We are not against the concept of moving towards greater independence for such appointments, but in the context of getting a political agreement that was not possible, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase> rightly acknowledged. The Stormont agreement therefore gives the responsibility for making the appointment to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said and would echo the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11374" name="Sammy Wilson">the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase>&#8212;East Antrim, not South. We have not yet redrawn the boundaries in Northern Ireland, although we are going to.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.2/2">We have two difficulties with the proposal to use the Policing Board. May I say that having served on the Policing Board, I fully support it as an institution. It does a good job on the whole question of accountability in policing. Our objection is not on the basis that the Policing Board is somehow deficient, but the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone revealed his true objective and motivation when he talked about the suitability of the Deputy First Minister to be involved in this appointment because of his alleged past in the IRA.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.2/3">I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but the difficulty I have is twofold. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim rightly pointed out, we have three Sinn F&#233;in members on the Northern Ireland Policing Board: Gerry Kelly, Pat Sheehan and Caitr&#237;ona Ruane. At least two of those members have past convictions for IRA terrorism, so passing responsibility to the Policing Board does not resolve the difficulty the hon. Gentleman refers to, in terms of victims and survivors of the conflict in Northern Ireland having a problem with anyone from Sinn F&#233;in being involved in the appointments process&#8212;a concern I have much sympathy with.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.2/4">I depart from the hon. Gentleman on the second point made by my hon. Friend, on the question of the veto. The current arrangement that gives us a veto in the office of the First Minister over who is appointed is surely a far stronger safeguard to ensure that the people who are appointed to this very sensitive role are people that the victims and survivors community can have confidence in. If we go to the Policing Board, there is no such veto. Indeed, the political influence on the Policing Board is outweighed by the independent influence. I emphasise that I have nothing against the current structure of the Policing Board; I am merely making the point that if you want to exercise a degree of accountability on this issue and ensure that the people who are appointed to this very sensitive role are appropriate for that role, having a veto gives you the leverage to ensure that that happens, whereas if you pass it to the Policing Board you lose that veto.</p>
	<p pid="b.468.2/5">For those reasons, we will not be able to support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.469.0/1">I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby. I rise to speak in support of amendment 7.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/2">On Second Reading, I said that we must cast our minds back to the reasons for the independent reporting commission. This all emerged in the violence and terrorism of last year when two people lost their lives: Gerard Davison at the beginning of May, in the Lower Ormeau and Markets area of south Belfast; and Kevin McGuigan, somewhere in that same location. As a result of those deaths and the breakdown of relationships around the Executive table, we had negotiations on the Stormont House agreement. During those negotiations, the SDLP circulated papers to the three Governments and all parties on a whole enforcement approach, and a whole community approach. We believe that the answers and the solution must come not only from Government and from political parties but from the wider community. There must be a buy-in to a solution, to the eradication of terrorism, violence and antisocial behaviour and to an upholding of democratic principles. We also believe that, although &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; was designed and managed to be a two-party deal, there should have been all-party work on the membership of the independent reporting commission. How can the work of that commission and its mandate, which includes the Irish Government and Dublin representatives, be reconciled with that approach by Sinn Fein?</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/3">During the Second Reading debate, I asked the Secretary of State to state precisely what new moneys would be made available to the National Crime Agency and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, when those moneys would be released and what the split between the two would be. That set some of the background for our amendment. Like the Ulster Unionist party, we feel that the credibility of the independent reporting commission would be enhanced if it involved the Executive more widely rather than just the First and Deputy First Ministers. We believe that it is not a Policing Board matter, which is why we have specified that the two members will be appointed by the Justice Minister in consultation with the First and Deputy First Ministers, subject to Executive approval, hence providing the transparency and accountability that are required in this particularly vexatious issue. All of us on these Benches are agreed on one point. We want to see an end to violence, paramilitarism and terrorism. Above all, we want to see the upholding of democratic principles of government and in the wider civic community.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/4">I support our amendment 7 in this group.</p>

	<p pid="b.470.0/2">At the original Stormont House talks in late 2014, the SDLP proposed that the agenda should include paramilitarism and organised crime. It did not take the murders that subsequently happened to tell us that that was still a serious issue that should not be ignored in any serious negotiations. Unfortunately, we were not supported by other parties, who seemed to believe that that would somehow not be a problem. So we are now addressing an issue that other parties chose to ignore. Whenever the murders happened last year, a political crisis was created over issues that parties chose to ignore and then dramatically tried to advertise.</p>

	<p pid="b.470.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will forgive us if we take his comments as tongue in cheek, given that we were told after the Good Friday agreement in 1998 that these problems were all being dealt with, and the agreement was a comprehensive approach to resolving the issues relating to our conflict in Northern Ireland. We are still dealing with them 18 years later so he should not point the finger at those of us who warned in 1998 that the agreement was deficient in that regard.</p>

	<p pid="b.470.2/1">Without getting drawn too far away from the subject of the Bill, none of us pretended that the 1998 agreement would absolutely solve the problems or dissolve any of the paramilitary organisations. We committed to a framework for decommissioning and a number of other changes. We consistently supported the existence of the Independent Monitoring Commission to deal with the questions of ongoing paramilitary activity. In this House, whenever the previous Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10473" name="Owen Paterson">the right hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson)</phrase>, announced that the IMC was being wound up, some of us said, &#8220;You are taking away the monitoring commission because Sinn Fein has made a political issue of it, but the issue of paramilitarism has not gone away, and it will come back.&#8221; We pointed out that something like the IMC would end up being needed. That is exactly what happened last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.2/2">Some of us have been consistent about recognising where there are problems and that they need to continue to be addressed. We were right about the questions arising when the IMC was wound up with no procedure to deal with ongoing concerns. We were right to say that the issue needed to be addressed in the Stormont House agreement. We were right in the proposals that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down has described when we said that we needed an enforcement approach and a whole community approach to secure an end to paramilitarism, as well as all the other changes that were needed to achieve a wholesome society. We were the only parties that advocated such proposals. To an extent, some of the sentiment of that is reflected in the agreement, but in a highly edited, partial and incomplete way, and that is why we have tabled our amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.2/3">We used to have an Independent Monitoring Commission that reported. Now we have an independent reporting commission. The legislation does not seem able to say &#8220;monitor&#8221;. The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement refers to the term &#8220;monitoring&#8221;, but for some reason &#8220;monitoring&#8221; is not in the Bill. It is as though the legislation has carefully to avoid saying anything that the commission will actually do. So we have to look at the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement to see what the commission might actually do. For some reason, it is avoided in the lengthy clauses of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> said that under the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement the appointments, as well as the one appointment by the British Government and the one by the Irish Government, were to be made by the First and Deputy First Ministers. They were not. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase> is correct. The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement said that the Executive shall nominate two members. Therefore, our amendment is consistent with what is in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. It says that the appointment should be made, rather than by the First and Deputy First Minister, by the Justice Minister after consultation with the First and Deputy First Minister and in agreement with the Executive. So our amendment is more consistent with the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement than the clause or the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; document says that the Executive are supposed to make the appointment. Perhaps the Secretary of State or the Minister of State will tell us why the legislation did not say that the Executive as opposed the First and Deputy First Minister were to make the appointment so that there could be a collective decision by the Executive rather than a decision by just two Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.1/1">I fully accept the point, and I hope that the Secretary of State and the Minister have heard it. It would be useful if they could address it.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/2">It is unfortunate that, every time something is referred to as a role of the Executive it ends up becoming an appointment by the First and Deputy First Minister. With all that can be said about their acting jointly, people know that the habit has been that distinct and separate appointments have been made. There is not the trust in the appointments system. It is very like what Macaulay said about Disraeli and Gladstone. One of them is a charlatan and knows it; the other is a charlatan and doesn&#8217;t know it. So people do not have full confidence in the appointments system when something wider is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/3">The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement specifies that a number of things will be done by the Executive. The work towards an end of paramilitarism and a lot of other commitments in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement are put in the name of the Executive. I will be addressing the limitations of that in subsequent amendments and new clauses. We are meant to have an approach that is about all the parties, and all the parties may not be on the Executive. If this is about an all-party approach, we should be creating mechanisms that involve all the parties and we should not pretend that these issues will become the sole responsibility or property of the Executive. Nor should we pretend that the due responsibility of the Executive is discharged simply by the First and Deputy First Minister making appointments. I do not believe that any of that is adequate.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/4">The fact that we needed to be back in Stormont House for talks on the negotiations after the crisis showed it was not sufficient that things were done between the First and Deputy First Minister. We had a crisis and needed all-party talks to bring us back from the brink. The First and Deputy First Minister&#8217;s positions and parties had brought us to the brink. Now we seem to be ending up with mechanisms that mean that everything will be done by the First and Deputy First Minister in future. So none of the lessons has been learned. None of the mistakes in the scoping of past negotiations, the scoping of the agenda or the politics of how these things are managed has been learned from.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/5">I know that the amendment has been tabled by the Ulster Unionist party in respect of the role being conferred on the Policing Board. As the party which argued most in the Stormont House negotiations that the key roles in the Historical Investigations Unit should be appointed by the Policing Board, I do not agree with the amendment. After all, the HIU has a role which will involve constabulary powers. If there is a policing element to it, the evidence can be gathered, investigated and referred for prosecution. The role of the reporting commission is quite different. Nobody saw that there would be huge tension&#8212;apart from dealing with some of the cases that have already been looked at by the Historical Enquiries Team&#8212;between the role of the Chief Constable and the PSNI, and the role of the HIU.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.1/6">There could, arguably, be difficulties between the reporting commission and the Chief Constable. For example, last year in the aftermath of the two murders, when the Chief Constable made a assessment that shared publicly the police&#8217;s working theories in relation to that murder, something of a political crisis was created and a panel was set up to look at those issues, including to say whether it accepted what the Chief Constable had said. It would be odd if the reporting commission, which was in part appointed by the Policing Board, had to look at issues that had been the subject of comment by the Chief Constable. That might be a dilemma for the Policing Board and might raise tensions. I do not believe that the Policing Board appointment answers the question.</p>

	<p pid="b.473.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that his party was to the fore in proposing that the Policing Board would be instrumental in the appointment of senior members of the HIU? There could easily be a conflict between the HIU director or directors and the police. If the proposed arrangement will work for the HIU, I do not see why it should not work for the reporting commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.473.1/1">I do not think the potential conflict would be the same. Obviously, there is the issue that was considered in the talks that some of the cases that had already been dealt with by the HET are currently the subject of PSNI investigation. Whether they will be referred to the HIU or reopened by the ombudsman is a factor in that. The prospect of any potential tension around the Chief Constable&#8217;s role was among the reasons why we said that appointment by the Policing Board would be a sensible way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.1/2">A different issue arises in relation to the role of the reporting commission. If we take the example of the controversies last year, the panel, which was a proto make-do version of the reporting commission, had to examine issues on which the Chief Constable had spoken, and rightly spoken.

	<p pid="b.473.2/1">I think the hon. Gentleman was arguing that in future the Executive may not consist of all five parties and there will be parties in Opposition. In that situation, would it not make sense for the commission, whose job is to hold the Executive and the two Governments to account, to have its members appointed by the Assembly and the Parliaments, rather than the Executive?</p>

	<p pid="b.473.3/1">There is a wider possibility in that, which may take us further away from what was said in the Stormont House agreement. The hon. Gentleman is right. We need to ensure an all-party approach and we will address that problem in future amendments and new clauses, which I will not venture into now.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.3/2">We believe that the way in which the Government have taken matters forward and the way in which the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement has been framed do not recruit and keep engaged the span of cross-party interest that there should be both in the Assembly and beyond. It mistakenly shorthands too much to the Executive, then translates that as meaning simply First and Deputy First Ministers, with all the limitations and difficulties that that brings.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.3/3">Furthermore, with the Commission appointed in that way by the Assembly, the process for doing that would become more complicated, and it is complicated enough at the Policing Board level. We think that appointment by the Justice Minister, following consultation&#8212;properly to give them their due&#8212;with the First and Deputy First Ministers, in agreement with the Executive, would be a way of reflecting some of the wider interests without creating difficulties for the Policing Board, adding to the list of appointments that it makes, and maybe creating tensions with some of its other appointment roles.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.3/4">It should be recognised that the issues that have been highlighted by both the Ulster Unionist party and ourselves in respect of the appointments are not the only questions that should be asked in respect of the ill-defined role of the reporting commission, and how well that sits with the wider responsibilities that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24965" name="Nigel Mills">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> referred to. If we are serious about the whole community approach alongside the enforcement approach, there needs to be something much more collective and better defined than the Government have provided for in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.0/1">It is appropriate that I place on record at the outset our appreciation for the independent reporting commission, the creation of which is important. I think I speak for the whole Committee in welcoming it.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/2">Our debate on amendments 1 and 7 illustrates one of the great problems faced by any of us involved in the politics of Northern Ireland: the search for independence. With a population of 1.7 million, where, as is often said, everybody knows everybody, it is almost impossible to find anybody who is completely Simon-pure and separated from any accusation of community bias. The search for that person who is completely independent has in the past taken us to Finland, to South Africa, to Canada, and to Canada and back to Canada, and it will probably continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/3">It is intensely important that we realise that we are dealing with a conflict between aspiration and actuality. Everybody wants a completely independent nominating system, but nobody whom I have yet heard can come up with a mechanism to achieve that beyond peradventure and beyond criticism.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.1/1">In his comments, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not mean to cast any sort of aspersions on the composition of the Independent Monitoring Commission, which did monitor and did report. The proposed body will do both and will be called the independent reporting commission. We had Lord Alderdice, John Grieve, a retired senior member of the Garda Siochana and a retired American police officer, who did a fantastic job on the Independent Monitoring Commission. I am sure the hon. Gentleman meant to add a sentence to say that we had full confidence in their independence in the IMC.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.2/1">That is precisely what I was about to say. The point I was making is that we may succeed. Quite often we succeed, but sometimes it is against the odds. The search for that additional independence continues. The hon. Lady is, as ever, completely right in this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.2/2">When <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase> introduced amendment 1, he was right to mention some of atrocities&#8212;not just the recent atrocities, but the murders of Paul Quinn and Robert McCartney. I spent a great deal of time with Paul Quinn&#8217;s parents, and it is important that we never forget that horrific murder. Even though it was some years ago, the memory is still raw.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> focused the debate by talking about the veto safeguard that exists in the current system. It is immensely important that we realise the significance of that. If we are trying to find a mechanism for a nomination process, the proposed process is about as close as we are going to get. I will listen with interest to what the Government say, but we also need to pay attention to amendment 7, which was tabled by the SDLP. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11589" name="Mark Durkan">The hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> pointed out, rightly, that the predecessor to the current Secretary of State had some of these issues pointed out to him at the time. It would have been better if we had considered them then, instead of now.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.2/4">Just as these amendments illustrate one of the problems of finding people to appoint who are beyond criticism, they also illustrate one of the great strengths of Northern Ireland politics. Even when politicians are elected from a particular community, and may even be from a particular community, there has never been, in my hearing, any suggestion that they have failed to represent every aspect of their community. That is noteworthy, and we say it far too rarely on the Floor of the House. That aspect of life in Northern Ireland gives me great hope for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.2/5">The Opposition support the Government on this issue, which is an unusual position for me to be in. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10121" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase> and I would like to hear more about these issues, and particularly about the points made in amendment 7, but for the time being, we think that the clause is about as good as we are going to get.</p>

	<p pid="b.475.0/1">It is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby. I thank hon. Members for their contributions and for the suggestions that they have made in the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/2">As we have discussed, the first five clauses of this short Bill concern the independent reporting commission. This new body is one of a raft of measures set out in November&#8217;s &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement to tackle the ongoing impact of paramilitary activity. The commission, which is to be established through an international agreement between the United Kingdom Government and the Irish Government, will have an overriding objective to promote progress towards ending paramilitary activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/3">Although the IRC has different functions from the Independent Monitoring Commission, it builds on the precedent set by that commission, which was in operation between 2004 and 2011, monitoring activity by paramilitary groups and overseeing implementation of security normalisation measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/4">I will now speak about the clauses and related amendments. Clause 1 makes reference to the functions of the new independent reporting commission, as set out in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. Those will be: to report annually on progress towards ending paramilitary activity; to report on the implementation of the measures of the Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government to tackle paramilitary activity, including overseeing implementation of the Executive&#8217;s strategy to end paramilitarism; and to consult a wide range of stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies, local councils, communities and civic society organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/5">The reports of the commission will inform the Executive&#8217;s programme for government through to 2021. The commission will be independent of the sponsoring Governments and will have significant discretion in fulfilling its functions. That independence will help to ensure the credibility of its reports and its success in engaging with the necessary range of stakeholders. The Secretary of State may provide the commission with such resources and funding as she considers appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/6">Finally, in line with the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, the commission will be made up of four members&#8212;one nominated by the UK Government, one by the Irish Government and two by the Executive. Clause 1(4) confers on the First and Deputy First Ministers the power to jointly nominate the Executive members.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/7">Two amendments have been tabled to that subsection. In amendment 1, the hon. Members for South Antrim (Danny Kinahan) and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott) propose that the power to nominate two members be conferred on the Northern Ireland Policing Board instead of the First and Deputy First Ministers. The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement provides that two members of the new commission will be nominated by the Executive. The Northern Ireland Policing Board is not, however, part of the Executive, and the amendment would therefore not be consistent with the terms of that agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/8">In amendment 7, the hon. Members for Foyle (Mark Durkan), for South Down (Ms Ritchie) and for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell) propose that the power to nominate be conferred on the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, following consultation with the First Ministers, and subject to the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive Committee. While the Government recognise the interest that the Justice Minister, in particular, will have in the nominations, it is our view that the First and Deputy First Ministers, acting jointly, are the most appropriate office holders to nominate members on behalf of the Executive as a whole, in view of the objective and functions of the commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.475.0/9">We would of course encourage the First and Deputy First Ministers to consult their Executive colleagues&#8212;in particular the Justice Minister&#8212;before making nominations. It is also open to the First and Deputy First Ministers to refer the nominations to the Executive Committee and, indeed, to consult more widely. For example, amendment 1 proposes a role for the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and that could certainly provide helpful recommendations regarding candidates for nomination. I also noted that the hon. Member for Foyle highlighted the difference between the HIU and the IRC&#8212;two different bodies with very different functions. His point is well made when it comes to the reference to the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>

	<p pid="b.477.0/1">The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is certainly not prohibited from examining the appointment by the UK Government, and it will no doubt be able to make recommendations or to make its views known. As to whether that is formally part of the process, the best thing, as I said, is to reflect on that. If my hon. Friend would like, I will write to him with a response or, hopefully, get back to him before the Bill&#8217;s stages are completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.0/2">I turn now to clauses 2 to 5. Clause 2 deals with the exercise of the functions of the new commission. The clause provides that the objective of the commission is to promote progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland. The commission will be required to exercise its functions in the way it considers most appropriate for meeting that objective.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.0/3">The commission will also be under the duties not to: prejudice the national security interests of the United Kingdom or Ireland; put at risk the life or safety of any person; have a prejudicial effect on the prevention, investigation or detection of crime; or have a prejudicial effect on any actual or prospective legal proceedings. With the exception of the duty not to have a prejudicial effect on the prevention, investigation or detection of crime, those were all duties to which the Independent Monitoring Commission was subject. The new duty is now considered necessary given the shift in investigative responsibility for paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. Its intention is to ensure that the Police Service of Northern Ireland can engage fully and meaningfully with the commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.477.1/3">For the record, will the Minister confirm that the commission is absolutely free&#8212;actually, that it will be called on&#8212;to report that paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland may well be initiated, instigated or supported from within the Republic of Ireland?</p>

	<p pid="b.477.2/1">The IRC, obviously in conjunction with the duties I mentioned, will be free to report on anything of that nature. It is not only the UK Government who are keen to pursue this, but the Government of the Republic of Ireland. I think that both Governments recognise that this cannot be done in a vacuum, with Northern Ireland entirely carved out of paramilitary activity on the island of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.2/2">In respect of the duties not to prejudice national security interests and not to put at risk the life or safety of any person, the Secretary of State must issue guidance to the commission about the exercise of its functions, in so far as the commission&#8217;s functions touch on the disclosure of information that might be prejudicial to those duties.</p>

I want to be a little clearer about whether it is just that the guidance will be published, or whether Parliament will get a chance to look at what the guidance is or is not.</p>

	<p pid="b.478.0/1">Parliament will certainly have an opportunity to scrutinise the guidance as published. As for the timescale, that will be dictated by how quickly the nominations of the commissioners are made. However, we do not take this lightly. The guidance is very important and everyone needs to know where they stand with it, which is why I welcome the fact that it is going to be published. I will get some clarity for the hon. Gentleman on whether the guidance will be done by regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/2">The guidance referred to in clause 2(5)(a) is intended to assist the commission in the discharge of its duty under clause 2(3)(a), which is not to do anything that would prejudice national security. However, we recognise that, while many of the same principles may apply to the protection of national security interests in Ireland as in the United Kingdom, it is not appropriate for the Government to issue detailed guidance about national security matters in another jurisdiction, and it was never the Government&#8217;s intention to attempt to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/3">To avoid any doubt about the matter, we propose to remove the reference to Ireland in clause 2(5)(a). The practical effect of the amendment will be that the Secretary of State will be required to issue guidance to the commission in respect of its functions in relation to information that, if disclosed, might prejudice national security, but the guidance will not deal with information that might prejudice the national security interests of Ireland. The guidance will continue to cover information that might put at risk the life or safety of any people.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/4">As provided in the Bill, the commission will still be required to have regard to the guidance, and the Secretary of State will remain able to amend or replace the guidance as necessary. The guidance will still be published when issued. I can also confirm that the guidance will be published and a copy will be placed in the Library of each House. The guidance will be made available to the commission before it begins its operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/5">Clause 2, as amended, seeks to secure an appropriate balance between the provision of important safeguards in relation to the exercise of the commission&#8217;s functions, and ensuring that the commission has the independence and discretion it needs to deliver effectively on those functions.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/6">Clause 3 confers on the independent reporting commission immunity from suit and legal process, and inviolability of its official archive and premises. In practice, that means that the commission will not be subject to legal challenge or process, including civil claims and judicial review. It also means that its premises and archive cannot be subject to search of requisition, as is the case with a diplomatic mission.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/7">Those legal privileges are routinely given to international organisations and, indeed, there are a number of recent examples in the Northern Ireland context, including the Independent Monitoring Commission, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&#8217; Remains and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/8">The legal privileges serve two key purposes. First, they ensure that the commission cannot be compelled to disclose material it holds, including the identities of those who have provided information. That is crucial to ensuring that the commission is able to reach out to a wide range of sources in pursuit of information on paramilitary activity and thus fulfil its role in promoting the ending of it. IMC commissioners recognised that point in their final report, stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/9">&#8220;These immunities were fundamental to our ability to operate.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/10">In addition, the legal privileges are essential to protecting the independence of this new body. They ensure that it cannot be challenged by those who may be the subject of its reports, or by the sponsoring Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.0/11">Clause 3 also enables the commission to waive its legal privileges where it deems appropriate. That is key to the proportionality of the provisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.479.0/1">The Minister has been very specific in what he has said about archives.

	<p pid="b.479.1/1">It does not affect that at all. The independent commission will be able to draw on sources from wherever it needs to in order to construct its report and carry out its monitoring purposes. There is nothing more I can say about that, other than that we hope that it will be a proactive body that uses open source and every other area of information possible to come up with robust and respected reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/2">On the appropriateness of the legal privileges, if a staff member wished to make a claim to an employment tribunal, the commission could waive its immunity from legal process to allow that person to pursue the claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/3">Finally, clause 3 also confers on the Secretary of State the power to confer by regulations certain further privileges on the commission itself, commissioners and staff, and members of their households. Conferring such immunities in secondary legislation will allow flexibility in making decisions on the exercise of this power on a case-by-case basis. In line with similar provisions in the Acts establishing the IMC and ICLVR, the power is subject to the negative procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/4">Clause 4 is a short clause setting out the key terminology used in the Bill for the new independent reporting commission. It includes a reference to the</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/5">&#8220;agreement relating to paramilitary activity&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.479.1/6">which is the international agreement between the UK and Irish Governments that will establish the commission. Work on the agreement is at an advanced stage, but hon. Members will understand that the timing of the Irish general election has meant that it is not yet formally agreed.

	<p pid="b.479.2/1">The Minister said in our previous debate that the definition of &#8220;paramilitary activity&#8221; would be determined by the commission, but does he have any idea what the Republic of Ireland&#8217;s definition is of that term?</p>

	<p pid="b.480.0/1">I cannot answer for the Irish Government; we have to leave that up to them. Our purpose is to allow the commission to come up with a definition and to prosecute it in the pursuit of making its reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/2">It is our clear intention to lay the treaty before Parliament before, or at the same time as, the regulations to be made under clause 4. As will be clear, the Bill sets out the broad framework for the commission. It references the functions in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement and sets out the key duties to which the commission will be subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/3">Further details will be required in secondary legislation to give full effect to the international agreement. Clause 4(2) therefore provides such a power, which may be used to make provision about accounts and audit, for example, or about majority decision making, or other key aspects of the agreement. I recognise that that is a relatively broad power and that the regulations to underpin the new commission are likely to be of interest to hon. Members. The regulations will, therefore, be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/4">Clause 5 makes provision about the conclusion of the commission&#8217;s work. The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement provides that the work of the commission will inform future Northern Ireland Executive programme for Government priorities and commitments through to 2021.</p>

	<p pid="b.480.4/1">The clue is in the word &#8220;appropriate&#8221;. We want to set up the commission and make sure that it carries the momentum of public opinion to resolve the issue of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. Our view is that the best way to do that is to assign to two officeholders&#8212;the First and Deputy First Ministers&#8212; the authority to nominate two members of the four-member commission. That is the decision the Government have taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.4/2">I have read the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment 7. The First and Deputy First Ministers do not operate in isolation in the Executive; they consult and speak to Ministers on a daily basis. That may not be his experience, but it has certainly been mine since I was appointed. I want to place on the record my admiration for the current Justice Minister, David Ford, and what he has done over the past few years, and I am sad that he has said that he will not continue in that role. He is incredibly well respected in the Executive, and it is our view that the First and Deputy First Ministers do speak to him and regularly consult him. Perhaps they do not do so as much as the hon. Gentleman might like, but they would be unwise to not consult that office in any future debate.</p>

I am talking about clause 5, on the conclusion of the commission&#8217;s work, about which the Minister has been speaking. The hon.

	<p pid="b.481.4/1">Before I move on, I refer hon. Members again to the word &#8220;appropriate&#8221;. The winding up of the commission is some years hence. What the commission looks like, how it behaves and the importance that is attached to it at the time of winding up will dictate the most appropriate people, office holders and agencies to consult in that winding up. I do not intend to restrict the Government to commitments about specific individuals other than those set out in the subsection about whom we must consult. It is clear that we would consult the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and the relevant Minister in the Government of Ireland, because of the nature of the international treaty with the Irish Government. Indeed, the leaders of the Executive in Northern Ireland, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, would have to be involved, given that they are involved in the set-up of the body.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.4/2">However, when it comes to what is appropriate at the time, I do not think I should hold to hostage a future Government, a future Minister or anybody else on something that may or may not happen in five, six, seven, 10 or however many years&#8217; time. That is why the Bill states quite clearly: as &#8220;appropriate&#8221;. If I were winding up the commission right now, I would consult a range of stakeholders, including the Justice Minister, but I am not going to prescribe in legislation individual people whom it may not be appropriate to consult in a few years&#8217; time.</p>

	<p pid="b.482.1/1">I want to move on. We have fought a bit, and I know that hon. Members are keen to get on to the next group of amendments. Clause 5 provides that the Secretary of State may make regulations to wind up the commission, as I have said. Before making such regulations, we will confer with all the stakeholders. The clause provides that regulations to wind up the commission may amend, repeal or revoke an enactment. Similar provision was included in the Act that founded the IMC, the Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission etc.) Act 2003, which granted the Secretary of State the power to provide, by order, that key provisions of that Act would cease to have effect. That power was exercised in 2011, effectively winding up the IMC. The clause also provides that such regulations may confer functions on the Secretary of State or any other person, and may make provision about the destruction of information or records held by the commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.482.1/2">The new independent reporting commission will fulfil an important role in tackling paramilitary activity, in furtherance of the Government&#8217;s commitment to challenging all paramilitary activity and associated criminality.

	<p pid="b.482.2/1">It is quite clear that neither the Government nor other parties support amendment 1, so it would be difficult for us to win a vote on it.

Equally, we think there are some questions about the other clauses in the group, which the Government should continue to address. In his response to our points about the limitations of clause 5, the Minister did not reinforce the sort of encouragement that he has said the Government want to give the First Minister and Deputy First Minister about consultation.

	<p pid="b.485.0/1">I will speak to clauses 6, 7 and 8 and the related schedules, which extend the time available for the formation of the Executive after an election and provide for important commitments by Ministers and Members of the Legislative Assembly on tackling paramilitarism. I will also make a few remarks about the amendments in this group and I look forward to hearing the statements of the hon. Members who have proposed them.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/2">Clause 6(1) amends the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to allow 14 rather than seven days for the allocation of ministerial positions in the Executive after the first meeting of the Assembly following an election. The proposed extension will allow the parties more time to agree a programme for government on a cross-party basis prior to the allocation of ministerial positions. That commitment first appeared in the 2014 Stormont House agreement and was reaffirmed in the recent &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/3">Schedule 1 makes transitional provision for the upcoming Assembly elections in May. Ordinarily, Assembly Standing Orders would require that ministerial posts are filled within seven days of the creation of a new Department. Schedule 1 makes it clear that where the event coincides with the period following the forthcoming election before the allocation of Ministers to Executive positions, the 14-day time limit for the formation of the Executive takes precedence. That will ensure that the period for the appointment of ministerial offices following the next Assembly election will not be inadvertently shortened as a result of changes flowing from the Assembly&#8217;s Departments Bill. I hope that the extension in time for ministerial appointments will provide helpful flexibility to all political parties in Northern Ireland involved in the formation of the Executive on the basis of a shared programme for Government following the upcoming elections and all future elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/4">Clause 7, in line with the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, amends the pledge of office that all Northern Ireland Executive Ministers are required to affirm before taking up ministerial office. The clause inserts seven new commitments into the pledge. These were set out in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, and the wording for the pledge faithfully reflects the agreement. The commitments build on existing principles of support for the rule of law and reflect a collective political determination to achieve a society free of paramilitarism. In the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, the parties agreed not simply to a passive acceptance of the values set out in the amendment to the pledge, but to an active fulfilment of them. The clause enshrines these political commitments in the pledge of office for Northern Ireland Executive Ministers through an amendment to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/5">I now turn to amendments 8 and 9. My remarks apply equally to amendments 13 and 14, which seek to make the same changes to clause 8 on the new undertakings for MLAs. I will say more about them shortly. The pledge as drafted faithfully reflects the wording of the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. I understand there is some concern about a perceived contradiction in the wording of the pledge and the undertaking as drafted. I hope to assure hon. Members that that is not the case. I do not think the wording needs to be changed. I agree that there can be no excuse for supporting paramilitary activity, but a transition away from paramilitarism can be achieved only with effective political engagement in communities. I do not believe there is any contradiction between taking a firm stance against paramilitary activity and supporting groups transitioning away from that activity. To encourage such a move is consistent with the other commitments required from Ministers and MLAs under clauses 6 to 8, such as the commitment to challenge paramilitary attempts to control communities and associated criminality.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/6">Politicians need, as ever, to ensure that their engagements are in line with the responsibilities of their office, and those engagements must be in keeping with the commitments contained in the agreement and in the Bill. Furthermore, the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement represents a collective political agreement by the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK and Irish Governments. The wording that was agreed was carefully constructed, and it demonstrates an important and symbolic political commitment to ending the influence of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland. Changing the structure and substance of the commitments, as proposed in these amendments, would unpick that political agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/7">I understand from the explanatory statement that amendment 10 is intended to refer to paragraph (f), rather than paragraph (e), of the existing pledge of office in schedule 4 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/8">&#8220;to support, and act in accordance with, all decisions of the Executive Committee and Assembly&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/9">I do not agree&#8212;nor do the Government&#8212;that there is any need to caveat one part of the pledge with another. The pledge will be read as a whole and, taken as a whole, the pledge represents a binding commitment by Executive Ministers to operate within the structures of the Executive Committee and the Assembly, and to accept no outside influence on their political activities. In any event, changing the substance of these commitments, as proposed in the amendment, would unpick the carefully constructed political agreement reached through the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/10">On amendment 11, the arrangements for the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to affirm the terms of the pledge within specified time limits are set out in the Standing Orders of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Bill, as drafted, makes no change to those arrangements. I agree that the pledge of office is of great importance, particularly for the Ministers who will lead the Executive, but I do not agree that there is any need to require the pledge to be read out orally in full in front of the Assembly. The Belfast agreement commits that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will affirm the terms of the pledge of office, and that is exactly what the existing provision in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires. The changes to the ministerial pledge of office introduced by clause 7 flow directly from the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, but the proposed amendment would amend the process by which the terms of the pledge are affirmed by the First Minster and Deputy First Minister. In the talks that led to the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, there was no political consensus on making any additional changes to the existing process for affirming the terms of the pledge.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/11">On amendment 12, the commitments in the pledge reflect the firm resolution of the Northern Ireland parties in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement to end the influence of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland. I am confident that Northern Ireland Ministers will uphold the terms of the enhanced pledge as they work collectively to achieve a society free of paramilitarism. There are already mechanisms in place that allow the Assembly to deal with breaches of the ministerial pledge by censuring a Minister, reducing their salary or even removing them from office. In addition, Ministers can be held accountable by judicial review in the courts for an alleged breach of the pledge of office. The Bill makes no changes to those existing measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/12">The intended effect of amendment 12 was not dealt with under the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, and these are not therefore matters to be settled under this Bill. Should the Assembly wish to bring matters about alleged breaches of the pledge within the remit of the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, the Northern Ireland Assembly could do so, but that could clearly be done only on the basis of cross-community consensus on such a measure. Furthermore, it would be very unusual to make a change of the kind proposed in the amendment without cross-community consensus in Northern Ireland, and there is no such consensus at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/13">Clause 8 and schedule 2, in line with the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, make provision for a new undertaking to be given by all Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The undertaking for MLAs is based on the same seven commitments on tackling paramilitarism that have been added to the pledge of office for Ministers. For the first time, Members will have to give the undertaking before they can participate in Assembly proceedings or receive any of the rights or privileges enjoyed by Members who have taken their seat. The Northern Ireland Act prohibits the Assembly from requiring its Members to make an oath or declaration as a condition of office. It would not be possible for the Assembly to implement this &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; commitment without Westminster legislation to introduce the undertaking. Schedule 2 makes transitional provision for the procedure for giving the undertaking after the Assembly election in May 2016 only. After that, the procedure will be set out in the Assembly&#8217;s Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/14">There are two minor Government amendments to schedule 2&#8212;amendments 4 and 5. Under existing law, the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly remains in office after its dissolution and may chair the first meeting of the new Assembly, even if they are not a Member of it. The amendments ensure that an outgoing Speaker who has not been re-elected to the Assembly can determine the transitional procedure for the new undertaking for MLAs while chairing the first meeting of the new Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/15">Amendments 6 and 17 propose changes to the way that the Assembly holds its Members to account for adherence to the new undertaking. Amendment 6 would require the Assembly to introduce a sanctions mechanism, and amendment 17 proposes that oversight should fall to the Northern Ireland Assembly Commissioner for Standards. The Assembly already has the power to introduce sanctions for breach of the undertaking by Members, should it consider that such sanctions are warranted. There are established mechanisms for holding MLAs to account for their adherence to the Assembly code of conduct through the Assembly&#8217;s Committee on Standards and Privileges and the independent Commissioner for Standards. There is considerable value in the Assembly, not this House, determining how MLAs should be held to account for any breaches of the new undertaking, in line with the present arrangements for the scrutiny of MLAs. Any changes would of course need to be built on cross-community support in the Assembly. I believe it is right that Assembly Members should be subject to scrutiny for their conduct, and I encourage the Assembly to consider carefully how that might be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/16">On amendment 15, there was no commitment under the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement for the pledge and the undertaking to bind any persons other than Ministers and MLAs respectively. While there may be merit in encouraging all those holding public office to follow the example set by Northern Ireland&#8217;s Assembly Members and abide by the spirit of the undertaking, any move to make a binding requirement on a wider group of public officials would require political and cross-community consensus. There is currently no such consensus.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/17">Members of this House will be interested to note that local councillors in Northern Ireland are already required under law to make a declaration against terrorism before they can validly stand for election locally. They are also required to make a further declaration regarding the standards of conduct they will be guided by in office before they can so act.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/18">On amendment 16, the undertaking as drafted in clause 8 faithfully reflects the wording in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement in a way that is sufficiently certain for the purposes of this legislation. On Second Reading, hon. Members pointed to the need for MLAs to work with a wide range of people, in addition to other Assembly Members, to achieve the disbandment of paramilitary organisations. I agree that this important task will require MLAs, and indeed political parties as a whole, to work with stakeholders as well as their Assembly colleagues, but the commitment as drafted does not limit the ability of MLAs to do so. The other commitments support an holistic approach to this task&#8212;for example, the commitment to support those who are determined to make the transition away from paramilitarism is likely, in practice, to require MLAs to work with other stakeholders. I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, but I do not believe that any amendment is necessary to achieve it. I believe it makes sense for an undertaking by MLAs, made as they are taking their Assembly seats, to refer to working with their Assembly colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.0/19">I look forward to hearing hon. Members&#8217; contributions on the issues. For the reasons I have set out, I urge them not to press their amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.488.0/1">May I ask the Minister a slightly complicated drafting question? I cannot see how the pledge and the undertaking in clauses 7 and 8 are restricted only to paramilitarism in relation to Northern Ireland. It may be a bit of an onerous duty to expect people to challenge all paramilitary activity anywhere in the world. If a</p>
	<p pid="b.488.0/2">Member of the Assembly expressed support for the peshmerga or the Free Syrian Army, which are probably paramilitaries under any natural definition, they would face some kind of sanction.

	<p pid="b.489.0/1">I think the best solution is for me to write to my hon. Friend on that technical question. I do not think that anyone in the United Kingdom, or in any democracy, would propose supporting paramilitaries, be they here or abroad.</p>

	<p pid="b.489.1/1">It is good to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Edward, while we discuss this important Bill, and I will say now that unless the Minister gives me a satisfactory reply, I am minded to divide the Committee on amendment 6.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/2">Amendment 6 strives radically to improve clause 8, and I cannot believe that the Minister does not think that that is necessary&#8212;the clause certainly needs to be radically improved. We have just spent at least an hour in a useful debate on the establishment of yet another commission in Northern Ireland, namely the independent reporting commission. I am delighted that under clause 2, the primary objective of that commission will be to</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/3">&#8220;promote progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/4">It is long overdue for the people of Northern Ireland to be rid of the scourge of paramilitary activity. They will be delighted with that commission when it is established, and will have confidence in it doing a good job.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/5">On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said something important about the Stormont House agreement, which the Minister has cited regularly in his opening remarks. She stated that that agreement</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/6">&#8220;places fresh obligations on Northern Ireland&#8217;s political representatives to work together with determination to rid society of paramilitary activity and groups.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2016-02-22.70"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 February 2016; Vol. 606, c. 70</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/7">I say &#8220;hear hear&#8221; to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/8">As the Minister rightly explained, clause 8 introduces an undertaking that all MLAs must give before they can participate in any of the Assembly&#8217;s proceedings, and as drafted, it goes to great lengths to set out the terms of that undertaking. Among other things, it means that before an MLA can participate in any Assembly proceedings, they must pledge to support the rule of law and to challenge all paramilitary activity and associated criminality. Those are two of the detailed provisions in that new undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/9">Having gone to such extraordinary lengths to draft that new undertaking to comply with the Stormont House agreement, the glaring omission&#8212;we cannot possibly allow this to get through the Committee unamended&#8212;is that no provisions refer to Standing Orders that will investigate alleged breaches of that undertaking, and no Standing Orders will impose sanctions on MLAs who are found to be guilty of such a breach. Let us hope that no MLA would ever stoop so low as to breach their own undertaking, but if such an allegation is made it must be investigated, and if the MLA is found to be guilty, there must be sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/10">The current drafting of clause 8(1)(2) is interesting, because we are already quite happy that:</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/11">&#8220;Standing Orders shall provide for the procedure for giving the undertaking.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/12">We are a sovereign Parliament&#8212;how often have I heard in recent weeks that sovereignty belongs to this Parliament&#8212;and the beauty of my amendment is that it simply adds to what we already have. Standing Orders will be introduced by the Assembly to investigate alleged breaches of the undertaking by MLAs, and to impose sanctions on MLAs who are in breach of that undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/13">When I made that suggestion on Second Reading, the Secretary of State said in response to an intervention about sanctions:</p>
	<p pid="b.489.1/14">&#8220;In terms of internal matters of discipline within the Assembly, that really is a matter for the Assembly itself to determine.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2016-02-22.72"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 February 2016; Vol. 606, c. 72</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="b.490.0/1">Does the hon. Lady accept that the only sanction in the Bill is that those who do not give the undertaking in the first place cannot participate in the Assembly? There is not even a limit on how much time can pass before they can be expelled. In the light of some of the comments recently made by Sinn F&#233;in, which said that republicans could use violence at another time, it is important that MLAs make that undertaking in the Stormont House agreement and are kept to it. If they make subsequent statements, there should be a process for investigating that and deciding what punishment should be imposed.</p>

	<p pid="b.490.1/1">That is absolutely correct. The glaring omission&#8212;I am repeating myself, but it is worth repetition&#8212;is that although we have introduced a new undertaking for MLAs, that is not the same as the Minister&#8217;s pledge of office. That has been extended, and the Minister rightly read out the sanctions for Ministers who breach their pledge. This undertaking is completely new for all MLAs, and it is the duty of this Committee to ensure that when the Bill leaves this place, it is fit for purpose. The Bill has been introduced to get rid of paramilitary activity and associated criminality, which has been the scourge of Northern Ireland for years and years. For goodness&#8217; sake, let us do it right!</p>
	<p pid="b.490.1/2">The beauty of my amendment is that it does not interfere with the domestic arrangements and internal workings of the Assembly. It simply ensures that Standing Orders will be introduced by the Assembly, and that there will be a process of investigation and sanctions for a breach of the undertaking. That is not interfering with the Assembly&#8217;s internal discipline. That is my amendment, and if the Minister is unable to give me a satisfactory reassurance on that issue at the end of the debate, I will push the amendment to a vote.</p>

But there are people in society who are very aware of where she is, and some of those people have been named in the press. May I encourage the hon. Lady to make this statement, which I will also be making: there are people who have information about this, so let them come to the police, tell them where the body is and give Lisa Dorrian&#8217;s family the peace of mind that they need?</p>

	<p pid="b.491.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, as he is right in everything he has said. Lisa Dorrian, a young lady in her early 20s, was disappeared and murdered 11 years ago, and her family have never had the peace of mind that comes with a Christian burial. Her remains have never been found, despite the valiant efforts of the PSNI&#8212;and I put that on the record. There are others who were disappeared by the IRA, such as Columba McVeigh, a young man from Donaghmore whose remains have never been found. There is pain and grief on all sides. As I say, paramilitarism has been a dreadful scourge across the face of Northern Ireland for far, far too long. I have the highest regard for this Minister, so when he gets up I do not want to hear the Stormont House agreement cited as a reason why we cannot put into this Bill this afternoon a requirement that Standing Orders are introduced by the Assembly. No detail is being provided about the sanctions or about the investigative procedure in respect of a breach of the undertaking. The very least we can do for the people of Northern Ireland, including the grieving parents of Lisa Dorrian and Columba McVeigh, although his mother passed away some time ago&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.492.4/1">I am grateful for that helpful intervention, as ever, from the hon. Gentleman. I am sure the Minister and the Government would not like to be accused of being inconsistent. We have to be consistent here. A consistent approach has to be taken to the eradication, once and for all, of paramilitary activity and all its criminality in Northern Ireland. The Minister will have read this Bill many times and when he carefully reads it again, he will know that the precedent has already been set.

	<p pid="b.492.5/1">A number of Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>, who raises this issue again through her amendment, have asked questions about the content and policing of the pledge and undertaking. That was done on Second Reading by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11589" name="Mark Durkan">the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase>, as well as by the hon. Lady, who has enunciated her views on the principle again today.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/2">I shall speak to my party&#8217;s amendments. Amendment 10 refers to paragraph (e) in schedule 4 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and clarifies that Ministers are already subject to a requirement to act in accordance with all decisions made by the Executive and the Assembly. Amendment 16 deals with clause 8, inserting the words &#8220;others, including&#8221; in the reference to MLAs. The provision might seem small, but it is central to the whole-community approach that will be needed to tackle paramilitary activity. It would compel Members of the Assembly to work with civic society in Northern Ireland, reflecting our approach during the Stormont House agreement of having that community approach to ridding Northern Ireland of paramilitarism.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/3">I agree with the hon. Lady that paramilitarism has been a scourge and a cancer in our society, right across the community, and we want rid of it, but we also believe that there must be adherence the best democratic principles within our elected institutions. Our reference in amendment 15 to the Nolan principles would ensure that this progress and political action on paramilitarism extends to MPs, councillors and all in public office. Having the First Ministers make their pledge orally at a sitting of the Assembly would publicise a cross-executive commitment to a society free from the blight of paramilitarism. In our papers for the Stormont House talks, we advocated a community approach, stating:</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/4">&#8220;Political parties ought to be showing coherent and consistent shared standards which recognise and repudiate nefarious paramilitary interests and involvements. This should reflect a shared approach which is about rooting out paramilitarism and its trace activities, not just singling out particular groups or given parties.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/5">Our amendments would clarify the terms of the pledge and undertaking and avoid further misinterpretation or a tension between different parts of the pledge and undertaking. As I have said previously, the duty in the Bill to</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/6">&#8220;support those who are determined to make the transition away from paramilitarism&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/7">is vague and could be misinterpreted as supporting someone or a group that is determined to someday move away from paramilitarism. The SDLP is in favour of support for transition away from paramilitarism, but wants to ensure that that cannot be used to cover tolerance for paramilitary activity, for which there should be no tolerance. Combining what are currently two distinct precepts of the pledge and undertaking into one would reduce that risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/8">I have direct experience of this issue. As a former Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-16">Tuesday 16 October 2007</phrase>&#8212;I remember the date exactly&#8212;I cut off funding to the conflict transformation initiative following advice from the then Chief Constable, deputy Chief Constable and others that the Ulster Defence Association was engaging in criminality. Maintaining that funding would have been construed as supporting paramilitarism, not transition, however determined the UDA was to do that someday.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/9">Like the hon. Member for North Down, we have concerns about the policing of the pledge and undertaking. Any progress on tackling paramilitary activity is undermined by any suggestion that there are no consequences for non-compliance. I note that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> was making soundings in our direction. I hope he will see fit to support our amendments on sanctions in relation to the pledge and undertaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.492.5/10">We envisage that the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints and the Northern Ireland Assembly Commissioner for Standards would receive any complaints relating to breaches of the pledge and undertaking. Both could avail themselves of the services of a pledge adjudicator on a case-by-case basis, if that was felt to be appropriate. The whole purpose of our amendments is to ensure best compliance and conformity with good democratic principles, and that we have a total move away from the scourge of paramilitarism that has been in Northern Ireland society for far too long.</p>

	<p pid="b.494.0/1">We support amendment 6, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>. There is much merit in what she says. When we ask Members of a legislature to give an undertaking that they will behave in a certain way and abide by certain principles, surely there should be some sanction when they breach those principles and their undertaking. We are not asking hon. Members&#8212;neither is the hon. Lady&#8212;to prescribe what the sanctions should be. We merely want to ensure, as is our duty as the sovereign Parliament, that the Standing Orders of the Northern Ireland Assembly reflect the need for such sanctions. It is our duty to legislate for this element of the Stormont agreement, and we believe that what the hon. Lady has proposed is sensible and prudent. This is a question of not just the politics of all this, but public confidence in the Northern Ireland Assembly, its operation and those who are elected to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.0/2">We talk about a fresh start. We have Assembly elections on <phrase class="date" code="2016-05-05">5 May</phrase>. The Members who will be elected to the Assembly for the first time after that election will be required to make this undertaking. I think that that is the appropriate moment when the Assembly should be saying that we can have no more of a situation in which some people may have been ambivalent in their attitude towards paramilitarism in the past. Everyone has to be very clear about where they stand and it is important to have the undertaking. It is also important, for public confidence and for the accountability of our public representatives, to have a sanction. It is for the Assembly to prescribe that sanction, but it is for this House to ensure that the requirement for that is in Standing Orders. We will support the hon. Lady&#8217;s amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.494.1/1">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13856" name="Margaret Ritchie">the Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie)</phrase> said, the SDLP has tabled several amendments in this issue. I take on board what the Minister said in an attempt to give a &#8220;prebuttal&#8221; of our amendments, and I will come on to amendment 6, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>, when I speak to clause 8.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/2">We have tabled amendments 8 to 12 to clause 7. The Minister tried to say there would be no tension in interpretation between different parts of the proposed pledge of office. Proposed new sub-paragraphs (cf) and (cg) of schedule 4 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/3">&#8220;to work collectively with the other members of the Executive Committee to achieve a society free of paramilitarism&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/4">and</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/5">&#8220;to challenge all paramilitary activity and associated criminality&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/6">could well find themselves in tension with another Minister&#8217;s understanding of proposed new sub-paragraph (cj), which is to</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/7">&#8220;support those who are determined to make the transition away from paramilitarism.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/8">My hon. Friend the Member for South Down described the situation in which she found herself. She tried, as stated in proposed sub-paragraph (cf), to</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/9">&#8220;work collectively with other members of the Executive&#8230;to achieve a society free of paramilitarism&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/10">and she was told at that time, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s in your Department. You do your own thing. You make that decision.&#8221; She then acted on the basis of, as in proposed sub-paragraph (cg), challenging</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/11">&#8220;all paramilitary activity and associated criminality&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/12">only to find herself undermined by other members of the Executive, who said that they were actually discharging the requirement of proposed sub-paragraph (cj) as supporting</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/13">&#8220;those who are determined to make the transition away from paramilitarism&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/14">That issue ended up in the courts, so there is already proven experience of exactly the contradictions and tensions that can exist between these things when they are different bullet points that can be quoted separately. This is a recipe for confusion, nonsense and obfuscation.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/15">We also need to recognise that people will interpret various parts of the pledge differently. Will the Minister tell us whether denying something as paramilitary activity breaches the line in the pledge to</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/16">&#8220;challenge all paramilitary activity and associated criminality&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/17">When someone turns around and says, &#8220;Oh no, so and so is not engaged in paramilitary activity or associated criminality; they are a good republican,&#8221; does that mean they are in breach of proposed sub-paragraph (cg)? Is that a failure to challenge? Is denial a failure to challenge, or can denial exist alongside the commitment to challenge all paramilitary activity, because someone can say that as paramilitary activity and associated criminality is not defined by anybody else, it is what anybody wants to define it to be? This touches on a point made earlier by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24684" name="Danny Kinahan">the hon. Member for South Antrim (Danny Kinahan)</phrase> on the earlier group.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/18">Clause 7 is wide open for misinterpretation and misapplication, which will lead to people being scandalised. It will not avoid us being in exactly the sort of crisis situation we had last year. In the aftermath of a horrible crime and comments that the Chief Constable could not avoid making, we then had political difficulties. The terms of the pledge of office and the undertaking are meant to avoid our being back in that situation, but they will clearly fail to do so. That is why we have tabled our amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/19">Amendment 8 would ensure better reconciliation between paragraphs (cf) and (cj) so that the pledge would read:</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/20">&#8220;to work collectively with the other members of the Executive Committee to achieve a society free of paramilitarism&#8230;including agreed support measures for those who are evidently making the transition away from paramilitarism&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/21">That recognises that the agreed support mechanisms would be those agreed by the Executive. It would not be people making up their own minds about what they were doing or how they were to interpret the words. The amendment seems solid and cogent.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/22">The Minister pointed out an error in our printed amendment 10, in that it refers to &#8220;paragraph (e)&#8221;, but that is because we went back to the original 1998 Act, which of course was changed, including by the St Andrew&#8217;s agreement legislation. The aim of the amendment was to ensure that the commitment in the pledge of office, taken by Ministers, to act in accordance with all decisions of the Executive Committee and the Assembly was not trumped or qualified by paragraph (ck), which reads:</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/23">&#8220;to accept no authority, direction or control on my political activities other than my democratic mandate alongside my own personal and party judgment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/24">Anyone could easily say that, in defying or failing to abide by a decision of the Executive, they were acting, in good conscience, in accordance with paragraph (ck). Why leave ourselves with such a difficulty? Our amendment would simply qualify paragraph (ck) so that it could not be read in absence of the overall commitment to respect the decisions of the Executive Committee and Assembly. I cannot see where the Minister gets his argument against that.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/25">Our amendments to clause 8 seek to make good issues similar to those addressed in our amendments to clause 7 on the pledge. There is no provision for how an alleged breach would be investigated, just as, currently, there is no clear mechanism for dealing with alleged breaches of the ministerial code, or any other breaches of the pledge of office. As the person who drafted the first terms of the pledge of office when we were negotiating the Good Friday agreement, I recognise that that has been a consistent dereliction ever since.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/26">It has been recognised several times since by various First Ministers and Deputy First Ministers that something needs to be done to make good that gap, but we keep tripping over issues and concerns that only re-open the gap, so we never actually fill it. Our amendments might not be the perfect filler, but Members should not pretend that a serious gap does not exist. What does adding these fine but confusing, inconsistent and arguable words achieve, given that there is no mechanism to investigate or to recommend that action be taken as a result of an investigation?</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/27">Our amendment 12 tries to make that good by providing that the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints&#8212;more frequently known as the Ombudsman&#8212;would receive any complaints and by giving them the power to appoint a pledge adjudicator. It might well be that some of the breaches need somebody with more legal competence or experience, so the amendment would provide for the commissioner to make such an appointment, in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/28">In respect of the pledge, we see the gap that the hon. Member for North Down talked about in respect of the undertaking in clause 8, and it was clear that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11374" name="Sammy Wilson">the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase> agreed with that logic. If we recognise the gap in the undertaking, we should also recognise the serious gap in the pledge. There are people who have their own version of what constitutes paramilitary activity. Hon. Members have referred to past murders, such as those of Robert McCartney and Paul Quinn.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/29">There were people who ended up as Ministers or senior MLAs after the Executive was restored who tried to tell us that the IRA had no involvement in Robert McCartney&#8217;s murder and that it was an unfortunate example of knife culture. They were in complete denial. We also had the denial of the IRA&#8217;s involvement in Paul Quinn&#8217;s murder, as well as all the other denials. Let us recognise that there are issues. We hope that such issues and concerns do not arise again, but we cannot pretend that they will not; otherwise, why would we be passing the Bill in the first place? Why would we be having these pledges and undertakings if we thought the issues had disappeared?</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/30">Our amendment 11 to clause 7 would require the pledge of office to be taken orally in front of the Assembly by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, as was the original intention when we negotiated and wrote the agreement. It was intended that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, who were then to be elected jointly by the Assembly, would take the pledge of office together. That was why some parties supported the concept of the pledge of office&#8212;they liked what might be called the constitutional liturgy of their taking a joint pledge of office that referred unambiguously to serving all the people of Northern Ireland equally, along with the other principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/31">It was for some other convenience&#8212;more a bureaucratic or procedural convenience&#8212;that a version was drawn up with words that allowed the First Minister and Deputy First Minister simply to affirm the terms of the pledge of office, as in the 1998 Act. I see no reason why there should not be a wider commitment. It would be more helpful, particularly given that we keep adding terms to the pledge of office. It would do no harm if they were actually vocalised. If that happened, people might remember and register them more and have more input.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/32">The amendments to clause 8 take up parallel issues to those raised in our amendments to clause 7. They address and try to resolve the inconsistencies between the wording of different parts of the undertaking, not least between the sixth part and some of the other parts. Consistent with the whole community approach, we have tried to extend the wording so that the under- taking applies not just to working together with other Assembly Members but to working with others. Assembly Members need to work with councillors, MPs and other representatives in the community if we are serious about confronting paramilitarism, working together and supporting those making a transition. The idea that that falls to Assembly Members alone is nonsense. Again, our amendments are consistent with what we have said.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/33">It is a bit much for the Minister to say, &#8220;We cannot have any amendments, because there was a consensus in the Fresh Start negotiations&#8221;. There was not a consensus for what we have ended up with in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. He tells us that something on which there was no consensus was agreed as though there was a consensus. We are trying to fill in gaps that even DUP Members, who support the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, now see in the Bill. Perhaps the Bill does need to be improved. There is a consensus on these Benches that remedial work is needed, but still the Minister waves his hands and says, &#8220;No, there is no consensus for it&#8221;, while ignoring the consensus emerging on at least some of these points.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/34">Our amendment 17 would provide for the Assembly Commissioner for Standards to be the point of reference for complaints about the undertaking and allow the commissioner, if they want, to appoint somebody with particular experience to deal with complaints and to use the facility of the pledge adjudicator, as appointed by the Commissioner for Complaints. If there were complaints about the undertaking or the pledge, there would probably be parallel or rival complaints, and this facility would allow that to be taken care of and avoid separate and rival investigations into issues deemed to be relevant or paired.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/35">That would help us to go forward. It is about making good the gap that the hon. Member for East Antrim talked about when he intervened on the hon. Member for North Down. There is no way of ensuring a standard of adherence to the undertaking, no way of investigating breaches, nowhere to take a complaint or anything else. That is where I have some difficulty with the proposal made by the hon. Member for North Down that the answer lies in Standing Orders. If there is a Division, I will support her proposal purely to show the deficiency of the Bill and the clause, but I do not believe that the answer lies in Standing Orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.494.1/36">Standing Orders are about the conduct of business and proceedings in the House. They are not normally about investigating things that have happened outside the House or allegations of various activities or consorting with people engaged in various activities. I am not sure that dealing with investigations and sanctions is normally the stuff of Standing Orders, so I do not think that the proposal best answers the issue. That is why we have tried to answer it differently in our amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.498.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, where Standing Orders set standards, the Assembly commissioner has something to work on, so if a complaint is made about whether someone has breached the pledge, there is at least a basis on which an investigation can take place?</p>

	<p pid="b.498.1/1">Yes, I fully accept that, and the clause says that Standing Orders will lay down provision on how the undertaking is made. That is why it was nonsensical of the Minister to argue that we should not set things down in the Assembly&#8217;s Standing Orders, when that is precisely what the clause will do. The hon. Member for East Antrim seems to assume that the Assembly Commissioner for Standards would deal with the complaint, so perhaps he sees merit in our amendment that would ensure that someone could receive, consider and assess a complaint. Certainly, the more that those standards are explicit either in the Bill or in Standing Orders, the better; that is fine.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/2">Of course the Assembly Commissioner for Standards does, among other things, address standards of public life. That is one reason why we have tabled amendment 15, to make it clear that the precepts and commitments in the undertaking would in effect be read alongside the Nolan principles, as part of the general standards of public life in Northern Ireland, so that MPs and councillors would be held to that standard. Let us remember that the commissioner deals with those issues separately and that we do not want to create inconsistencies where parties face allegations that their members said one thing at a council meeting and did something else as</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/3">MLAs and MPs. We would then get into all sorts of confusion about who is amenable to what standards. Let us create consistency and clarity of standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/4">In previous debates, Members have raised issues about what councillors from my party have done in different instances, and we have raised instances about what other people have said or done, or who they have consorted with in other situations. This is about trying to get us all beyond that and trying to ensure that everyone in all parties knows what standards are required of them and then adheres to those standards. That is why we have tabled that series of amendments to make good serious deficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/5">The other rich argument that came from the Minister was that he said that there should be no question of our trying to deal with breaches either of the undertaking or the pledge. In one instance, he said that, after all, the Assembly has the power to censure Ministers; but of course any attempt to censure Ministers on any grounds in the Assembly so far has ended up being vetoed under the petition of concern. He therefore points us to an alternative that is something of a dead end.</p>
	<p pid="b.498.1/6">If we are serious about trying to resolve these issues and about trying to ensure that no untoward incident triggers the sort of crisis that had the institutions teetering on the brink, as they were in the later part of last year, we need to do better than the Bill, and the Minister needs to do better than come up with humbug, shallow arguments about the degree of consensus about the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, when it is already clear, even from what has been said from these Benches, that everyone knows that that is very limited.</p>

	<p pid="b.499.0/1">I will try to be as quick as possible because we are trying to get through a lot. As a party, we fully support trying to move the Stormont House agreement forward and we support the principles in the Bill, and we totally abhor the paramilitaries, so we know where we are trying to go; but although we want to get there as quickly as possible, we have rushed this too quickly. We have two major problems that run through the amendment. The one that we have discussed at great length is the lack of sanctions, and the other is the lack of a definition of &#8220;paramilitaries&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/2">To answer the question that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24965" name="Nigel Mills">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> asked about other paramilitaries worldwide, when we go to the Falls Road, look at a wall there and see Basque and Colombian terrorists, Palestinians and others all being feted, we realise that this is larger than the sovereignty of this Parliament, and that this Parliament needs to use its sovereignty to do its best. We need to look at those matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/3">On sanctions, we fully support the very good amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>. We really do need sanctions, and that is absolutely the right way to deal with the issue. I have notes&#8212;I will not go into them&#8212;on some five breaches by Ministers in Stormont and another four by MLAs breaking the regulations. Although they were deemed to be breaches, there were no sanctions. We need sanctions in place in time. Therefore, if we pass the Bill today, how do we get the Standing Orders written in time, so that someone taking the pledge knows what the Standing Orders say? We need to be very quick; otherwise, this seems slightly pointless.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/4">We sympathise with most of the amendments on paramilitaries. We would like to see those amendments made, because there are other tensions, most of which I went through when I spoke on Second Reading, about how to define a paramilitary. We want our MLAs to be able to work and have influence on paramilitaries, without being seen as supporting them or being challenged from either side. Of course, within that are the flag issues and all sorts of other things, so I am very concerned about where we are going on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/5">I shall move on to an amendment that no one seems to have spoken about: the Government amendment that will get the Speaker to carry on in position. I find that slightly rich. We have a system where the Father of the House is normally the person who carries out that role and can do it perfectly well. The Government are arguing that we are sovereign but we must not impose things on the Assembly, but they are doing exactly that in trying to put the Speaker in charge. I would like to know more about why we are going down that route.</p>
	<p pid="b.499.0/6">We want to see the Bill work. We want to see things get better in Northern Ireland, and I think that hon. Members have probably heard enough from me.</p>

	<p pid="b.500.0/1">I will make a couple of brief remarks. I think the whole Committee wholeheartedly supports any effort to tackle paramilitarism. I think we would all agree that anyone who engages in or supports paramilitarism has no place in a democratic assembly, making and enforcing laws. I absolutely agree that all the sentiments in the oaths make sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/2">Where I get a little concerned is when we start talking about investigating and sanctioning breaches. We must be careful about exactly what some of these words could involve. What we have in these undertakings are not entirely pledges not to do things. They are pledges to do things, so we get phrases such as,</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/3">&#8220;to challenge all paramilitary activity and associated criminality&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/4">I could be accused of breaching that undertaking because I have not sufficiently challenged something. What does challenge mean? Does it mean that I should verbally dispute the validity of something? Should I say that paramilitary activity is heinous and I have therefore met that pledge, or should I be out on the streets of Belfast, physically challenging that activity where I see it?</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/5">Equally, MLAs will undertake,</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/6">&#8220;to challenge paramilitary attempts to control communities&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/7">and</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/8">&#8220;to work collectively with other members of the Assembly&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/9">I am not sure how we can have a sensible situation where someone is investigated because they have not quite worked collectively enough with other Members on something. Would that happen because they had been working independently, not collectively, and therefore that would not count, or because they had been working a bit collectively but not collectively enough? I am not sure how we go from an oath that sets out undertakings and beliefs to something that we could try to investigate and enforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.500.0/10">The Oath we take in this place is to be loyal to Her Majesty the Queen and her successors, but I do not think that Members get taken to the standards board because we have not quite been loyal enough to the Queen, or because something we have said has not been entirely consistent with the Oath. There is a separate code of conduct that we have to follow where the investigation of standards applies. We would not try to follow that from an oath. I am just not sure how the Members proposing the amendments could make the investigations and sanctions link to positive activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.501.0/1">First, we accept that if a pledge is made, there must be some way of measuring whether or not it has been lived up to. If it has not, there must be some way, by definition, of sanctioning someone for not doing so. Examples have been provided here today of how it is quite easy to work out whether or not someone has lived up to their pledge. If, for example, they make excuses for paramilitary activity or make excuses for people who have engaged in acts of violence, they are clearly not keeping to the pledge of office.</p>

	<p pid="b.501.1/1">I entirely agree. Where someone says or does something that clearly contravenes the undertakings they have given, we should be able to investigate it and sanctions should be available for it. My slight worry is that the amendments might allow a complaint to be made that somebody had not sufficiently challenged all paramilitary activity&#8212;that they had not said enough times how heinous such activity is, or they might not have taken any physical action in the community, for example. I am not sure how it can be proved or enforced when somebody has not done something. That is my point. If we wanted a code of conduct that could be followed, it would have to be clear that people were prohibited from speaking or acting in any way in support of paramilitaries.</p>

	<p pid="b.501.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if that were the case, the Assembly Commissioner, or whoever was making the adjudication, would be able to make a judgment about whether a complaint about the pledge of office was valid or not? It could be simply said, &#8220;Look, that is not what is meant by the pledge: it is not about the quantity; it is about whether someone should be condemned on the basis of support for paramilitary activity.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.501.3/1">I am sure that that could be said, but I am not sure whether that is set out in the amendments. We all know that such processes can be abused for partisan reasons, by people making scurrilous complaints that we know will never go anywhere, but which take up time and cause anxiety and spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.501.3/2">Let me provide a further example. There is another pledge to support those who are determined to make the transition away from paramilitarism. There could be a complaint that somebody had not given sufficient support to those who wanted to move away from paramilitary activity. That would be a nonsense, because there could be many reasons why an individual might not have given that degree of support in that situation. What kind of support are they meant to be providing as an individual MLA? I think we need to be cautious about moving from a set of extremely well-meaning and well-intentioned objectives, such as enforcing acceptable pledges and undertakings, and making them into a code of conduct that I believe we would struggle to enforce sensibly in this form.</p>

	<p pid="b.502.0/1">It all started so well when we started to debate this group. The Minister&#8217;s initial moves on timetabling were sensible and proportionate, and I believe would have been supported by the whole House. I think the key comments&#8212;these should be the leitmotif of this afternoon&#8217;s entire discussion&#8212;were about the creation of a society &#8220;free of paramilitarism&#8221;. That is the point we start from. That is where we want to go. It is the route to that desired state that we are discussing this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/2">We heard this afternoon a tour de force from <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>. Sometimes I gain the impression that hers is a multi-Member constituency, because it seems almost impossible that one person could sway the Committee so effectively&#8212;and not for the first time, either. I hope that the hon. Lady will allow me, on behalf of my colleagues and, I am sure, all of us, to say what an immensely impressive case she made.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/3">Come what may, the Government have to reflect and consult and reconsider. We have heard too much evidence this afternoon for us simply to allow this matter to slide through. We have heard some immense detail. The hon. Member for North Down talked about the conflicts that arose during her ministerial period. This provides yet another reason why we need to examine the case somewhat further.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> described to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Down as sensible and prudent, while also touching on a vital point. The right hon. Gentleman talked about public confidence, which I believe is very much at the heart of the matter. We can argue about the niceties, about interpretation and about angels dancing on the head of a pin. We can go through this catechism and ask whether people adhere to this precisely or not, but ultimately, the issue of public confidence is immensely important. There cannot be an area in the politics and daily life of Northern Ireland where there is a greater need for public confidence than in the transition away from paramilitarism and violence towards the desired state that I referred to earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/5">The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley also talked about identifying an ambivalence in attitude, and that feeds into some of the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24965" name="Nigel Mills">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase>. There is a need for further finessing and interpretation. When <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> went through the clauses of the Bill in detail, he put his finger on the fact that we are still not entirely clear about what many of them mean. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase> also referred to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.502.0/6">On behalf of my colleagues on the Opposition side of the Chamber, I call on the Government to take cognisance of the strength, the power and the logic of the arguments that they have heard on the Floor of the House today, not just because of the strength of those arguments but because of the impact that the proposals will have on civic life in Northern Ireland. What has been said today cannot be unsaid, and what has been done cannot be undone. We have to recognise the impact of what we have heard this afternoon. The Government have our entire support in this transition towards a good society and, as the SDLP put it when we debated an earlier amendment, a wholesome society.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.2/1">I have to register my deep disappointment in Her Majesty&#8217;s official Opposition; I had expected better of them this afternoon. This is a very important debate for the people of Northern Ireland, who have had to live with paramilitary activity for so long. We would have it called terrorism, but we now define it as paramilitary activity. There is no difference between those people, however; they are terrorists by another name. I am deeply disappointed, and I would like the hon. Gentleman to explain the rationale for this decision by Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition. He gave the House some good reasons earlier, and there is consensus on these Benches, so will he tell us what legitimate justification he has for sitting on his hands? Forgive me for putting it like that, but that is effectively what he and his colleagues are going to do this afternoon, and it is quite disgraceful.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.3/1">I accept the lash that the hon. Lady applies, and to a certain extent I deserve it. However, the point that my colleagues and I would make is that we have to look at this matter further and in greater depth. More consultation needs to be done and more discussion needs to be heard. We have heard ambivalence on both sides of the House today, and questions have been asked about interpretation. It is essential that we get this right. Heaven knows, when the hon. Lady refers to living under terrorism, I know what she means but I can never precisely understand it because, thanks be to God, I have not experienced it myself. However, I have immense respect and admiration for those who have experienced it, and I hope that they will allow Labour Members to say that we have to get this right today.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.3/2">We have to discuss these matters further. If the Government are prepared to extend an olive branch, to make an effort to consult more widely and to understand that this is not the best way forward, it will be appropriate for us neither to support nor to oppose them on this matter. I am sorry if I appear to be sitting on my hands. I apologise profoundly to those people who have been making the right points, but I hope they will understand that what we have heard today is not entirely a Manichaean argument. There have been many areas of interpretation, and it is there that we need to go. We need to get this right. This is not a binary choice. This is something that has to be discussed further.</p>

	<p pid="b.503.4/1">I shall be short, sharp and to the point. I have listened to the contributions today, and feel that I must take Members back to what the Bill is about,</p>
	<p pid="b.503.4/2">which is to enable the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement to be implemented in law. That is the basis on which we must draw the line of consensus. I have heard the arguments of the SDLP that the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement was not really a consensus&#8212;that actually no one was massively behind it.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.4/3">The fact is that the consensus was achieved after dozens and dozens of meetings throughout the autumn between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the other parties of Northern Ireland. That was the starting point.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.4/4">In relation to this group of amendments, I have to refer hon. Members to paragraphs 2.6 and 2.7 of section A of the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, which is where the consensus was arrived at to allow us even to venture into changing the Standing Orders of the Northern Ireland Assembly for the purpose of amending the taking of the oath. That is as far as the consensus allows us to go; we cannot go beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.4/5"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase> has been clear about her frustration over whether the Assembly will make Standing Orders to deal with breaches of the oath and of any other areas around paramilitarism. More than anyone else on the Government Benches, I understand the dangers of the paramilitaries, and am very, very keen to rub them out of history in Northern Ireland, but the fact is that the Northern Ireland Assembly set their Standing Orders to ensure that Members of the Legislative Assembly stick to their pledge and, should they not do so, to take a range of sanctions against them. That is in 69B of the Standing Orders. It is very important, therefore, that we say that it is for the Northern Ireland Assembly to set out their procedures to deal with those matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.503.4/6">I understand the frustrations that have been expressed &#8212;we have listened to them&#8212;but that does not detract from the very important issue that our consensus starts and finishes with the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement and, as it is specified, we cannot go beyond that.

	<p pid="b.507.1/1">The Government have included clause 9 in the Bill in the name of transparency. I am certainly all for transparency in Budgets, be it here or in the Assembly, and I say that as a former Minister of Finance and Personnel in the Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/2">Amendment 18 would make the transparency more articulate when the Minister of Finance lays a new statement before the Assembly to reflect the sum allocated to the Executive under the Barnett formula. It should not be just about a figure; it should explain how the figure was reached and the formula that was used to arrive at it.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/3">The amendment is also about making good concerns expressed by parties not just in Northern Ireland but in other devolved areas that legislation passed in this House that conditions the overall plans in the Budget has consequential impacts on the Barnett formula. The Government deny that that is so. Many of us in the devolved parties believe that it is so. The best way of knowing is exactly by having the sort of transparency that amendment 18 would provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.507.1/4">The transparency is also about avoiding the confusion around Budget announcements. Sometimes the Chancellor will talk about money that is available to Northern Ireland going directly to the Executive under the Barnett formula. Other times money will come from UK-wide funds or it is challenge funds that Northern Ireland is eligible for. Other money is also allocated to Northern Ireland on a purely ring-fenced basis. Often there is confusion about the different sums. Hon. Members are confused when we ask questions during Budget procedures. Members of the Assembly are confused and of course, the public, whose money we are talking about, are completely confused. So if there are to be benefits to transparency, let us make sure that the transparency is complete and articulate. That is what amendment 18 is about.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-10b.508.0" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11668" speakername="Ben Wallace" colnum="508"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160310/debtext/160310-0003.htm#160310-0003.htm_spnew37">
	<p pid="b.508.0/1">Clause 9 delivers the commitment, set out in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, that the Government would legislate to promote increased transparency in the setting of Executive budgets. The clause amends section 64 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. It requires the Northern Ireland Finance Minister to lay a statement in the Assembly specifying the amount of UK Government funding available for the financial year, as calculated by the Treasury and notified by the Secretary of State. The Finance Minister&#8217;s statement must be laid at least 14 days in advance of the introduction of a draft Executive budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/2">Upon laying the draft budget, the clause also requires that the Finance Minister issues a further statement showing that the amount of Government funding required by the draft budget does not exceed that specified by the Secretary of State. The clause also makes provision for a similar process to be followed if there is any change in the level of Government funding provided to the Executive. If this occurs, the Secretary of State can notify the Finance Minister of the change in funding. Within four months, the Finance Minister must inform the Assembly of this notification and specify the revisions to expenditure proposals required as a result of the Secretary of State&#8217;s notification. In providing for greater transparency around Executive finances, this clause will encourage affordable and sustainable budgets going forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/3">I do have some sympathy with the aim of amendment 18, which is to bring about further transparency in the budgetary process&#8212;that is what I think clause 9 already achieves. I understand there to be two main purposes behind the amendment to the provisions in the Bill which deal with the draft Budgets presented to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/4">To deal with subsections (a) and (b) in the amendment, the inner workings of the Barnett formula are sometimes unfairly characterised as opaque. In fact all of the information which underlies the calculations and therefore the calculation of the block grant is set out in the Treasury publication known as the &#8220;Statement of Funding Policy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/5">As will once again be evident when the Chancellor presents his Budget next week, the Barnett consequentials for Northern Ireland relating to funding decisions taken by the Treasury will be communicated to the Northern Ireland Executive almost instantly upon the Chancellor taking his seat. It is the intention behind the provisions in this Bill to make it possible for Assembly Members&#8212;and parliamentarians in this House who take an interest&#8212; to more easily work out what is going on under the surface to deliver the Executive&#8217;s budgetary allocations from the Treasury. I want to reassure hon. Members that the Northern Ireland Office is working closely with the Treasury and the relevant Northern Ireland Departments to determine the format of the new statement that the Finance Minister will be obliged to lay in the Assembly. The statement will necessarily include information on the application of the Barnett formula and its outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/6">We do not believe the provisions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amendment will achieve the aims intended, or that they are necessary. In fact, a statement which simply said that &#8220;the amount of UK funding included in this statement was calculated by the Treasury with reference to the statement of funding policy&#8221; would be technically compliant with the amendment. I do not believe that that is the intent. I ask hon. Members to take it that we will ensure that the statements, when made, are more informative on a voluntary basis than such legislation would compel them to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/7">Paragraph (c) of the amendment is of a rather different character, and the Government cannot accept the logic behind it. Indeed, matters related to this subject were debated at some length when the House considered the proposals for English votes for English laws. It is not possible to calculate changes to the block grants on a Bill-by-Bill basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/8">The block grant allocations to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly are calculated at spending reviews and adjusted following decisions taken at fiscal events such as Budgets or autumn statements on overall Whitehall departmental budgets. Approval from Parliament to pay funds into the respective devolved Consolidated Funds is granted through the Supply estimates process&#8212;itself not subject to EVEL.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/9">Even when a Bill&#8217;s impact assessment identifies extra spending or savings, implicitly or explicitly through a money resolution, in many cases this decision may not impact on the size of the block grant at all. So the intent which I understand to be behind the amendment would have no practical effect. The relevant part of the Finance Minister&#8217;s statement would say, every time he or she made it, that no effects of the type specified in the legislation has been identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/10">In relation to paragraph (d) of the amendment, there is no reason why the statement to be made by the Finance Minister should not clarify any elements of ring-fenced funding being made available to the Executive. However, given the reservations that I explained earlier about the need to prescribe every aspect in legislation, I ask again that hon. Members accept that we will work closely with the Finance Minister to ensure that sufficient detail is made available to permit proper scrutiny and understanding of the various funding sources available to the Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/11">On paragraphs (e) and (f) of the amendment, I am afraid that we are unclear precisely what is intended by the proposed provisions. The Executive&#8217;s block grant does not generally include non-devolved elements of funding, and the charter for budget responsibility sets out obligations for the UK Government, not for the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/12">Finally, much of what is provided for in the final proposed subsection, which would require the Finance Minister to lay &#8220;further timely statements&#8221;, is already achieved by the existing provisions. New subsection 64(1C) to (1E) will compel the Finance Minister to lay new statements to the Assembly under certain circumstances if notified of changes to the level of UK funding available. The new statements will not, however, be any more able to deal with the questions of changes provoked by legislative provision at Westminster than as explained previously in relation to English votes for English laws.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/13">I urge hon. Members to withdraw their amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.508.0/14" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move that clause 9 stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.510.0/1">I am not persuaded by any of the Minister&#8217;s arguments in respect of the quality of the amendment, but I can assure him that I will not press it to a Division.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.0/2">The Minister said he was not sure that paragraphs (e) and (f) were needed. Paragraph (e) relates to the Chancellor&#8217;s own statement. Often there is confusion about whether the money made available to Northern Ireland is in the Northern Ireland budget or not. The aim was to ensure greater clarity for Members in this House, Members of the Assembly and the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.0/3">Paragraph (f) refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.510.0/4">&#8220;the impact of any relevant implications for Northern Ireland arising from the Charter for Budget Responsibility.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.510.0/5">The charter for budget responsibility is becoming increasingly important. Like other measures, it was probably bubble-wrapped as a neutral budgetary tool originally, but neutral budgetary tools end up being cuts weapons in the hands of the Treasury. The aim of the amendment was to ensure that that is understood. Let us remember that the welfare cap is part of the charter for budget responsibility. We want to ensure three-dimensional transparency in relation to budgetary matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.510.0/6">I am glad that there are some aspects of the amendment the Minister would want to see reflected in the further outworkings of clause 9 and that he feels confident they will be. I do not share that confidence, but I will not tax the House with a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.513.0/1">The next group covers general provisions and new clauses. Clause 10 provides for the parliamentary procedure to be used for the regulation-making powers in the Bill, while clause 11 provides for the short title, commencement and extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/2">Amendment 2 is consequential to new clauses 1 and 2, which I will speak to in a moment. The amendment would change the commencement provisions so that those new clauses would come into force at Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/3">New clause 1, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase>, concerns the definition of a victim in relation to the role of the Commission for Victims and Survivors. When it comes to the past, it is clear that victims should be our first priority. I am aware that the definition of a victim is a matter of contention.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/4">The legislation that currently deals with the concept of a victim in the context of legacy matters in Northern Ireland is for the purposes of the Commission for Victims and Survivors. The Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 was passed by the previous Labour Government. This is now a devolved matter and therefore the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Accordingly, the Commission for Victims and Survivors is the responsibility of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/5">Under the order, &#8220;victim and survivor&#8221; means a person appearing to the commission to be a person who was physically or psychologically injured as a result of a conflict-related incident, who regularly provides substantial care for such a person, or who is bereaved as a result of a conflict-related incident. It includes persons who are psychologically injured as a result of being a witness to an incident or of providing medical or emergency assistance to a person in connection with an incident.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/6">Under that definition, it is possible for someone who was a perpetrator of violence, or a member of their family or their carer, to be defined as a victim, and to benefit from the commission&#8217;s assistance. We believe that there is a clear distinction between innocent victims and perpetrators, just as we have stated that we will never accept equivalence between those who sought to defend democracy and those who attempted to destroy it.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/7">Members of the House will be aware of the significant progress made on legacy issues during the Stormont House talks towards the end of 2014. That included the Northern Ireland Executive agreeing to the recommendation from the Commission for Victims and Survivors of a new mental trauma service better to meet needs in that area. Advocate-counsellor assistance was also agreed for victims and survivors, to provide support and to help individuals to access relevant services.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/8">I know that the definition remains highly controversial with not only the Northern Ireland parties, but many people in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. In my recent discussions, it has been very much a live concern for the parties, but it did not form any substantive part of the two rounds of talks that led to the Stormont House and &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreements.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/9">As a devolved matter, any change to the definition would require cross-community support in the Assembly, and I am sure Members will agree that the matter is best resolved by the political parties in Northern Ireland. The establishment of the institutions agreed under the Stormont House agreement still represents the best chance of making progress on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/10">New clause 5 relates to members of the armed forces, victims and survivors. I do not think I need to clarify further for colleagues my empathy and respect for members of our armed forces. I welcome the support that the DUP and others are evidencing by raising these issues today. It is vital that they know their interests are represented here and at Stormont.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/11">The dedication, professionalism and courage of the armed forces were key factors that ensured that terrorism did not succeed during the troubles. More than 1,000 members of the security forces lost their lives during Operation Banner, securing and maintaining the rule of law in Northern Ireland. Without those sacrifices, and those of a great many others who served in the armed forces during the troubles, the peace process would simply not have succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/12">Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 is about promoting equality of opportunity, and the need to ensure people are not disadvantaged. I have made it a priority in my time as Minister to listen and respond to the concerns of serving and retired members of our armed forces. They are concerned about a rewriting of the past and about a one-sided approach to resolving legacy issues. They are concerned that there should never be a repetition of the circumstances that occurred during the troubles.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/13">There has been no indication that former or serving servicemen and women have been adversely affected by section 75, so the Government do not think it is right to alter it.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/14">The Government cannot support the proposal becoming law. We would not want the status of members of the armed forces in Northern Ireland to become the subject of political controversy, and the measure would give rise to a real risk of creating difficulties where none currently exist. The best way to deal with the concerns that members of the armed forces have raised with me is for all parties to deliver on the commitments in the Stormont House agreement. That includes a historical investigations unit, which will address the perceived one-sided nature of the status quo by investigating all outstanding troubles-related deaths, in chronological order, unless there is a good reason not to do so. It includes the commitment by the Northern Ireland Executive to explore the idea of a victims&#8217; pension. Many former servicemen and women feel that they are the forgotten victims of the troubles, and that provides an appropriate recognition of their status.</p>
	<p pid="b.513.0/15">The commitments also include improved support services for those defined as victims, who often suffer from mental trauma. I was delighted to learn this week that Combat Stress has been awarded a grant of &#163;500,000 from LIBOR funding to roll out mental health services in Northern Ireland and to make sure that those service personnel who may feel that they are not being prioritised or receiving the service they deserve do in fact get that delivered. I have pushed for that since I was first appointed and I am delighted that we can now, I hope, improve their lot.</p>

	<p pid="b.515.2/1">I am pleased that Combat Stress has been allocated money, but many other organisations in Northern Ireland, including Beyond the Battlefield, SSAFA and regimental associations, do good work with veterans and former personnel. How can they take part in the process and access some of the LIBOR funding that has been set aside for one specific organisation?</p>

	<p pid="b.515.3/1">People can access a range of veterans organisations, including regimental associations and the Royal British Legion, as well as the Government themselves through the Ministry of Defence and Veterans UK, and I encourage them to do so. Perhaps I should declare an interest: I lost 30% of my sight while serving in East Tyrone on a tour of Northern Ireland in 1994, so perhaps I will be covered by the definition of a victim. It is important that we help the victims and recognise that they are not equated with the terrorists and those who sought to spread murder and chaos.</p>
	<p pid="b.515.3/2">I am afraid that the Government will oppose the measures that have been tabled, but we call on Members to continue to work with us on resolving the legacy issues. As well as people&#8217;s physical suffering, we must consider their mental health and how they deal with memories of the past. This is about not only drawing a line under what has happened, but allowing people to know as much as possible about what happened to their loved ones or, indeed, themselves. The narrative of,</p>
	<p pid="b.515.3/3">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the terrorists fault,&#8221; that is being pushed has the negative effect of preying on people&#8217;s bereavement by trying to come up with a ready excuse that it was not actually the terrorists who killed their husband or wife, but somebody else all along. That preys on people&#8217;s fears and their real pain, and those who seek to do that should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.516.0/1">I hear what the Minister says about the definition of a victim being a matter for the Northern Ireland legislature, but does he agree that the definition is unfair in its present form, in which a perpetrator of violence is equated with those throughout society who were badly harmed, murdered and maimed?</p>

	<p pid="b.516.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is totally wrong to equate the two. I believe that the remedy for that is in the Northern Ireland Assembly, which is where the power to amend the definition of victims lies. I urge the Assembly always to keep at the forefront of its mind the fact that the two are not the same, because that will go further than us, as a Government, imposing that change.</p>

	<p pid="b.516.2/1">I beg to differ with the Minister about this. Many victims and survivors who were affected by the troubles in Northern Ireland neither reside in nor came from Northern Ireland; in fact, they may even be the Minister&#8217;s constituents. Given that hundreds of soldiers who were injured or killed in Northern Ireland came from Great Britain, that police officers came from Great Britain and that civilians were injured in Great Britain in acts of terrorism committed in connection with the troubles, to suggest that the definition of victim and survivor is a matter to be dealt with by the Northern Ireland Assembly misses the point. Victims and survivors came from all over the United Kingdom, so it is for this Parliament to determine who is a victim and survivor.</p>

	<p pid="b.516.3/1">I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, and I do not disagree with a large part of it, but the Bill deals with the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement&#8212;the Stormont House agreement&#8212;in so far as it applies in Northern Ireland. I am sure that there will be further opportunities to redefine &#8220;victims&#8221; as that term would apply in the United Kingdom. Under the previous Government, the Ministry of Justice did a lot of work to ensure that the criminal injuries compensation scheme did not extend to burglars, robbers and everyone else who had managed to claim against it when they had perpetrated a crime. Precedents in United Kingdom law, or certainly in English and Welsh law, make that difference clear. I hear loud and clear what the right hon. Gentleman says, and I hope that there will be opportunities to address that in future legislation, but today we are considering this Bill, which is a consequence of the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/2">New clause 4 would establish the implementation and reconciliation group, which is one of four new bodies to be established as part of the Stormont House agreement. The others are, as we had hoped, the historical investigations unit, the independent commission on information retrieval and the oral history archive. Members will be aware that the Government continue to support the establishment of all those bodies and the other measures in the Stormont House agreement. However, for reasons that</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/3">I will set out, we do not agree that it would be a positive step to move ahead with the IRG in the absence of the other bodies and measures. The IRG and the other measures to deal with Northern Ireland&#8217;s past require cross-community support in Northern Ireland and must be dealt with as part of the package of bodies and measures proposed in the Stormont House agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/4">As I have mentioned, the IRG is an integral part of the four bodies proposed in the Stormont House agreement. The Government have committed &#163;150 million towards the establishment of those bodies as part of our commitment to help Northern Ireland to deal with its troubled past. The design and implementation of the bodies was considered as part of the intense negotiations during the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; legacy talks, but the establishment of the IRG and the other legacy mechanisms could not be agreed at the time. The Government continue to work on making progress on the legacy strand of those negotiations. As is set out in the Stormont House agreement, the Government support much of what was proposed. The IRG should receive and commission reports; it should promote reconciliation; it should be appointed by Northern Irish political parties, the UK Government and the Irish Government; and it should have a chair of international standing who is nominated jointly by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/5">As Members know, there have been a number of previous initiatives aimed at addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland&#8217;s troubled past, and they have all recognised that it cannot be reduced to a one-dimensional issue. No single approach or solution will work in isolation; a concerted and multifaceted approach is required. The Stormont House agreement makes it clear that the four legacy bodies are intended to constitute a package of measures to deal with the past, each addressing a different dimension of this difficult issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/6">I suggest that establishing the IRG on its own would not ultimately promote reconciliation, although that is a key function of the body. I say that because the proposed new clause ignores many of the ingredients acknowledged by the political parties in Northern Ireland as integral to dealing with Northern Ireland&#8217;s past. Those ingredients must address the suffering of victims and survivors, facilitate the pursuit of justice and information recovery, and be balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/7">A significant criticism that victims have raised with us regarding the current approach is the piecemeal nature of how legacy matters are dealt with. I do not think that we wish to perpetuate that through a piecemeal implementation of the legacy institutions. The IRG, as an integral part of the Stormont House agreement, can realistically be implemented only in parallel with the other legacy bodies, and it is clear that progress on the whole package of legacy mechanisms must have cross-community support in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/8">I recognise the views of UUP and SDLP Members about new clauses 2 and 3. Indeed, I sympathise with the sentiment behind the measures. On the face of it, reverting to the pre-St. Andrews agreement method of electing the First and Deputy First Ministers might be a welcome change, because that involved an overt demonstration of cross-community support. However, to accept the new clauses would be to turn back the clock to before the St Andrews agreement and the subsequent legislation, which is the basis on which devolved government was restored in 2007 and continues to this day. The reality is that such changes would need to be supported on a cross-community basis, but that has not happened. The purpose of the Bill is to implement the Government&#8217;s commitments under the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, and the proposals go beyond that agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/9">I am concerned that if we made changes to the institutions without cross- community support in Northern Ireland, we would risk destabilising the political process in Northern Ireland, damaging the substantial progress that we have made and diverting attention from the challenges and opportunities that Northern Ireland faces. Our priority in supporting devolved politics in Northern Ireland must be to implement the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; and Stormont House agreements, and we are taking another step towards that with this Bill. I recognise that this matter has been considered in the past. The same amendment was tabled in the other place during the passage of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in early 2014, but the Government could not support it then. I am afraid that, for the same reason, we will not do so today.</p>
	<p pid="b.516.3/10">I have outlined the reasons why the Government will not support new clauses 1 to 5 and amendment 2, and I urge hon. Members not to press them to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="b.519.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I thank all right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed to this debate and on Second Reading, as well as Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive who have engaged with me and my officials on the detail of the Bill&#8217;s preparation. I extend my thanks to Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition for their support for the Bill, and for agreeing to its faster than usual passage through the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/3">As we have heard, the Bill gives effect to key elements of the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement of 2015 and the Stormont House agreement of 2014, which were agreed between the UK Government, parties representing a majority of Unionists and nationalists in the Executive, and the Irish Government. Building on important progress that has already been made on implementing a range of aspects of those agreements, the Bill marks an important step towards a more peaceful, prosperous and stable Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/4">As we have heard, a crucial part of the Bill is to put into effect a treaty to be agreed between the UK and Irish Governments that will establish the independent reporting commission, which we see as a crucial step on the road to the day when paramilitarism in Northern Ireland is entirely something of the past, rather than the present. The commission will promote and report on progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland, and all the pain and distress that it has caused in the past, and sadly sometimes continues to cause today.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/5">In Committee we introduced a small amendment to make it clear that the Government will not issue guidance on national security matters in another jurisdiction, and I am grateful to the Committee for adopting that amendment. We considered a set of amendments on the process for appointing members of the independent reporting commission, and for a moment I had a bit of a flashback to the debate on appointments that took place at great length over the 10 weeks of talks that led to the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. We have listened carefully to what hon. Members have had to say, and we feel that an appointment by the office of the First and Deputy First Minister sensibly reflects the content of the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. It involves the need to establish consensus between the First and Deputy First Minister, and we encourage them to consult their Executive colleagues on such matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/6">I reiterate the Government&#8217;s commitment to placing a draft treaty relating to the new commission in the Library of the House as soon as possible, and certainly at the same time or before any regulations are placed before the House regarding the commission. As the Minister stated, any guidance would be published by us before the commission starts its work.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/7">We also had a lively debate on the proposed amendments to the pledge of office for Ministers, and the undertaking for Members of the Legislative Assembly. Both of those reflect commitments in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement to give unequivocal support to the rule of law and to work collectively to achieve a society free of paramilitarism. It is good that the House has had today the opportunity to reiterate our strong commitment to those goals. These commitments contained in the Bill take Northern Ireland&#8217;s political parties further than ever before in their determination to see a complete end to paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I believe the provisions represent an important step forward. We had a substantial and informed debate about how MLAs could best be held to account for upholding that new undertaking. We carefully considered the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10958" name="Sylvia Hermon">the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)</phrase>, but I remain clear that this is a matter not for this House but for the Assembly. It is crucial that we do all we can to ensure that those who make these undertakings are kept to those commitments, but these are matters for the Assembly and I am sure it will take note of the points made today.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/8">It is also important that we recognise that the extension of the appointment period for Ministers is a helpful way to improve the way devolution works. This was, I gather, originally an idea put forward by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase> and it became part of the Stormont House agreement, and I think it will play a part in contributing to the compilation of a more bipartisan programme for government, as there will be more time to conclude that before people take on their ministerial responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/9">I am delighted that the House has accepted the financial transparency clause, which I see as an important part of the Bill. A considerable amount of work was needed to ensure that we came up with a clause that not only worked but fully respected the decisions of the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to their own budget. Thanks to the helpful contributions made by the Department of Finance and Personnel, Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury and the Northern Ireland Office, we have a sensible provision that will add transparency and workability to the way the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly compile their budgets. That, too, is an important step forward, and it demonstrates that we are learning the lessons of the experience of recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/10">During the debate in Committee earlier, the Minister reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to the establishment of the bodies designed to address the legacy of Northern Ireland&#8217;s past. It is of course a matter of regret that we cannot include them in this legislation, but the reality is that we do not yet have the commitments that we need, on a cross-community basis, and the consensus that we need to be able to bring forward such legislation. We do recognise the importance of establishing these bodies, and I assure the House that we will continue with our efforts to build the consensus that we need to introduce them. We made real progress during the talks which led to the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, but sadly it was not quite enough to enable us to proceed with this legislation. I will continue my programme of engagement with the political parties and with victims groups to try to bridge those final gaps and thus enable us to get these bodies up and running. We believe that they would deliver considerably better outcomes for victims and survivors, and would represent the best way forward for seeking to address some of the painful legacies of the past and the troubles.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/11">I also take on board the points made in the amendments and in the debate about the definition of a &#8220;victim&#8221;. As a Government, we sympathise with many of the points that have been made on these matters. We can see real problems with the definition, which includes those injured at their own hands in the course of the commission of criminal acts, but this is properly a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide, not for this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.519.2/12">In conclusion, the Bill will be a step forward for Northern Ireland. It will help us to deliver those crucial two agreements&#8212;&#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; and Stormont House. It will take us towards a more successful, stable and prosperous Northern Ireland. Most important of all, it will take us a step closer to a Northern Ireland that is, once and for all, free from the pernicious influence of paramilitaries and terrorists of any sort. I ask hon. Members to support the Bill on its Third Reading.</p>

	<p pid="b.521.0/1">We welcome the passage of the Bill. We are a signatory, as it were, to the Stormont agreement. We want to see its implementation. Equally, we want to see the implementation of the Stormont</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/2">House agreement. I echo the sentiments of the Secretary of State, particularly in relation to the bodies that will deal with the legacy issues&#8212;the historical investigations unit being prime among them.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/3">Every day, I talk to constituents, victims and survivors in Northern Ireland. There is a deep sense of frustration on their part that the media are full of the whingeing of Sinn F&#233;in about what the state did and what the Government did. The stark statistics speak for themselves: 90% of the killings carried out in what we call the &#8220;troubles&#8221; were carried by out terrorist organisations. Some 60% of those killings were carried out by republican terrorists. There are 3,000 unsolved murders linked to the troubles in Northern Ireland, yet we have the absurdity of scores of police officers reviewing the killings known as &#8220;Blood Sunday&#8221; in Londonderry and not a single police officer looking at the equally bloody Sunday in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13781" name="Tom Elliott">the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Tom Elliott)</phrase>, when the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb at the cenotaph and murdered many innocent people. Today, not a single police officer is being deployed to investigate those responsible for that murder.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/4">Looking at that situation, we can understand why ordinary people in Northern Ireland are left deeply frustrated. Ninety per cent. of killings get little or no attention, yet the focus is constantly on what the state did, constantly on what our brave soldiers did and constantly on what our brave police officers did. In many instances, the killings carried out by the state were entirely lawful and legitimate, and carried out against terrorists engaged in acts of violence and terrorism. They were often in self-defence.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/5">We have inquests. We have investigations. We have inquiries. We have hundreds of millions of pounds spent on investigating what the state did. The innocent victims are not only not getting the attention they deserve; they have to accept&#8212;they do not accept it; &#8220;endure&#8221; is perhaps the word&#8212;a definition of &#8220;victim&#8221; that in law equates them with the perpetrators. That is something this House ought to address. There is no consensus in Northern Ireland on the definition of &#8220;victim&#8221;, and I do not think the Northern Ireland Assembly is likely to agree one in the near future. There was debate on this in the Stormont House discussions and it has been discussed at length in the past. I presented a private Member&#8217;s Bill in this House to change the definitions of victim and survivor. I tabled amendments to the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. My party has tabled an amendment to this Bill, as has the Ulster Unionist party. We still do not have a change to the definition of victim and survivor.</p>
	<p pid="b.521.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10484" name="Steve Pound">The hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> is right to say that this matter goes beyond the people who live in Northern Ireland. It includes many who served in Northern Ireland, and the victims of the Birmingham, Manchester, Canary Wharf, Bishopsgate and Guildford bombings. There are many instances of terrorist atrocities carried out by republican terrorists here.</p>

	<p pid="b.522.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend believe that the injustice was further compounded earlier this week, when the Legal Aid Agency refused to support the just quest of the families of the Hyde Park bombing for civil support in their pursuit against John Downey?</p>

	<p pid="b.523.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The other day I was in the lift with Lord Tebbit and I asked after his wife. I think of the Brighton bomb&#8212;the Conservative party knows this all too well&#8212;which was a blow to the heart of British democracy if ever there was one. I think of Lord Tebbit&#8217;s wife. I think of others who died in that attempt by the Provisional IRA to blast British democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.523.0/2">As Lord Tebbit himself asked, why is the man who planted the bomb being equated with the victims of the Brighton bombing? With the greatest of respect to the Secretary of State and the Minister, I say that this is not a matter just for the Northern Ireland Assembly; it is a matter for every Member of this House of Commons. We all have constituents who served in Northern Ireland, and many of us have constituents who died or were injured there. They are all victims and survivors. The Minister himself would come under the category of &#8220;survivor&#8221;, yet he is equated with the very people whom he lawfully was seeking to bring to book and who were holding Northern Ireland to ransom.</p>
	<p pid="b.523.0/3">My final point concerns an amendment of ours that unfortunately was not debated this afternoon. I disagree with the Minister. The military covenant is not being fully implemented in Northern Ireland. I will send him copies of responses I have had from Departments in Northern Ireland specifically stating that constituents of mine who have undertaken military service cannot benefit from the military covenant because of section 75. I will share that correspondence with him so that he can see our frustration at hearing Ministers deny there is a problem. We, as Members representing constituencies in Northern Ireland, have constituents who served in our armed forces who are not getting the full benefit of the military covenant because of section 75. I hope he will understand our frustration.</p>

	<p pid="b.523.1/1">I share the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s frustration. That is why, when I was appointed, instead of waiting on areas like mental health, I went around the problem, approached Combat Stress and said, &#8220;What&#8217;s important to veterans and victims is outcomes and getting a service. I&#8217;m not too fussed who delivers it. I just want to get the service delivered to them.&#8221; I hope that is partly why we have got where we have with Combat Stress, but I am happy to listen to other areas of frustration and see what we can do to deliver the service.</p>

	<p pid="b.523.2/1">I entirely accept what the Minister has said. I have nothing but admiration for his efforts to ensure that veterans of our armed forces living in Northern Ireland receive the support they deserve. However, I have had constituents say to me, &#8220;I have returned to live in Northern Ireland, and the military covenant tells me that I should have access to medical care on the same basis as other residents of Northern Ireland, as if I had lived in Northern Ireland, but I don&#8217;t&#8221;. The covenant says not that there should be special advantages, but that veterans should not be disadvantaged by virtue of their service. In reality, veterans in Northern Ireland who return to Northern Ireland are being disadvantaged by their service. They go to the bottom of the waiting list, instead of being placed in the list where they would have been had they been ordinarily resident. That is what the military covenant should be doing for veterans, but it is not currently delivering. We will be happy to meet the Minister to discuss how we can overcome this difficulty and ensure that the military covenant delivers.</p>
	<p pid="b.523.2/2">We welcome and support the Bill and the Secretary of State&#8217;s ongoing efforts to conclude the other elements of the Stormont House agreement. We stand with her on issues such as national security, and we hope that we will see this matter through to a successful conclusion. We all owe it to the people of Northern Ireland to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.524.2/1">Following <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase>, I want to make it clear that my party has not set out to oppose the Bill, but in the talks we worked for a better and fuller agreement than we have ended up with in the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. We also wanted one that was more competent and more cogent, and we feel similarly in terms of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.2/2">In opening Third Reading, the Secretary of State talked about the purposes of the pledge and the undertaking and said they were unequivocal commitments, but contrary to what he said, the debate on the amendments showed that the pledge and the undertaking are actually going to prove equivocal, ineffective and inert. So they will not even be fit for the purpose for which they have been offered, and that is bad legislation on our part. We regret the fact that Ministers remain tied to the idea that the terms of the &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement are themselves somehow adequate when it comes to legislation. The fact is that Ministers are pretending that the tyre is only flat at the bottom when they try to say that this is sufficient. The fact is that there are clear difficulties; there are clear gaps. This will not be fit to meet any of the bumps and challenges that we are going to meet in the road ahead, and we can point to experience to prove that.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.2/3">On the new clauses that could not be fully debated, just as the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley has addressed new clause 5, which his party tabled, to answer some of what the Minister said, I want to make it clear that our aim was never to pre-empt the legislation that is necessary in relation to the past. That is why we would not have supported any amendment on the definition of victims or anything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.2/4">On trying to make provision to establish an implementation and reconciliation group, our new clause did not venture into any of the possible roles that that group might have in respect of the past. It did not trespass on any of the understandings or discussions so far, but it tried to offer what we offered in the talks, consistent with our advocacy of a whole-community approach to achieving a wholesome society and of having a tied-in approach by all the parties to taking responsibility for ending paramilitarism and overcoming sectarianism and for moving forward on flags, emblems and all those other issues that the agreement is meant to cover but that are not properly carried forward, unless people think that they are all just stuck in a sin bin to be parked at the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.2/5">One of the inadequacies of the latest version of the Stormont agreement is that too many of the issues that should have been the subject of cross-party approaches and commitments now end up named as Executive approaches and commitments at precisely a time when we are possibly looking at fewer parties being in the Executive. So the effort was made to get a cross-party agreement, but we end up with something that is expressed in the language of the Executive. We do not want a situation where parties not in the Executive in future can disown their leadership responsibilities on these key issues and somehow make a prosecution case against the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister or the parties that occupy that office for the failure to deliver on principles and precepts to which we were all meant to be setting our hand in the Stormont House talks and, indeed, the Haass talks before then.</p>
	<p pid="b.524.2/6">Some of us have tried to offer broader bandwidth to the implementation and reconciliation group because we want a bigger, better, fuller and more meaningful agreement. We really do fear that some of the parties that support the limited terms of the agreement will be the very people who complain about its inadequacy, as we have heard today. More has been said on some of the issues today than I heard said in our negotiations during the weeks and weeks at Stormont House. It is really is a bit much when parties use this place to table amendments to try to show their difference but condemn the rest of us whenever we are consistent with our arguments in the talks. We are being absolutely consistent with those arguments in our amendments today, and in telling the Government to listen to everything that they have heard in the debate and everything that they will hear beyond it and to try to ensure that we have something that is broader, more sufficient and fit for purpose.</p>

	<p pid="b.525.0/1">I will be very brief, but I want to get one message across that I think we all forget: the people of Northern Ireland want to move on and all the parties here want everyone to move on. We want to get the legacy issues sorted out; we want to get somewhere, so I am really disappointed today that we have listened to good arguments on a lot of good amendments but just had a blanket no. The Government could find ways in the Lords to amend the Bill to make it better and still make it work in Stormont. We have something that will not do what is written on the paper. It will fail. I want it to work and we will try our hardest to make it work, but we have really missed an opportunity today.</p>
	<p pid="b.525.0/2">I served in Belfast in 1983, and losing one soldier from the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, when we thought we had managed to get through on a blood-free trip, if I may put it that way, is difficult to this day. I am proud to have served there, as are many more, but I feel that we have not moved ourselves on today; we have not taken the opportunities that we could have. I want to see us continue to make progress; I want to see things work.</p>
	<p pid="b.525.0/3">I am concerned about the section 75 idea, because in my view it makes the military look as if we are a minority. The military should always be part of all society: it is not a minority; it reflects all angles. I do not think we have followed the right course there. We need to find a new definition of victims and we need to reflect on how to choose the First Minister and Deputy First Minister into the future. We cannot just keep ducking everything.

	<p pid="b.526.0/1">I rise to speak on Third Reading of a Bill that basically addressed the independent reporting commission, the pledge, the budget and, through our various amendments relating to joint Ministers, the election. We have sought through Second Reading, through Committee and on Report to ensure that the Bill was strengthened, made more meaningful and made more robust. I hope only that the Government have listened and will bring forward appropriate amendments in the other place to deal with these particular issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.0/2">So far, I have not yet heard from the Secretary of State. Perhaps she will drop me a line to say how much money will be made available to the National Crime Agency and to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, when that money will be released and what will be the split between the NCA and the PSNI, particularly in relation to the Independent Reporting Commission.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.0/3">We tried to raise national security issues on Second Reading, and paramilitarism and criminality are to be addressed, but the Government have invoked and can invoke through this legislation national security, which means the protection of agents. That can impede the very work that we are trying to do. It also means both the Government and the paramilitaries will never be willing to ensure that the full truth about many of those issues is brought to light.</p>

	<p pid="b.526.2/1">What we are saying, or what I am saying, is that there should be full disclosure of information to ensure that all those who were, shall we say, involved in paramilitary activities are made responsible to the due process of the law. I do not think anybody could disagree with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.2/2">Let me deal with an issue that is not contained in the Bill, but to which reference has been made&#8212;the lack of a comprehensive legacy Bill. We have already heard the Lord Chief Justice speaking in Belfast this week about the issue of inquests, referring to the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly. We also heard references made today by the Director of Public Prosecutions to that particular issue. What we need to see&#8212;I hope the Government are listening&#8212;is a credible legacy Bill that is seen to be credible by victims and survivors alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.526.2/3">Since the Eames-Bradley report, we have witnessed a dilution of the proposals on the past. I say again that national security cannot be used as a catch-all for lack of transparency or to suppress the truth that victims demand and deserve. I just hope that the Government have listened today, and that they will be able&#8212;I say this with a level of humility to the Secretary of State and to the Minister&#8212;to bring forward amendments in the other place that reflect what was said here today about the pledge of office, the independent reporting commission and the new clause and related comments put forward by my hon. Friends the Members for Foyle (Mark Durkan), for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell) and myself about the implementation and reconciliation group. I note what the Minister said about those issues, but I believe that in the months and years ahead, the Government&#8212;in whatever guise&#8212;will have to return to those questions and address them. They will not wither on the vine; they will still exist.</p>

	<p pid="b.527.0/1">It is good to be able to make a contribution on Third Reading. I should like to start by paying tribute to all those who have made this &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement possible. Difficult political situations in Northern Ireland require not only strong leadership but selfless leadership, and I believe that many people on this side of the Chamber as well as many outside have contributed to this process. I want to give special thanks to the former First Minister, Peter Robinson, for his hard work in his roles as First Minister and as leader of our party.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/2">I congratulate the Secretary of State and the Minister of State on the long hours that they have put in and the significant contribution that they have made. I do not know how they kept awake in all those meetings, but they did, and they made sure that the business kept moving forward as well. They struck the right balance between those of us who are more sensitive to the past and those of us who have found it easier to move on. I also commend my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> for his comments on section 75. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24684" name="Danny Kinahan">The hon. Member for South Antrim (Danny Kinahan)</phrase> also mentioned that important issue, and I am disappointed that we did not get it sorted out. The veterans who have approached my right hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley are the same people who have come to see me in my constituency to discuss the same issues. If we were to convey all those requests from our constituents to the Minister of State, he would have a very full postbag.</p>
	<p pid="b.527.0/3">I see that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24907" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> is in his place. I should like to put on record the thanks of the citizens of Northern Ireland for the hard work that he has done and the contribution that he has made. I am ever mindful of the Ballykelly bombing; that story resonates with me and it always will. I want publicly to put on record my thanks to him for the leadership he showed on that day.</p>

	<p pid="b.527.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for being so generous about my record in Northern Ireland. I want to back up something that <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> has said. In 1988, an IRA gun team came to my house in Brussels to kill me. They were stopped because my son Alexander, aged 11, thought that something was fishy about three men asking to speak to his daddy. They went away and they killed two RAF servicemen up the road. The victims were not just in the UK; they were also on the continent of Europe, and probably elsewhere too.</p>

	<p pid="b.528.1/1">I am sure my hon. Friend will agree that when people at home in Northern Ireland have received the call to put on the uniform of the Crown forces, they have never been found wanting. For them to be denied the full implementation of the Army covenant is nothing short of scandalous, and we need to keep working to achieve that full implementation for those men and women who have done their duty and tried to bring law and order to Northern Ireland. We need to keep working on this.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-10b.528.2" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13864" speakername="Jim Shannon" colnum="528"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160310/debtext/160310-0004.htm#160310-0004.htm_spnew14">
	<p pid="b.528.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend and colleague for those comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/2">In the past few years, the Northern Ireland Assembly has had the longest sustained period of power sharing ever. Indeed, it is set to complete its first full term without suspension or collapse since before the start of the troubles. Let us look at the good things that are happening in Northern Ireland. Let us recognise that devolution is working and has the potential to work, and that under this &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement, it will do even more, only this time even better than it has in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/3">The peace has been hard earned and it is still fragile, but despite always being at the forefront of our minds, it is far from being our only achievement. The Assembly has achieved many things, including introducing free travel on public transport for the over-60s and securing Northern Ireland&#8217;s single largest investment by supporting Bombardier&#8217;s development of the new C series. Heating prices escalated, and we made payments totalling some &#163;22.5 million to 150,000 households, with each household receiving a &#163;150 fuel payment. The list goes on. It is clear that devolution with the Democratic Unionist party at the helm has really delivered for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/4">This is a hard-won deal that is good for stability; good for Unionism; good for all parties; and good for Northern Ireland. We now have a real chance to go forth and build on what has been achieved to date. We can continue to build a new Northern Ireland for all of our citizens and for everyone who lives in Northern Ireland. We have learned from our mistakes when it comes to deals. If the deal does not resemble anything close to what we want, we must walk away. We have not walked away this time, because we have a deal. The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement gives us a deal and a basis from which we can move forward. It gives us an opportunity to find a way forward for everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/5">It is important that we make the transition from agreement to implementation as smooth as possible. In his last speech as leader to the party conference, our former First Minister, Peter Robinson, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/6">&#8220;Ulster is no longer at the crossroads&#8212;we&#8217;re on the motorway and on a clear path to a better future.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/7">We are very much in that position.</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/8">Building on the achievements of the Northern Ireland Executive, led by the DUP, we have secured the exemptions, subsidies and incentives we need to move forward. They include more than &#163;500 million to help Northern Ireland move forward; and up to &#163;2 billion from the UK Government to deal with welfare reform, corporation tax, legacy issues, and public sector reform. There are formal structures to deal with the scourge of paramilitarism so that we can confine that episode to the history books where it belongs. The devolution of corporation tax is a game changer. For too long, Northern Ireland has been at a competitive disadvantage with the Republic of Ireland, which has had a much lower rate of corporation tax. With Northern Ireland enjoying relative peace and a highly educated and motivated young workforce, it now has the power to overhaul and revolutionise the Northern Ireland economy, bringing in the real quality, world-class jobs that our young people too often seek on other shores.</p>
	<p pid="b.528.2/9">The &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement does just what it says on the tin: it gives us a fresh start. Let us keep Northern Ireland on that motorway to a better future. Moving forward, we do not under any circumstances want Northern Ireland to be a special case. Indeed, building the new and leaving behind the old still remains the aim. It is hard-earned provisions such as corporation tax and other such measures in this deal that will facilitate the completion of the transformation of Northern Ireland society. We have a much better understanding among our communities, and a much better agreement on where we are going. We have a long-term vision for Northern Ireland that will benefit our children and grandchildren. That is what it is about. Let us get to work, finish the job, have a fresh start from here on in, and keep Northern Ireland moving forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.529.0/1">As we move from afternoon to dusk, there is a tendency to allow an elegiac mood to suffuse the House, which is why the optimistic and forward-looking comments of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13864" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase>&#8212;I would like to call him my hon. Friend&#8212;are so, so important. What a fitting grace note to end this afternoon&#8217;s discussions. We have today discussed matters of great seriousness&#8212;sombre matters, dark matters and worrying matters&#8212;but to hear that note from my hon. Friend gives me hope, and I think I speak for the whole House when I say so.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/2">There are two things that are important to say at the end of this Third Reading debate. First, we are actually discussing an agreement. Let us not forget that there was a time not so long ago when it was somehow doubted that there would a Stormont House agreement. It was somehow doubted that there would be a &#8220;Fresh Start&#8221; agreement. When I see the weary faces on the Government Benches and I think of those long nights, I know that it is a tribute to the individual commitment of Members on both sides of the House, from all parties and from all parts of civic and political society in Northern Ireland that we are actually here today, on the Floor of the House, discussing an agreement and a fresh start.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/3">Secondly, it is important that we have spent an afternoon discussing Northern Ireland. For too long we have tended to speak of Northern Ireland only on occasion of crisis. We tend to speak of Northern Ireland when there is an urgent question or a statement to be made. This is legislation moving forward. This is serious, sensible and sober legislation cementing the bricks in the architecture of a terrorist-free&#8212;a paramilitary-free&#8212;Northern Ireland. It will allow the innate genius of the people of Northern Ireland to flourish in a way that it has never had the opportunity to do. The fact that the people have succeeded in so many cases is a great tribute to their individual genius.</p>
	<p pid="b.529.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">The right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> quite rightly and seriously said that there was no consensus on the definition of a victim. We have considered the matter in great depth this afternoon and that discussion will continue. However, I was cheered and encouraged to hear him press the section 75 point, and I thought I saw the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State indicate that he would look further at the matter. I would like to think that that is one of the positive things that we will take away from this afternoon&#8217;s discussion, but we have not heard the end of it. We have not heard the end of the implementation of the military covenant. When I look at the people sitting on the Treasury Bench opposite, I know that there are some powerful advocates for the covenant.</p>

	<p pid="b.530.0/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the assertion of <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10172" name="Jeffrey M. Donaldson">the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson)</phrase> about the definition of a victim, and he indicates that he has some sympathy with that. To be fair, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and the Secretary of State also indicated their broad sympathy. However, as my late father used to say, &#8220;My pockets are full of that sympathy,&#8221; but it does nothing without action. I wonder when there will be action from the Government to do something about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.530.1/1">We have heard advice on the Floor of the House from the Prime Minister&#8217;s mother, and we have now heard advice from the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s father. They are wise words. It is often said that warm words do not heat a cold house, and we need to see more action. The point that I was making is that I see people on the Treasury Bench who have a commitment to the implementation of the military covenant and experience of forces life, which gives me some cause for optimism.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/2">The important, pertinent points made by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> resonated across the House and must be studied. When he talked about the nature of implementation within the Executive&#8212;obviously based on his own experience&#8212;he made some points that we cannot resile from and must discuss further. I love his expression about seeking a broader bandwidth. If he was an advertising copywriter, he would have made a fortune by now because he comes up with such wonderful expressions. I think we know what he is talking about and it is another thing to which we will have to return.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/3">Forgive me for saying so, Mr Deputy Speaker, but <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24684" name="Danny Kinahan">the hon. Member for South Antrim (Danny Kinahan)</phrase> made an emotional contribution, and quite rightly so. It came from the strength of emotion. He was absolutely right when he talked about people wanting to move on. He referred to the military being part of society. Let us not forget that, after all, the military are civilians in uniform. They are not a separate breed of people or race. They did not emerge from some test tube somewhere; they are civilians in uniform. Many of us have worn uniform and many of us might wear a uniform in the future. I hasten to add that Her Majesty would have to be very desperate to recall me to the colours. I believe that the Navy has moved on from sails since I left.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13856" name="Margaret Ritchie">The hon. Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie)</phrase> raised another point that we will have to consider again: national security. The sensitivity, particularly around the identification of agents, is intensely important, and I understand the strictures to which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/5">This has been a positive experience overall. Some considerable differences have been ventilated, particularly on the issue of the oath, which may well be reconsidered in another place. I cannot speak for the Government&#8212; I never could even when we were in government&#8212;but I would like to think that, with good will and a fair following wind, there may be the possibility of the matter being considered. The Bill, in its totality and its generality, has the support of the House. We believe that the establishment of the independent reporting commission and the changes to the working of the Assembly, most of which were not contentious, are steps of progress that show a better way forward and should be supported.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/6">It has to be said that further measures must be adopted to tackle paramilitarism, and we have done that this afternoon. Everybody in every speech that has been made has expressed a detestation of those who look back to the days of blood, to the bloody wars and to the paramilitaries&#8217; ruling the streets of Northern Ireland. We all know what a wonderful, incredible place Northern Ireland can be, what a place of stunning beauty and great initiative, entrepreneurship, imagination and wonderful people. When the dead hand of the paramilitaries is taken off, who knows what the people of Northern Ireland will achieve? Who knows how they might flourish even more?</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/7">I know that we all wish the Secretary of State and the Minister well in the work that they are doing, but I would like to think that everybody in the House also recognises the incredible contribution, sacrifices and devotion, as well as the sometimes unhappy and unwilling compromises, of politicians in Northern Ireland. We can be proud of the people who represent the people of Northern Ireland. This afternoon we heard much about them at their best.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/8">Northern Ireland is continuing progress towards what we all want to see. A peaceful, prosperous future has taken another small step forward this afternoon. Let the words of the hon. Member for Strangford ring in our ears as we go forward towards those sunlit uplands and that peaceful, prosperous future.</p>
	<p pid="b.530.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

	<p pid="b.532.1/3">The petition of residents of Newark,</p>
	<p pid="b.532.1/4">Declares that the Torch Academy Group&#8217;s application for a free school in Newark should be accepted; notes that almost 50% of all secondary school pupils, resident in Newark, are currently being educated at schools outside of the town; further that many parents choose to educate their children at schools outside of the town because they are not satisfied by the academic standards routinely achieved by existing secondary schools in the town; further that over 400 children from Newark are currently being educated at Toot Hill school, Bingham, an outstanding Academy run by the Torch Academy Group; believes that the application provides a once in a generation opportunity to establish a benchmark outstanding secondary school in Newark which all parents of the town can have the confidence to send their children to; further notes that in excess of 200 children have already been registered as prospective pupils for Newark Free School; and acknowledges the outstanding leadership of Mr John Tomasevic, Chief Executive Officer of the Torch Academy Group which is leading the application.</p>

	<p pid="b.533.2/1">It is a great privilege to be called to speak in my first Adjournment debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and for it to arrive early, which is not something we can always say about trains on the great eastern main line.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.2/2">The great eastern main line is a massive issue for people in my constituency. Our railways are a key strategic asset and the performance of the line has, frankly, not always been up to scratch. I want to focus on an important part of the line: the ticketing structure, and the annual, monthly or weekly season tickets that my constituents buy. I feel strongly about the availability of part-time season tickets.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.2/3">I am the first to recognise that hon. Members on both sides of the House have raised this issue and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24778" name="Priti Patel">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase> has done a lot of work on it. Pressure groups such as Transport Focus have campaigned for it. I am proud to say that it featured in the victorious Conservative manifesto at the last general election, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.533.2/4">&#8220;We will also introduce smart ticketing and part-time season tickets.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.533.2/5">Why did I want to secure this Adjournment debate? It is basically due to lobbying from the focus group&#8212;the lobby group&#8212;that matters more than any other to me: the hard-working commuters and constituents of South Suffolk. To make my case, there is nothing better I can do than to follow the example of the Leader of the Opposition and read two emails from my constituents. I have had many emails about this, but two in particular cover the case for flexible ticketing.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.2/6">The first is from&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.533.4/1">Calm down. It is from Deborah Adams of Sudbury. Sudbury is the main town in my constituency&#8212;a beautiful market town; the home of the great Thomas Gainsborough. She writes:</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/2">&#8220;A few years ago David Cameron announced the phased introduction of flexible season tickets for rail travel. As someone that commutes to London from Sudbury 2-3 days a week, this struck me as a very good idea. However, I have not been able to find out any more about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/3">Flexible season tickets are an excellent idea, especially for constituencies like ours where there are large numbers of commuters. Many work from home some days, which makes the price of a regular season ticket of questionable value.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/4">Flexible season tickets would encourage more people to work from home some days, which would reduce overcrowding on the trains, and would benefit South Suffolk, as more people would have time to spend their London wages locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/5">It is very old-fashioned to think that workers go to their office every day and we should not be penalised for flexible working.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/6">A system whereby a commuter could say buy 10 day returns for the price of 6-7 would really encourage the flexibility that the modern work force needs when juggling work and family life.</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/7">What do you think about this?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.533.4/8">She hits the nail on the head.</p>

	<p pid="b.534.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that his constituent makes a good case for using new technology and the new options in e-ticketing? If it is possible to board a plane using one&#8217;s iPhone, would it not be possible to board a train?</p>

	<p pid="b.534.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I will talk about technology later in my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/2">Another email that hits on some other points is from Russell Badrick, a solicitor who works in London but lives in Nayland, a beautiful village on the Suffolk-Essex border by the river Stour. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/3">&#8220;I was born in the constituency, and have recently moved down the road from you, to Nayland. I am a commuter and work in London. I work from home one day a week, and I commute the other four days.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/4">You no doubt must receive a great many messages complaining about the Abellio Greater Anglia Services, which are generally very poor. The notion that they might be nationalised is obviously crazy&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/5">he is clearly sound. He continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/6">&#8220;I wanted to ask you if anything was being done to persuade Abellio to introduce flexible tickets? It is becoming increasingly common for people to work from home, yet we are still forced to pay the season tickets for the entire week, month or year. For me, that means paying for 365 days of travel, when in fact I only travel on 208 of these. In fact, when holidays are discounted, I only travel 192 days a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/7">On the basis of me paying &#163;5,520 a year (i.e. 15.12 a day), this means I am really overpaying for 173 days a year &#8211; i.e. a full &#163;2615.76 &#8211; again, obviously crazy.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/8">I appreciate this is a business decision on the part of Abellio, but in this situation I, like many of your constituents, are captive consumers. Can anything be done about this?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.534.1/9">I should add as a caveat that while he talks about &#163;2,615.76, Members&#8212;especially my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25437" name="Craig Mackinlay">the Member for South Thanet (Craig Mackinlay)</phrase>, who I believe is an accountant&#8212;will know that that is taxed income, so the real figure is far more than that.</p>

	<p pid="b.534.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a compelling case. We all know that there is a commuter belt around London and other major towns and cities, but there is a huge economic opportunity for towns and communities just beyond that, from where commuting into a great city full of opportunities, such as London, is possible one or two days a week, but is onerous five days a week. In my constituency, there are 500 people with daily commuter season tickets from Newark to London, but it is very tiring to make that journey every day of the week and most of those individuals do it only one, two or three days a week. Does my hon. Friend agree that we want people to have these opportunities because that brings wealth and new opportunities for fulfilling careers into a whole belt an hour or more further north, south, east and west of London?</p>

	<p pid="b.534.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. When I had the pleasure of campaigning in his by-election, I remarked that I was in a beautiful part of his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.534.3/2">Before turning to the points made by my commuting constituents, I want to set the context of South Suffolk. In many ways, it fits the pattern described by my hon. Friend. The key to its beauty is that although we are not that far from London in commuting terms, we really feel like we are in East Anglia. There are many beautiful counties in the south-east, but people feel the pull of the M25 and of London. Once they get to South Suffolk, they feel as though they are in a different part of the country. The area has beautiful ancient villages such as Lavenham and Long Melford, which are famous and attract many tourists. Nevertheless, from Colchester, which is an 18-minute drive from my village, we can take the express train and get to Liverpool Street in 47 minutes. Although we are a long way from London in one respect, we are certainly well within commuting distance.</p>

	<p pid="b.535.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing a timely debate. I do not wish to be political, but members of voluntary organisations, such as church people, who have to come to London from Coventry or Birmingham find their travel very expensive. Many of them have retired. Although the operating companies have assured us that they will provide cheap travel, they have not done so. Those people find that they are spending four times more than they would have spent in the past. What does the hon. Gentleman think about that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-10b.535.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" speakername="James Cartlidge" colnum="535"  time="016:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160310/debtext/160310-0004.htm#160310-0004.htm_spnew27">
	<p pid="b.535.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. Towards the end of my remarks, I will come on to the question of how we pay for cheaper travel, because the rail operating companies obviously have to find the revenue from somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.1/2">I represent a commuting constituency, although fine manufacturing industries are based there, as well as agriculture. I was brought up in Barnet in north London and moved first to Essex. When Emily and I moved our family out to South Suffolk, it was because we wanted to be able to afford a house that had some land and was in a beautiful part of the world so that we could have that quality of life, and because we wanted to move out of the London rush, so to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.1/3">This issue will become ever bigger. Partly because of London house prices, there will be a great exodus, particularly of professional families, to Suffolk, Kent and so on, right up to Newark. People will move out in search of a better quality of life. If that is their motive, will they still expect to travel five days a week when they face such a long journey? As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25227" name="Robert Jenrick">the Member for Newark (Robert Jenrick)</phrase> said, many of them will travel four days a week, and that is my experience. I have noticed a marked number of people on my local trains doing four or three days because the journey is so long.</p>

	<p pid="b.535.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate on an important subject. As in his constituency, many of my constituents have moved away from London for precisely the reasons as he articulated. They now travel from stations around the Solent region&#8212;Havant, Emsworth and Bedhampton &#8212;to London for work. Will my hon. Friend join me in calling on South West Trains and Southern to reflect changing living and working habits in their flexible fare arrangements?</p>

	<p pid="b.535.3/1">I am more than happy to do that. The franchise in our area is Abellio Greater Anglia. My region is fortunate in at least one sense&#8212;I am not sure what the score is in my hon. Friend&#8217;s region&#8212;because the franchise is up. There are three bids going in for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.3/2">Let me take a few of the key points from my constituents about why we should have part-time tickets and more flexible ticketing. Deborah from Sudbury said:</p>
	<p pid="b.535.3/3">&#8220;It is very old-fashioned to think that workers go to their office every day and we should not be penalised for flexible working&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.535.3/4">I totally agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.535.3/5">Some years ago, I went to a presentation about voting patterns by a leading American psephologist. He said there are three groups of voters in the country. I cannot remember two of them, but the other was symbolised by a grey cloud. That was not a political point; it was about character and how we appeal to different types of voter. The voters symbolised by the grey cloud had certain features, one of which was that they were moved by newspaper headlines about bad weather, which is quite interesting. However, the most common feature was that they ate their dinner at the same time every day&#8212;quite frankly, that describes my late grandad. However, the era of predictability, of nine to five and of everyone doing the same thing all the time is gone; it has been shattered and blown apart by liberalisation and globalisation. That might be a good thing or a bad thing, but it is a fact of life that we and our constituents all face, and our rail ticketing system should reflect that.</p>

	<p pid="b.536.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Would he say that this is also about reflecting families&#8217; changing lifestyles, in that the 1960s model&#8212;the father commuting to work five days a week while the wife was at home with the children&#8212;is now gone? With men and women rightly sharing parental responsibilities, they may wish to divide up the days of the week that they work, and season tickets need to reflect that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2016-03-10b.536.1" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" speakername="James Cartlidge" colnum="536"  time="016:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160310/debtext/160310-0004.htm#160310-0004.htm_spnew31">
	<p pid="b.536.1/1">That is an excellent point. Recent Office for National Statistics data show that between April and June 2015, just over 7.3 million people had a flexible working pattern. By the way, that is people who are employed; it does not include the army of people such as self-employed contractors who go into London a few days a week. We have a flexible labour market and flexible working, but our rail ticketing system is, in effect, stuck in the same Julian calendar that we have had since 46 BC. If that sounds like a long time, hon. Members should wait until they get stuck on a delayed service out of Liverpool Street.</p>
	<p pid="b.536.1/2">Russell from Nayland made an important point about bad value for money:</p>
	<p pid="b.536.1/3">&#8220;On the basis of me paying &#163;5520 a year&#8230;this means I am really overpaying for 173 days a year&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.536.1/4">of travel, which is an extraordinary statistic. That means that he is, in reality, paying &#163;2,615.76 or, depending on his tax bracket&#8212;if he is a solicitor, I suspect it is 40%&#8212;&#163;4,000 or more for those 173 days. That is a big deal, particularly in our region, because an extensive survey recently undertaken by Transport Focus found that just 21% of the commuters on Abellio Greater Anglia were satisfied that their ticket was value for money, compared with 34% on other lines. I realise that I may end up in a competition with hon. Members in the Chamber about whose line has fewer happy customers, but there is no doubt that value for money is a big concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.536.1/5">It is fair to say that if there was more satisfaction with value for money in general, the issue of part-time tickets would not actually feature. I get these emails because people feel frustrated that they look hard at what they are getting and think, &#8220;Hold on a minute. I&#8217;m paying for Saturday, Sunday and Friday.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.537.0/1">Perhaps I could add another point. When we think of those who commute into central London, we tend to think they are on higher incomes, but that is not always the case. I have many constituents who commute into London, but also some who commute into Nottingham and Derby, and some of them might be on very low incomes. The average wage in my constituency is &#163;23,000 a year, and commuting costs, even from Nottingham to Derby, certainly eat into that. One group that came to me recently was made up of apprentices; they do not go to work every day of the week, because, in many cases, they will be doing courses at the local college. They might want to go to Newark College, which they can walk to, one day a week, and do three or four days a week at Rolls-Royce in Derby. A full-time season ticket will eat into their quite modest incomes.</p>

	<p pid="b.537.1/1">Another excellent point.</p>
	<p pid="b.537.1/2">What is to be done? To go back to my constituents, Deborah suggested this:</p>
	<p pid="b.537.1/3">&#8220;A system whereby a commuter could, say, buy 10 day returns for the price of 6-7 would really encourage the flexibility that the modern work force needs when juggling work and family life.&#8221;</p>

Of course, that has been phased out now that we have moved to the Oyster system. The key problem with the previous system was the absence of technology.

To be fair to the Government, in October 2013 the Department for Transport published its fares and ticketing review, which proposed several schemes to make ticketing more flexible, including long-distance pricing, advance tickets on the day of sale and flexible part-time season tickets. The report stated that the plans could mean</p>
	<p pid="b.537.5/3">&#8220;receiving a discount on season tickets for travelling three days rather than five, or for travelling earlier or later, avoiding the busiest trains, or there could even be an incentive for not travelling on certain days of the week&#8221;,</p>

	<p pid="b.538.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way again. He is making a very strong case for flexible ticketing in terms of not only the number of days, but the way in which we manage demand on the railways. Often there is capacity available, but it is underutilised, so flexible ticketing could incentivise us to make better use of our railways. That is particularly true of students; indeed, those in my constituency have said that they would welcome that.</p>

	<p pid="b.538.1/1">That is another very good point.</p>
	<p pid="b.538.1/2">The south-east flexible ticketing programme is the main system that is being developed. There are many ways to describe it, but I call it the Network SouthEast Oyster: it is the equivalent of Oyster for the south-east overground. The beauty of South Suffolk, however, is that technically we are not in the south-east, but fortunately we are part of the south-east flexible ticketing system. I hope the Minister will tell us more about that programme and the progress it is making.</p>
	<p pid="b.538.1/3">I wrote to the three companies bidding for the Anglian franchise to ask them what their plans were for flexible ticketing. Chris Atkinson of National Express highlighted that it currently holds the c2c franchise and that flexible season tickets will be offered on that line as early as this summer, so progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="b.538.1/4">Jamie Burles of Abellio Greater Anglia explained that the company will be extending two innovative flexible ticketing schemes to customers during the current franchise, which I welcome. The first will be SEFT, which I have described, and he also told me of a live trial with a third-party smart ticketing supplier that is providing a post-travel account-based payment solution&#8212;the multi-pass scheme&#8212;which is currently being trialled on the Cambridge to London line. The company plans to extend it to other parts of the network in the first quarter of this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.538.2/1">My hon. Friend has identified how technology can solve the problem. It is remarkable how the Oyster system can completely change our approach to tickets and the archaic way of doing things. The situation is similar in my constituency. More and more people are moving there&#8212;who can blame them, given that it is a beautiful part of east Kent?&#8212;but the cost per year for high-speed rail is more than &#163;6,000. We find that modern working can mean working two or three days a week. I hope that this debate will encourage the train companies to consider their commerciality, because this could be good for them as well as for local residents, who are the key to improving the local economy of those over-50-mile-fringes outside London.</p>

	<p pid="b.539.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I was about to mention Oyster and technology. In January, Transport for London said that more than a quarter of the capital&#8217;s pay-as-you-go transport customers were now using contactless payment, including smartphones and debit cards. That is an extraordinary statistic. Usage has grown incredibly quickly, and that shows the potential of technology. There is no reason why my hon. Friends should not put pressure on bidding companies in their area to take up smart ticketing when the franchises come up.</p>

	<p pid="b.539.1/1">I am envious of other hon. Members who are here today. Some of us do not even have a station in our constituency, so I have to make a plug for a station. Notwithstanding that, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point, because it brings up the broader need for flexible travel and flexible pricing. Can they be used to tackle problems such as congestion?</p>

	<p pid="b.539.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention. She has reminded me that I should add, for the record, that I have only one station, Sudbury, in my constituency. The Sudbury line goes to Marks Tey, where it joins the main line. Apart from Sudbury, all the stations on that line are in Essex. Many of my constituents go to Manningtree, Colchester or Ipswich, which is on the main line into London. I am sure that even though my hon. Friend has no station in her constituency, many of her constituents are rail commuters who travel to stations nearby.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/2">I have a few specific questions for the Minister. In a situation like that of Anglia, where we have a live franchise bidding process, to what extent can we still influence that? Given the interest in flexible ticketing, to what extent could the Department for Transport go back to the bidders and ask them to push for better flexible ticketing solutions? Another hon. Member, who could not make it today, asked me how he could get involved with the South West franchise, which is coming up for renewal soon. I suspect other hon. Members will want to do likewise.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/3">On technology, I was struck by the point about the use of smartphones on Oyster. To what extent is smartphone-based ticketing possible with the SEFT system, and how soon could that come about&#8212;if, indeed, it is not already coming about through testing?</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/4">Finally&#8212;I believe that this is unique to my region; certainly, I do not think it applies to other Members who are here&#8212;there are live discussions about a combined authority between Suffolk, Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. That is a major step for our part of the world. What powers does the Minister think might be given to an elected mayor or combined authority in relation to ticketing, flexibility and so on? That is a classic example of the sorts of powers they should have.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/5">On cost, I am a businessman by background and a Conservative, so I am well aware that money does not grow on trees, and that if we suggest policies we have to be responsible and explain where the money will come from. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet said, I think that more flexible ticketing will pay for itself, to a certain extent. It will entice a certain type of skilled person&#8212;someone who has become a full-time mum, for example&#8212;back into the workplace because they can commute a few days a week. That will suit their living pattern and their work-life balance. In other words, it will bring new revenue to the companies, so I think they should embrace it and be bold about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.539.2/6">The other point I would make is that if rail companies would lose a lot of money by introducing part-time tickets, that tells us that they are basing their business model on something that is not sustainable or, dare I say it, even fair. The idea that profits are based on people paying for millions of days that they never use and phantom journeys that they will never take seems quite incredible.</p>

	<p pid="b.540.0/1">My hon. Friend is being generous in allowing interventions. As other hon. Members have said, there is a huge economic opportunity for rail companies to create a whole new generation&#8212;a wave&#8212;of commuters beyond the classic 50-mile commuter belt and spread those opportunities another 50 miles or 100 miles outside London. That is a massive financial opportunity for train companies that they will have to harness over the next 10 or 20 years as London becomes an increasingly expensive place to live and commuters look not just to the classic commuter belt, but as far as my constituency in the north midlands.</p>

	<p pid="b.540.1/1">That is the key point. The rail companies really need to embrace that as a positive opportunity to strengthen their revenues and build a new customer base.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.1/2">The Government need to see the big picture in terms of the wider economy. There is no doubt that this country&#8217;s long-standing economic failing has been, and continues to be, relatively low productivity compared with other European nations. However, one of our big assets is our flexible labour force. Every part of our country, our key infrastructure and the way in which we interact with that infrastructure should reflect the fact that we have a flexible labour market and a mobile workforce. That will maximise productivity, and it will ensure prosperity and a better work-life balance for years to come. I say to my hon. Friend the Minister that in the era of flexi-time, we need flexi-fares.</p>

	<p pid="b.540.3/1">I am a former Whip, so I know the tricks. I should say that I will not take all of the remaining time.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/2">I want to commend my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25414" name="James Cartlidge">the Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge)</phrase> for securing this debate. His constituents are incredibly lucky to have him. The same goes for all my hon. Friends in the Chamber tonight. The class of 2015 is particularly assiduous in campaigning. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Some Members from previous classes are also assiduous. I sometimes feel I am the most popular Minister, even though that is not true, because I am the one most frequently lobbied&#8212;on train-related issues. I appreciate the opportunity to answer some of my hon. Friend&#8217;s questions and to put on the record some of things that the Government are doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/3">I first want to unpick what we mean by part-time season tickets. I think the definition is quite confusing. We mean a product that people who work part-time&#8212;about 27% of workers do so&#8212;can buy to give them, in effect, a multibuy discount. With that product they would not be forced to buy weekly season tickets, but something more suitable for their journeys. My hon. Friend made very good points about grey consumers&#8212;is that what he called them?&#8212;who sit at home having caught the 18.23 every day. That pattern is changing so dramatically. Technology is liberating many people from the workplace. We know that many more women, in particular, are working part time. The Government are absolutely committed&#8212;indeed, we have committed funding&#8212;to ensuring that such people can use the rail system effectively. In terms of &#8220;car-nay&#8221; or &#8220;car-net&#8221;, depending on how my hon. Friend used to pronounce that word in &#8220;Bar-nay&#8221; or &#8220;Bar-net&#8221;, I like to think of carnets as a multibuy discount.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/4">I want to separate out another thing about which the debate has sometimes got bogged down. The decision on multibuy discounts is separate from the decision on ticketing technology. It is perfectly possible&#8212;indeed, this happens already&#8212;to buy carnets on the rail network, albeit in ticketing form. People can buy 10 tickets for the price of nine, and there are various other options. However, we must be careful not to try to have a big bang to solve all these problems at once. The industry has often hidden behind the excuse that this is all so terribly difficult. For me, it is simply a question of sorting out the right fares to suit this part-time working group, which is separate from the issue of ticketing technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/5">As my hon. Friend well knows, because he is a very good businessman, there are a few questions to pick through when we talk about fares. The two main issues are those of cost and timing. On cost, train companies say that if people who currently buy full-time season tickets are suddenly given the opportunity to buy tickets for less, it will lead to less revenue, meaning that somebody will have to pay. My understanding is that only about 10% of current rail travellers work part time, so those numbers may be lower than they are represented to be, but ultimately, if there is an additional cost in the form of reduced revenue for the rail industry, somebody will have to pay. That will be other fare payers, through increased ticket prices&#8212;we absolutely do not want that, which is why we have capped rail fares for the duration of this Parliament&#8212;or the Government, who will be asked to pay up front or through the franchising process, or the companies, which will have to commit their own capital to make up for the shortfall in fares.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/6">All those points are valid. The Government have committed &#163;132 million to introducing such products during this Parliament, so we are clearly prepared to pay our fair share. However, the measure is slightly crude, because it ignores some of the points very well made by my hon. Friends. There is a series of costs to society that are avoided by getting people to use trains, such as the cost of congestion, which we always find very difficult to price.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/7">There is also a massive productivity uplift from getting more people travelling. We know we have a massive skills shortage in this country, so if we can get more people back into work part time and working more effectively, that has to be good for productivity. As we have seen with Transport for London, if people are given slightly more attractive fares, more people will travel, so what a company might lose in value, it will gain in volume. It seems difficult to get people to model that in the round. That is always difficult with any infrastructure investment, but I believe we should be considering these benefits collectively, and that is why the Government have underpinned those programmes with &#163;132 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/8">On timing, we can either impose the roll-out on the industry all at once, or we can do it with the franchising competition. My preference is always to do it while franchising, because a competed price is always a better price. We are relying on the franchising process to drive innovation wherever possible, albeit with Government underpinning if we want to do things that cut across the franchising schedule. Many franchising competitions are ongoing, including that in the constituency of my hon. Friend. I cannot possibly say anything about what is happening, because those bids are live and under evaluation, but my hon. Friend knows&#8212;he has campaigned assiduously on this&#8212;that we have made it clear to bidders that we are looking for a step change in technology, in the customer experience, and in how innovative ticketing solutions are delivered. I am confident that we will start to see progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/9">As my hon. Friend said, Abellio Greater Anglia has introduced two forms of ticketing progress. One is underpinned by the Government&#8217;s &#163;80 million investment in the south-east flexible ticketing scheme, and we will meet our contractual commitments. SEFT is basically providing a back office for rail companies to offer smart season tickets on a key card basis, and I look forward to launching that product in a couple of weeks from Cambridge station. It will be going live on my hon. Friend&#8217;s line, and is already live under other train operating companies in the south-east. Therefore, not only do we have a digital ticket, but there is also the opportunity to build a customer relationship, and to offer things such as season ticket discounts to provide potentially automated compensation in the way that C2C does. That is a good step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/10">Abellio Greater Anglia is trialling the MultiPass scheme that uses low-energy Bluetooth readers across stations, tracks people via their phone and works out their journey patterns, and bills them after the fact. That is a great example of innovation in the industry. My hon. Friend asked whether it was possible to travel using a smartphone, and it is. The m-ticket scheme is already up and running. I went to see it a year or so ago in the north of England, and it is spreading rapidly. It is basically a series of barcodes that are sent straight to a mobile phone. Someone taps that, and it becomes their ticket to travel. It is brilliant and should be much more cost-effective for the operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/11">There is a lot of ticketing innovation out there for us to unleash. Rather than sitting around waiting to be told what to do by the Government&#8212;who despite the best efforts of the brilliant officials in the Department are not necessarily on top of the latest technological revolutions&#8212;those companies that are closest to customers should innovate and be prepared to put in their capital and innovation to drive results. We want the franchising process to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/12">My hon. Friend asked me some specific questions. During the franchise, can we go back and influence what is happening with the bidders? The bids we have refer to our terms and conditions, which include fairly specific requirements on smart ticketing and part-time season tickets or multibuy discounts. He will also know&#8212;I am proud of this&#8212;that this franchise is a step change from where we were five or 10 years ago, as have been the last few franchises that I have let. We are putting in the franchise the highest level of quality scoring&#8212;the stuff that faces the passenger&#8212;that we have ever seen. We have had other debates on rolling stock, and the quality of that is not what it should be. This franchise will have the highest weighting for improved rolling stock that we have seen so far.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/13">We will also have tough targets to contract for customer outcomes&#8212;one might imagine that we would have done that previously, but that has not always been the case. We are contracting to ensure that the punctuality and customer satisfaction targets that we want are an output &#8212;we are contracting not for inputs, but for outputs&#8212;and I think that we will see a positive result when we assess the various bids for this competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/14">My hon. Friend asked about technology. I have mentioned the multi-pass trial, which uses low-energy Bluetooth readers. We already have Smartphones that are using a digital barcode, which can also be printed out, as a way of allowing people to move around the system. A chap on the Moscow metro has his smartcard implanted in his wrist, so he is a human swiper; he just walks through and away he goes. I am not advocating that, although my hon. Friend would perhaps like to pilot it, but we are moving very rapidly in this country to innovate.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/15">I have been shameless in calling for the death of the tangerine ticket. It bothers me that season ticket holders have scrabby old bits of paper that fray and wear out. I am sick to death of feeding my seat reservation coupon through the gate and shuffling through a great raft of tickets. This is 1970s technology and we want a 21st-century transport network. That is why the Government are so committed, both contractually and financially, to underpinning this technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/16">My hon. Friend asked me about the combined authority, and he knows that we are great fans of devolution. We think that the best way to spend the record levels of investment in the rail programme is by pushing it through to local people&#8212;to local authorities&#8212;who are best placed to spend it. I must take the opportunity to commend the work that has been done by local councils, local enterprise partnerships and the so-called &#8220;Norwich in 90, Ipswich in 60&#8221; taskforce. They really have taken an argument about economic value added and used it to shape what they want franchising to look like in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/17">This is an excellent opportunity not only to put on the record the progress that we are making and the Government&#8217;s commitment to rolling out the SEFT contractual obligations, but to say that we do not want to stand still and be backing only one technology. There is a world of ticketing innovation out there and we want to be clear that it is to be delivered as soon as possible to customers. The Government stand by ready to underpin some of this, but we expect operators to be looking carefully at the business case themselves and thinking about how they can get people travelling off peak. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25419" name="Ranil Jayawardena">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Jayawardena)</phrase> made an important point about that, because the trains are full at the peak but are carrying fresh air for large parts of the day. Let us have a ticketing and fares structure that gets people using those trains, so that we do not have to keep building expensive new tracks and buying new trains to deal with the peak demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.540.3/18">I remain extremely committed to rolling out what I prefer to call a multibuy discount ticket, although my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk has a snappy way with his branding and can perhaps help us to come up with a snappy title for this part-time season ticket thing that we all want, even though we cannot necessarily come up with a good title. The Government are committed to these innovative products as part of the biggest railway investment we have seen in this country since Victorian times.</p>
