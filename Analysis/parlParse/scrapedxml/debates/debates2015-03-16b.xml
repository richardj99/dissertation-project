	<p pid="b.519.7/1">My right hon. Friend has made a very reasonable point. I will of course liaise with both council leaders, and will send them a copy of <i>Hansard. </i>The duty not just to consult but to co-operate is immensely important, and most local authorities co-operate very harmoniously. They have a responsibility to work together: after all, the people for whom they are working together are the general population who elect them.</p>

	<p pid="b.519.9/1">That is a very good question. The duty to co-operate was originally designed to apply to planning and housing numbers, but it clearly has a much wider application in the context of both economic development and social policy. Any sensible authority&#8212;and metropolitan authorities in particular, given their proximity to each</p>

	<p pid="b.520.0/1">Ellar Ghyll tip is just inside the Leeds city council boundary, but is next to Menston, in my constituency, and is heavily used by its residents. The council is happy to continue the existing reciprocal arrangement with Bradford council, but Bradford has refused to do so. That means that my constituents will have to pass a tip that is next door to them to visit one that is a number of miles away, and it will undoubtedly lead to more fly-tipping. Will the Secretary of State intervene and knock some heads together in order to reverse the ridiculous decision of the Labour council in Bradford?</p>

	<p pid="b.520.1/2">It is immensely important to recognise the purpose of this arrangement, which is to ensure that members of the public receive a decent service. When I was leader of Bradford council, I enjoyed a very harmonious relationship with Leeds, and I hope that that relationship can be quickly restored.</p>

	<p pid="b.520.2/1">In recent months I have been contacted by more than 20 parents, all of them with children who have been housed in the borough of Slough by other local authorities because of the workings of benefit caps and the like. Parents are having real problems getting their children to school, using family networks and so on. What will the Secretary of State do to help them, and help local authorities to communicate better with each other about families who are dumped from other boroughs?</p>

	<p pid="b.520.3/1">I am sure that the right hon. Lady is familiar with the authorities in question. I urge her to contact them, and try to persuade them to co-operate. It is obviously not satisfactory for children to have to travel large distances to school. The whole point of localism is that local people should be able to make decisions, and, surely to goodness, it must be possible for two local authorities to reach a sensible decision without the Government&#8217;s having to intervene.</p>

I am pleased to welcome their positive initiative, which will help to make the planning process faster and more certain for developers in Pendle. I am pleased that we have been able to make &#163;5 million available to local authorities who pilot local development orders that grant planning permission for housing on suitable brownfield sites.</p>

	<p pid="b.521.1/1">I welcome the Minister&#8217;s response. If what he says is true, why was St Leonard&#8217;s hospital in my constituency given to PropCo&#8212;NHS Property Services Ltd&#8212;in the NHS and why has the fire station, which was closed, been sold for a rumoured &#163;28 million, and neither for local housing?

The fact is that home ownership peaked in 2005 and fell dramatically in the five years of the last Labour Government. The private rental sector is an attractive part of the housing mix for a large number of people, and in the past 12 months this Government have put in place a huge number of reforms to regulate the sector. They include the regulation of letting agencies to ensure that they all belong to an ombudsman scheme, that they are completely transparent</p>

Developers should be able to look at a local plan and have confidence that they can develop where land is allocated in that plan, but, as he rightly says, outside that they should find it the most difficult thing in the world to do if they have not got agreement with the local authority. It is absolutely right that his local authority has its local plan in place, and I encourage villages in the area and elsewhere to look at neighbourhood planning, to give even further protection to the areas over which people want to have control.</p>

Trusting local people to make the right decisions for their areas is paying dividends.

In 2009-10, the last year of the previous Government, 39,000 social rented homes were started. In 2013-14, 3,961 were started.

They must also have quality fitness support and six months of remedial training if they lose fitness but do not qualify for ill-health retirement. In addition, if fire authorities comply with the national framework, no firefighter will find themselves with no job and no pension. If a fire authority does not comply, the Secretary of State will intervene. Employers are now working on guidance to show how they will implement the new principles in the framework, and that will include the process with the firefighter and the principles on which an unreduced pension would be offered.

Leeds city council is currently producing a site allocation plan, but neighbourhood planning organisations in my constituency are becoming increasingly frustrated by the council&#8217;s lack of consultation with them on the issue.

Is it not the truth that the Secretary of State has also broken his promise to the elderly people of England and that it has happened because in the past five years he has taken decisions about funding that have been unfair to councils and because, as many councils of all parties think, he has failed to stand up for local government?</p>

Traditionally, in my experience of the House, when a member of the royal family visits a constituency, the Member of Parliament is apprised of that fact. That became a convention, but it seems that with the proliferation of deputy lieutenants of counties&#8212;there are many of them these days&#8212;that protocol no longer holds.

	<p pid="b.542.3/1">I will detain the House for just a brief moment. I indicated some months ago to the Chief Whip that it was my intention not to apply to stay on the Committee if I am fortunate enough to be re-elected to another term in this House. I did so because, although the intelligence agencies are, for the most part, well-resourced, well-led and do everything that we expect them to do, the situation is not so rosy for defence policy. In a choice between focusing on where I might be able to make a difference&#8212;on defence policy&#8212;and continuing with the pleasurable task of overseeing the intelligence and security services, I have opted for the former.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.3/2">I should like to take this opportunity to say that it has been a fascinating five years, working with the excellent staff and under the outstanding chairmanship of my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40340" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>. The Committee has worked harmoniously on many issues. I should like leave my term with the Committee by putting on the record just one thought. The intelligence agencies, the Security Service and GCHQ are damned if they do and damned if they do not. I saw this in relation to two inquiries. I shall make one point about each and then sit down to allow a great deal of unused time allocated for this short debate to be applied to other matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.3/3">In relation to the Woolwich atrocity inquiry, people asked how the intelligence services knew that the people who went on to commit the atrocity had been radicalised, yet were unable to stop them. The answer is that&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.543.1/1">The question was often asked why it was that the intelligence services knew certain people had been radicalised and held extremist views yet were able to go on to commit attacks. The answer is that until people break the law they cannot be locked up. We really would be living in a police state if everybody with extreme views was followed 24 hours a day, which is the only way in which low-level and uncomplicated attacks can be prevented. There has to be evidence of attack planning. If not, some such things will inevitably slip through the net.</p>

	<p pid="b.543.2/1">My only point on this matter is to say that, having tried to follow people, it takes 24 people to follow just one person. Just think of all the people in this country who we suspect of harbouring evil thoughts against us and imagine how big our security services would need to be.</p>

	<p pid="b.543.3/1">That is exactly the case. It would take only a few hundred people with extreme views to exhaust the resources of any reasonably-sized security service in a modern democratic state, and that must never be the case. Instead, we should look at how many complex attacks have been carried out successfully and how many have been thwarted. As far as I am aware, no complex attacks have been successfully carried out on British soil since the 7/7 atrocities.</p>
	<p pid="b.543.3/2">Moving on to the inquiry on privacy and security, this leads one to the question of where to draw the boundary between the wish to preserve the people&#8217;s privacy so their innocent communications are not examined and the need to develop leads that can be investigated further. I was a little surprised&#8212;I hope you will indulge me for a moment or two, Mr Speaker&#8212;to see a short item in <i>The Times</i> on Saturday about a protest by some of the privacy groups that had given evidence to the ISC on this question. It reads as follows:</p>
	<p pid="b.543.3/3">&#8220;Civil liberties groups demanded last night that a parliamentary committee correct its report on the surveillance state, saying they had been deliberately misrepresented. The intelligence and security committee criticised the pressure groups over their opposition to GCHQ&#8217;s collection of bulk data on communications&#8221;&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.543.5/4">Liberty, Justice and Rights Watch UK. Renate Samson, the chief executive of Big Brother Watch, asked the committee for an &#8216;immediate correction&#8217; to its published report and said that the representation of the evidence session was &#8216;improper and false&#8217;. She said that the ISC&#8217;s portrayal of the evidence was &#8216;an attempt to undermine, discredit and damage our organisation&#8217;s reputation&#8217;.

	<p pid="b.543.5/6">&#8220;If evidence emerged through bulk interception that even you acknowledged had led to terrorists being arrested or prevented from carrying out their objectives, are you saying that, as a matter of principle, you believe so strongly that bulk interception is unacceptable in a free society that you would say that that was a price we should be willing to pay, rather than allowing intelligence agencies to use bulk interception methods?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.543.5/7">Isabella Sankey, of Liberty, replied: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Dr Metcalfe, of Justice, replied:</p>
	<p pid="b.543.5/8">&#8220;Yes. Just as you would solve a lot more crimes if you had CCTV in everyone&#8217;s houses, and if you opened everyone&#8217;s mail and e-mail and read it on a daily basis. Yes, you would solve a lot more crimes and a lot more terrorists would be in jail; that would be a good thing, but it would be bad for our society as a whole.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.543.5/9">The Chair then asked:</p>
	<p pid="b.543.5/10">&#8220;And that is the view of your colleagues as well?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.543.5/11">The director of Big Brother Watch replied with one word: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.545.2/3">That the draft Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015, which were laid before this House on <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-02">2 March</phrase>, be approved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.545.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40466" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="545"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0001.htm#150316-0001.htm_spnew120">
	<p pid="b.545.3/1">Before I open the debate on the three statutory instruments, I should like to make a few remarks about the current threat related to Syria and the Government&#8217;s response to it. It has been reported that three young men were arrested at the weekend after attempting to travel from Turkey to Syria. This reflects the good working relationship that we have with the Turkish authorities. Hon. Members will understand that I cannot comment on the specifics because there is an ongoing investigation, but I will say that those seeking to travel to engage in terrorist activity in Syria or Iraq should be in no doubt that we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security, including prosecuting those who break the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/2">The Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 brought forward important new powers to disrupt the travel of those seeking to engage in terrorism-related activity. That included introducing a strengthened authority to carry scheme; I will return to that when I speak to the Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015 in a few moments. Current events are a reminder of how important and relevant these counter-terrorism measures are.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/3">It might help our consideration of these statutory instruments if I briefly outlined what the Government seek to achieve by them, and why we have brought them forward at this time. I would like to start by turning to the two communications data codes of practice. Communications data&#8212;the &#8220;who, where, when and how?&#8221; of a communication, but not its content&#8212;is crucial for fighting crime, protecting children and combating terrorism. The House will recall that last summer we enacted emergency legislation, the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014, to preserve our data retention powers, and these codes are directly consequential on that legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/4">Communications data policy can broadly be split into two areas: acquisition and retention. Acquisition is carried out by relevant public authorities such as law enforcement agencies, while retention is carried out by communications services providers. The House will immediately see that these areas are linked; if data are not retained, they cannot be accessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/5">The two codes of practice we are debating today&#8212;a revised acquisition code and a new data retention code&#8212;set out the processes and safeguards governing the retention and acquisition of communications data. They are intended to provide clarity and incorporate best practice on the use of the relevant powers, ensuring the highest standards of professionalism and compliance in this important aspect of law enforcement. We are bringing these codes forward now to ensure that the important safeguards within them, some of which follow concerns raised by the European Court of Justice judgment last year, come into force before Parliament rises.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/6">Let me turn to one of the most important new safeguards in the acquisition code: that of access to journalistic material. As right hon. and hon. Members will know, the Interception of Communications Commissioner recently conducted an inquiry into police acquisition of journalists&#8217; communications data. The measures in the revised code are intended to give effect to his recommendations, which were accepted straight away by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/7">The acquisition code that we are debating stipulates that, in seeking to acquire communications data to identify or determine the source of journalistic information, law enforcement must use production orders under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 or its equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland. We are doing this because production orders require judicial approval. This will help to protect the freedoms that journalists enjoy in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.545.3/8">Whenever law enforcement is seeking the communications data of a journalist to determine sources&#8212;this includes when police are seeking to confirm or corroborate other evidence of the identity of a journalist&#8217;s sources&#8212;the decision on the application will be made by a judge under PACE. However, that is only a stop-gap until we can make the change through primary legislation in the next Parliament. We have therefore also published a draft clause that sets out how we would seek to enshrine the commissioner&#8217;s first recommendation in primary legislation.</p>

The amendment that I tabled a couple of weeks ago referred to the protection of other communications, such as medical and legal information.

	<p pid="b.547.4/1">I appreciate that we have the commissioner&#8217;s report, that the independent reviewer&#8217;s report is imminent and that there is a time limit of December 2016. However, given the grave concern that exists about, in particular, the powers and constraints affecting journalists, will the Minister assure us that he will keep the matter under general review, and that, if a problem arose, even with these orders, by the end of the year&#8212;or, indeed, within a matter of months&#8212;he would be willing to come back to the House and look at it afresh?</p>

	<p pid="b.547.5/1">I assure my right hon. Friend, whom I congratulate on becoming a member of the Privy Council, that the matter will be kept under close scrutiny and review. We have published draft clauses, which could be enacted quickly in the next Parliament, to regularise the position. We recognise that this is an interim measure, and we want it to be enshrined in primary legislation that the House would have a full opportunity to debate. I should add that the code of practice provides for requests to be flagged up to the commissioner, and thus allows additional scrutiny to take place. I hope that that reassures my right hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/2">The commissioner also recommended further changes to the guidance in the acquisition code, and we have sought to implement that recommendation. The code is now clear about the need to consider more than rights to privacy&#8212;in particular, the right to freedom of expression</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/3">must be taken into account when that is appropriate&#8212;and it also contains new guidance on the considerations of necessity, proportionality and collateral intrusion, including unintended consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/4">The revised acquisition code enhances the operational independence of the authorising officer from the specific investigation for which communications data are required. It includes new, enhanced protections for those who may have professional duties of confidentiality or privilege. However, it is important to remember that we are debating communications data, not the content of communications.</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/5">The retention code sets out how the Government implement the requirements in the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 and the Data Retention Regulations 2014. It covers the following issues: the review, variation and revocation of data retention notices; communications service providers&#8217; ability to recover their costs; data security; oversight by the Information Commissioner and safeguards on the disclosure; and the use of retained data by communications service providers.</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/6">The House will be aware that both codes underwent public consultation. The Government received about 300 submissions from organisations and individuals suggesting amendments and providing comments on the codes. I am grateful to all who took part. We have published a summary of the submissions received and how the Government have responded to them. The Department considered all of the responses to the consultation and many of the suggestions have been adopted in the final drafts.</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/7">I would like to address briefly the final instrument in this motion: the Authority to Carry (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015. They establish a penalty regime for breach of any requirement of the authority to carry scheme 2015, which this House approved on <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-10">10 March</phrase>. A carrier may be liable to a penalty for breach of the following: a requirement to seek authority to carry a person; a requirement to provide specified information by a specified time; a requirement to provide information in a specified manner and form; a requirement to be able to receive communications in a specified manner and form; or a requirement not to carry a person when authority to carry has been refused&#8212;this is an important part of the code.</p>
	<p pid="b.547.5/8">The scheme specifies that it is the requirements set out in detailed written notices issued to carriers under the Immigration Act 1971 or the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 that must be met under the scheme, rather than those requirements being specified in detail in the scheme itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.548.1/1">The pre-existing authority to carry scheme has been used to prevent people from being able to travel to this country. It is important to note that the revised scheme deals with outbound as well as inbound, so this is an enhancement of the existing arrangements. Unfortunately, for operational reasons I cannot comment in detail on the use of the</p>
	<p pid="b.548.1/2">scheme, but I can say that requests have been made and carriers have abided by those requests to prevent people from travelling to this country. Therefore we have shown utility from the existing scheme on inbound legs, which is the point of the existing arrangement, but we are now seeking to extend it further in terms of various additional requirements, as well as also dealing with the outbound leg.</p>

	<p pid="b.549.0/1">We know of the Minister&#8217;s eloquence when asked questions by Members in this House and in the Select Committee, but he did not really give me an answer. I am not after answers on operational decisions; I want to know how many times an airline has carried when we have asked it not to carry&#8212;I do not think that that would give away any state secrets about who those people were. It is a simple matter of, &#8220;Does he know the answer? If not, will he write to us?&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.549.1/1">I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman that the circumstances he describes have, certainly to my knowledge, never occurred. We would not wish to see that happen. That underlines the purpose and utility of having the authority to carry scheme in place, but we think it important to have a penalty in place none the less. We clearly have a scheme that sets out those requirements, but it needs to have enforcement and the ability to rely on that to ensure that there is good compliance with the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/2">As I have described, a carrier may be liable to a penalty for breach of a requirement. The scheme specifies that it is the requirements set out in detailed written notices issued to carriers under the Immigration Act 1971 or the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 that must be met under the scheme, rather than those requirements being specified in detail in the scheme itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/3">The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has reported these regulations to the House and drawn specific attention to them. It considers that the scheme imposes some requirements</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/4">&#8220;under which the relevant matters are all to be particularised subsequently in a way that is left unspecified in the Scheme itself&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/5">That is correct. The scheme identifies that the detailed specifications are in the requirements imposed on carriers under the 1971 Act or the 2006 Act. Carriers subject to specific requirements to provide information under the 1971 Act or the 2006 Act fully understand the information they are required to provide, the time or times at which it should be provided and the form and manner in which the information should be provided and received. In doing so, they comply with the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/6">These measures are not about penalising carriers. The Government work with carriers to ensure the safety of their passengers and crew, the security of their aircraft, ships and trains and the security of the United Kingdom. However, there is a need for a civil penalty regime when carriers fail, without reasonable excuse, to comply with requirements of the authority to carry scheme. When a carrier fails to comply, we should have the ability to impose an appropriate penalty up to a maximum of &#163;50,000. That is particularly the case if the failure results in a carrier&#8217;s bringing someone to the</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/7">UK, or carrying someone from the UK, whom they had been or would have been expressly refused authority to carry. It is worth noting that these aspects of the regulations were not criticised by the Joint Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.549.1/8">The two communications data codes of practice outline best practice and ensure that the right safeguards are in place concerning access to, and retention of, communications data. It is important that we bring them into force by the end of this Parliament. The authority to carry scheme civil penalties regime will ensure that carriers comply with requirements imposed on them to prevent and disrupt travel by individuals who pose a threat to the public or, in the circumstances of children travelling to Syria, who are putting themselves at risk. I urge right hon. and hon. Members to approve these important statutory instruments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.550.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" speakername="Diana Johnson" colnum="550"  time="016:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0001.htm#150316-0001.htm_spnew136">
	<p pid="b.550.0/1">I should like to start by thanking the Minister for setting out clearly what is behind the three measures before us today. I particularly want to thank him for his remarks about the action being taken against those travelling to Iraq and Syria to become involved in terrorist activities. I am sure that the whole House will support the work that he and his Government are doing in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/2">I shall deal first with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Acquisition and Disclosure of Communications Data: Code of Practice) Order 2015. This reissued guidance has five laudable aims, which the Opposition support. They are: to enhance the operational independence of the authorising officer from involvement in the specific investigation for which communications data are required; to strengthen the protections for information that has professional sensitivity&#8212;particularly journalistic material; to reflect the additional requirements on local authorities to request communications data through a magistrate; to improve the record-keeping requirements for public authorities; and to improve best practice in regard to international co-operation and emergency calls.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/3">We support those aims in the guidance, but I should like to ask the Minister a few questions about how we have reached this point in the code of practice. First, the draft guidance was put out to consultation late last year. Why has the response to that consultation not been published for Parliament to consider alongside this statutory instrument? The Minister said that it had been published, but I have had real difficulty finding it. The Vote Office could not find it for me when I requested it, and it is not next to the other documents on the Home Office website, so could the Minister tell me where I can find it? As he said during the passage of the Serious Crime Bill, there were more than 300 responses to the consultation, and it would have been useful to be able to see them.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/4">Secondly, will the Minister explain the key difference between this guidance and that published just before Christmas? Thirdly, will he explain the timings of these changes? Why was a consultation launched while reports from the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, due out in a few weeks&#8217; time, and further recommendations from the interception of communications commissioner were expected? I appreciate that the changes reflect some earlier recommendations from the commissioner, and there have been subsequent changes to reflect new</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/5">recommendations, but why is the code of practice being treated almost like a work in progress? Why not have the recommendations first, then a full consultation and then a final code of conduct, with special interim measures, which I know we would probably all support, to protect journalistic sources? Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain how this process has worked.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/6">Will the Minister also explain how the code of conduct has been written to ensure that it accurately reflects recent legislative changes? First, I was thinking about the recent orders extending the grounds on which the Financial Conduct Authority can access data. Is all that covered in this code? Secondly, the Serious Crime Act 2015 implements some of the recommendations from the interception of communications commissioner. Although it is welcome that the guidance goes some way to reflecting those changes, with a page added to give specific protection to journalistic sources, the Act introduced only partial and interim measures, so I want to know from the Minister whether the guidance will need to be reissued again when the final legislative measures are introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/7">On the second order before us, I want to ask about the definition of &#8220;communication&#8221; and &#8220;message&#8221;, an area where the code of practice does not address many of the issues raised during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill, both in this House and in the other place, about how &#8220;communication&#8221; is defined. Paragraph 2.13 of the code of practice is very specific in relation to fixed-line telephony calls. That is fine as far as it goes, and it is probably all that was needed 20 or 30 years ago, but this code of practice is for 2015 and beyond. I am sure the Minister will accept that the way we communicate now is very different from when we just had fixed telephone lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/8">Fixed-line telephone calls now are a small element of communications. When we look at internet-based communications, from e-mail to app-based messaging and social media, we see that the code of conduct is too vague in what it is trying to do. Paragraph 2.11 refers readers of the code of practice back to section 2(1) of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 and to the schedule to that Act. I am not sure why a code of practice supposedly designed, to quote from the code, to be</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/9">&#8220;readily available to employees of a CSP&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/10">to use should refer them back to an obscure part of an Act that was criticised by some right hon. and hon. Members for not being as clear as it could be.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/11">Paragraph 2.16 is the only one I could find in the code of practice that seeks to explain what DRIPA means for internet-based communications. The paragraph is headed &#8220;Internet email&#8221; and states:</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/12">&#8220;Internet email under DRIPA is considered to be any text, voice, sound or image message sent over a public electronic communications network which can be stored in the network or in the recipient&#8217;s terminal equipment until it is collected by the recipient and includes messages sent using a short message service.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/13">Is that simply a definition of internet-based e-mail providers such as Hotmail or Gmail, or is it meant to include social media? If it is meant to include social media, why does it not say that, so it is clear in the code of practice?</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/14">In Committee, I asked a series of questions about social media, which the Minister did not answer, and I do not think they were answered in the other place either. Let me ask the Minister again: does the code of</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/15">practice include messages sent on social media platforms such as Facebook? If it does, why is there no section in the guidance devoted to social media? As I have said, the title &#8220;Internet e-mail&#8221; is not clear in this respect. If social media are covered, does a message extend to tagging another person in a broader post? Specifically, if a person is tagged in a Facebook or Instagram post, does that count as a message for the purposes of this code? What about a person included in a tweet? Does that count as well?</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/16">Perhaps the Minister will also respond to questions on the generic forms of interaction on social media sites. I am talking about where there is no user-generated content, but there is an interaction&#8212;for example, I &#8220;love&#8221; a photo on Instagram, &#8220;like&#8221; a post on Facebook, &#8220;favourite&#8221; a tweet, or &#8220;swipe&#8221; on Tinder. Do those come within this code of practice?</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/17">When I raised those issues in Committee, the Minister said that the code covered all communications, by which he meant anything that conveyed a message&#8212;as if a message was a self-evident thing that did not need a clear definition. That rather clumsy presumption has been applied to this code of conduct. Will the Minister explain, with reference to the social media sites, how paragraph 2.16 is meant to be interpreted? I hope he can shed some light on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/18">I also want to ask about the relationship that this code envisages between the Home Office and the communications service providers. For example, the code of practice gives the Secretary of State total discretion over the review of retention notices, but it says that factors leading to a review could include significant technological change. Can the Minister explain how an ongoing dialogue with the CSPs operates, and how it is being maintained to ensure that the Secretary of State will be aware of major technological changes?</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/19">Moving on, will the Minister explain why no impact assessment has been prepared for this legislation? Last week, we found that the impact assessment prepared for the Prevent elements of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill, vague and imprecise as they were, had not been signed off by the Home Office&#8217;s chief economist because the Home Office did not have the evidence base to support the legislation. Essentially, what that confirmed was that, after four years, the Home Office did not have that evidence about what works in terms of Prevent and so could not use that to inform and back up any legislative decisions. Is that the reason we do not have an impact assessment for the statutory instruments before us today? These codes of practice cover the process for decisions regarding compensation payments provided to CSPs, so they could have far-reaching cost and spending implications. They also have the potential to change significantly the compliance burdens on businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/20">I am very surprised that we do not have an impact assessment drafted for these orders. Perhaps the Minister can give us some background information; if he is not able to do so today, perhaps he could find it and place it in the Library. I have four questions. First, how many retention notices are currently in force, and how many are company-specific? Secondly, the code of practice talks about two years as the standard period for a review of a data retention notice. In practice, how many notices are reviewed before the two-year period? Thirdly, how many retention notices have been ended before the</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/21">two-year period? Fourthly, what is the total spend on compensation agreed with the communications service providers in each of the past five years?</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/22">The Government&#8217;s explanatory memorandum to the Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/23">&#8220;Full guidance will be provided to industry on the operation of the Scheme. The Home Office and other agencies will continue to engage with industry on the detail of the Scheme to assist implementation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/24">Will the Minister make it clear when he expects this guidance to be made available? The transport industry also made an observation in a number of responses to the consultation&#8212;I think that there were 28 in total. The memorandum states:</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/25">&#8220;The majority of carriers felt, however, that a proposed maximum fine of &#163;50,000 was excessive and disproportionate, especially when compared to the possible fines imposed by other countries.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/26">Will the Minister explain why, despite the view taken by the transport industry, the Government decided to maintain the upper limit of &#163;50,000 for a fine?</p>
	<p pid="b.550.0/27">Finally, I also note that the 21-day rule was breached for introducing those regulations. I hope that the Minister will comment on why. I am sure that he will make a commitment that every attempt will be made in future to ensure that orders are introduced within the appropriate time.</p>

	<p pid="b.553.0/1">I shall be brief. It seems clear that the House will approve the orders moved by the Minister today. He began by putting the situation and the reasons behind the orders in context. He knows, as Security Minister, that the country faces a severe threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.553.0/2">Last week, the Select Committee on Home Affairs, in one of our last sessions of this Parliament, heard the evidence of the relatives of Shamima, Amira and Khadiza, three young ladies aged 16, 15 and 15 who left Tower Hamlets and went to Syria. Only this morning, I met the families of two of the young men who have just returned from Istanbul. The families are wonderful people, hard working and dedicated to this country, and were as shocked as any of us would have been that their children had left the country and, in the case of the girls from Tower Hamlets, reached Syria and, in the case of the three young men, been brought back yesterday. I commend the police for their work, and the Turkish authorities in the latter case.</p>
	<p pid="b.553.0/3">The Turkish ambassador gave us very good evidence last week, with a timeline. The situation was much better second time around, with phone calls being made instead of e-mails being sent. We need to commend people when things go right and this is a good news story in the fight against terrorism. We do not have many of them, but everyone worked together and we commend them for what they are doing.</p>

	<p pid="b.553.1/1">I am sure that we would all endorse what my right hon. Friend says and what the Minister said about the Turkish police and ensuring that the young people involved were returned to this country immediately. I cannot go</p>
	<p pid="b.553.1/2">further than that, as the Minister has stated. Does my right hon. Friend agree that we need to probe further, even though the numbers are very small, and ask why it is that young people like those he mentioned, whose relatives we saw in the Home Affairs Committee last week, should wish to join a group motivated by mass murder, savage beatings, beheadings and sex slavery? More needs to be done to find the reasons that such youngsters, born and educated in this country, should wish to travel in the way they intended.</p>

	<p pid="b.554.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Committee has taken evidence from all the stakeholders involved, but it is the people who have gone abroad who really matter as we need to find out why they went in the first place. We need to get into their minds in some way, as he has said and as his questions in the Committee&#8217;s evidence sessions have tried to do, to find out why they make that decision, what turns them and what the tipping point is. They are brought up in this country, and by parents who obviously love and support them, but then suddenly they decide to go abroad. If I have one regret from all my years of chairing the Committee, it is that we have never been able to take evidence directly from those who have gone abroad. Some have come back, of course, but they are reluctant to talk to us, either formally or informally. My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and I think that why people decide to go is something that successor Committees and the next Parliament will have to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.554.0/2">On the orders before the House, I fully support the instrument that brings into force the code of practice to enhance safeguards and ensure clear guidance on best practice with regard to the acquisition and retention of communications data. When the Committee took evidence from journalists on the matter&#8212;this is in the public domain, of course&#8212;we said that we believed there ought to be exceptions. The Government accept that the authorities need to be very careful when they stray into areas relating to freedom of the press. I think that the code does provide for that, so the Government are right to bring it before the House now rather than at some later date.</p>
	<p pid="b.554.0/3">However, the Committee, in looking at the regulations before the House, strongly suggested that RIPA&#8217;s days had come and gone. Although it was acceptable at the time to pass that legislation, we felt that, frankly, it was being misused. Anecdotally, we have head about some local authorities using the powers in RIPA to spy on families deciding where to send their children to school. We felt that such misuse was probably going on in other areas, but we did not know because there was no proper and effective monitoring.</p>

	<p pid="b.555.0/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/2">I think the Minister has done an excellent job in bringing on side some of us who were not as supportive of these proposals as others, but I am still concerned about the number of organisations that will be able to use DRIPA to access information. Does the right hon. Gentleman know how many such organisations there are?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.555.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="555"  time="016:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0001.htm#150316-0001.htm_spnew145">
	<p pid="b.555.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to be wary of that. I do not know how many other organisations can do that, and I think that there is a lack of monitoring. When Parliament passes legislation for a specific purpose and it is then used for other purposes&#8212;journalists say that this could be used to spy on them, for example, thereby giving up vital information about sources&#8212;parliamentarians need to pause and reconsider, and I think that is what we have to do. As he will know, given his great experience in home affairs matters, having in a previous life been so intimate with the workings of the Liverpool passport office, the state&#8217;s use of these powers does tend to creep. We need to ensure that we are vigilant in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.1/2">The Minister says that he is waiting for David Anderson to report. One way of ensuring that David Anderson does a quicker job is to give him more resources. One of the things the Select Committee has noted is that the independent assessor does not have the kinds of resources that we would have expected. If the Government&#8212;whoever is in power after <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-07">7 May</phrase>&#8212;help him along his path, we may be able to get a result much more quickly. We would therefore get the review of RIPA, which I think the whole House wants. The Prime Minister certainly wants it, from what I have heard him say about it. I hope we will be able to move that forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.1/3">Finally, on the last set of regulations before the House, the Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015, I have no problem in principle with what the Minister proposes, but he told the House, in effect, that the situation in which these would take effect has never arisen&#8212;that a carrier, having been asked not to carry, has defied Government, either in-bound or out-bound, and said, &#8220;We are going to carry this person.&#8221; It was the previous Government who introduced the carriers&#8217; liability regulations. I probably voted for the measure at the time&#8212;I cannot remember as it was so long ago. It was effective because the carrier tends not to put someone on a plane if that person has been told on departure from another country that they do not have the requisite visa to enter the United Kingdom, as it is the carrier that will pay the fine.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.1/4">There is nothing wrong with the principle, but we should legislate when we know that there is a problem. We finally got out of the Minister the fact that there has never been a situation where that has happened, so here we are, passing legislation to stop something that has never happened. His argument is that it is important to have that power in the back pocket because we never know when we might need it. It is important for the Minister to be able to wave it in front of carriers and say, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t do this, you will be fined.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.555.1/5">My objection to civil penalties is that the amount collected by the Government is lamentably small. To save us having to table parliamentary questions, as we are right at the end of this Parliament and we might not get the answers before we rise, I hope that the Minister will give us some figures when he winds up showing the percentage of civil penalty fines that have not been paid by those who are subject to them. I think unpaid fines owed to the Home Office will run into millions of pounds. The last time I looked, it was a pretty high figure.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.1/6">All I ask the Minister to do is to reassure the House that he is a good collector of those penalties&#8212;not the hon. Gentleman personally, but his Department. I am sure that if he knocked on my door and asked for the penalty to be paid, I would pay it immediately. He is such a nice and charming man that I would cough up immediately, but we cannot spare the Minister for Security and Immigration for that kind of work. Others have to do it, or sometimes it is done by letter. All that happens is that the letter is put to one side. Perhaps he will have the figure for the amount of uncollected civil penalties currently owed to the Home Office. If it does not run into millions, I will buy him dinner in the Members Dining Room before the House rises on <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-30">30 March</phrase>. On that cheerful note, I will finish my contribution.</p>

	<p pid="b.556.0/1">I will not delay the House more than a minute. Over the past 12 months I have bored the House enough, like a needle on a cracked record, on the subject of the protection of journalists.</p>
	<p pid="b.556.0/2">That started with a debate on the concerns expressed by the National Union of Journalists about the volume of production orders that were being used against its members, as well as the range of organisations using and abusing RIPA, and the police moving away from PACE to avoid accountability through the courts, and then using RIPA. In addition, concerns were expressed by the NUJ about the development of DRIPA.</p>
	<p pid="b.556.0/3">I am grateful to the Minister for allowing the interchange of views between the NUJ and his officials. That has helped us to move forward clearly on the codes of practice, but those do not go far enough, nor do these regulations, to meet the NUJ&#8217;s position on the protection of journalistic sources. However, the draft clauses have been published. We are about to go into purdah. Whoever is in government after the election will have to address the issue fairly quickly, as the Minister knows. Can the lines of communication between the civil servants and the NUJ remain open during this period? Also, can further meetings take place with the NUJ&#8217;s legal advisers and the NUJ representatives to ensure that the eventual legislation, or the advice on the eventual legislation, that goes before the incoming Ministers will meet with the approval of all stakeholders, as well as journalists?</p>

	<p pid="b.556.1/1">With the leave of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker, I will try to respond to as many as possible of the various points that have been raised during this helpful debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.556.1/2">Let me at the outset welcome the support that right hon. and hon. Members have given to these statutory instruments, even if, in a number of cases, they feel that</p>
	<p pid="b.556.1/3">further work may be required. Further debate and discussion is taking place about the communications data aspects and the report by David Anderson. I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, that David Anderson remains on course to report on time before <phrase class="date" code="2015-05-01">1 May</phrase>. I underline the fact that the new privacy and civil liberties oversight board will give further support to David Anderson in his important work, which the right hon. Gentleman and many others in the House recognise in terms of the contribution that he makes.</p>
	<p pid="b.556.1/4">The right hon. Gentleman highlighted the case of the three schoolgirls who travelled from London to Syria and the evidence that his Committee took last week. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specifics of that recent case, not least because the investigation is still ongoing. He rightly underlines the huge distress that is caused to families by these cases. We hope that this matter can be resolved and that the girls are able to return home to their families as soon as possible. I know that the whole House would wish to underline that.</p>
	<p pid="b.556.1/5">There are continuing issues on which we need to challenge ourselves as regards why people seek to travel in this way. As the evidence that has been provided to various Committees indicates, it is a complicated picture featuring the impact of social media, peers, and other influences. That is why, as a Government, we have taken a very broad view in recognising the responsibilities that we all hold in seeking to prevent people from travelling and becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. We will be able to return to this again next week, I hope, when we look at further instruments and guidance that may need to be considered further before the House rises.</p>

	<p pid="b.557.0/1">I look forward to looking at the Minister&#8217;s further instruments when they become available for scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.0/2">On the point about communities and families, having looked carefully at this subject, the lesson that the Committee has learned over the past 10 days is that they should not be afraid to come forward and speak to the authorities, because the authorities will deal with them sympathetically and they will not be stigmatised. We are all in this together to fight those who seek to seduce and groom young men and women and take them out of our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.557.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a very important point that I entirely endorse. Indeed, that is why the Home Office has been keen to support initiatives such as that advanced by Families Against Stress and Trauma, which has campaigned to highlight the need to come forward and report to the authorities or to others who may be able to take action to safeguard and prevent such actions.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> raised again the position of journalists in relation to communications data. He and I have rightly debated that on a number of occasions in this House. He, and others, may not feel that this is the final settled picture. As I have said, we recognise that this matter needs to be further regularised in primary legislation,</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/3">and we hope that the House will be able to return to it swiftly after the general election. In his report, the commissioner said that there had been no abuse, in relation to his investigations and his inquiry, into the manner in which communications data requests are made of journalists. I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s suggestion that we should ensure that there is continuing dialogue on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/4">The draft clauses, and our desire to receive feedback on them, provide a further opportunity for those channels to be kept open. Although the House will head into purdah and Dissolution shortly, I hope communication will be maintained with officials to ensure that, when this House returns, the next Government can to move forward quickly in the light not only of David Anderson&#8217;s report, but of the feedback we receive on the draft clauses. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/5">I will go through as many as possible of the points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase>, whose broad support I welcome. As the explanatory notes make clear, a full regulatory impact assessment was made of the effect of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 and the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/6">On the difference between the consultative code and the final version, the key changes include the introduction of the requirements for law enforcement to use the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to acquire communications data in order to determine journalistic sources. Other changes include greater clarity on the additional consideration for those in sensitive professions and increased guidance on the necessity and proportionality that must be met by all applications for communications data. I assure the hon. Lady that we reflected carefully on the submissions. The codes reflect all recent primary legislation, but, as she will appreciate, if significant changes are made to primary legislation in the future, new codes may be required.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/7">We do not provide details of which companies are the subject of data retention notices or the detail of those notices, as it could be of considerable benefit to terrorists and other criminals if they knew which companies were under the data retention obligations, and they could adjust their behaviour accordingly. That is why we have maintained a consistent stance.</p>
	<p pid="b.557.1/8">The responses to the public consultation have been published on the Home Office website and we have written to the Chairs of the relevant parliamentary Committees. I am sorry if the hon. Lady was not able to locate them and I am happy to write to her to point her directly to them, because I specifically made sure that they were published in advance of today&#8217;s debate. I am disappointed that she has not been able to locate them, which is what I wanted her to be able to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.558.0/1">I am grateful that the Minister will write to me, but I made strenuous efforts to get hold of the responses, including getting the Vote Office to look for them and having a good search of the Home Office website myself.

	<p pid="b.558.1/1">All I can say is that the consultation responses were published. I note the hon. Lady&#8217;s challenge and I will certainly point her in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.558.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2015-02-04">4 February</phrase> the interception of communications commissioner reported on the issue of journalists&#8217; material. We are introducing the codes as quickly as possible to give as full effect as we can to the commissioner&#8217;s recommendations. Frankly, we do not believe it would be appropriate to wait. The hon. Lady asked why we are doing it now and in this way. It is being done in this way to ensure that the codes and safeguards are put in place as quickly as possible. I judged that it was right to do the initial consultation and get feedback even though we knew that the commissioner was due to report, because if we had waited for the commissioner&#8217;s response and then done a full consultation on the full code, we would not be in the position we are in today. I think that was the right approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.558.1/3">The hon. Lady also asked technical questions about social media. The provisions apply to relevant communications data generated or processed in the UK by communications service providers. The codes of practice give some examples of the data to be retained and the way in which the CSPs build their systems. The communications data generated differ among CSPs and the services they provide. It is important that the Government can work with providers to ensure that appropriate data are retained. The code provides that the Home Office may give further guidance to those implementing the requirements. In other words, there can be further drill-down to give further specificity. The Home Office works closely with providers to ensure that it is aware of future technological changes that may lead to a review of a data retention notice. I will reflect further on the points made by the hon. Lady and place any additional information in the Library.</p>
	<p pid="b.558.1/4">Finally, the &#163;50,000 maximum penalty for failing to comply with the requirement under the authority to carry scheme reflects the seriousness attached to a carrier bringing someone into the UK or taking someone out of the UK when refused the authority to do so. I certainly hear the point made by the right hon. Member for Leicester East when he asked why we should have a penalty if compliance is already enforced. Now that we are extending the scheme to both in-bound and out-bound carrying, having looked at different aspects of it under the code and reflected on the issues raised, it is appropriate to have a penalty or sanction to encourage and promote</p>
	<p pid="b.558.1/5">the positive behaviour that right hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North and I want. We have brought in the penalty in that spirit.</p>

	<p pid="b.561.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That the draft Drug Driving (Specified Limits) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2015, which were laid before this House on <phrase class="date" code="2015-02-05">5 February</phrase>, be approved.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/3">The instrument will include amphetamine, with a limit of 250 micrograms per litre of blood, in the new drug-driving offence of driving with a specified drug in the body above a specified limit. The new offence was provided for in the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which inserted new section 5A into the Road Traffic Act 1988. The Drug Driving (Specified Limits) (England and Wales) Regulations 2014, made on <phrase class="date" code="2014-10-24">24 October 2014</phrase>, specified 16 other drugs and their limits, and the new offence came into force in England and Wales on <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-02">2 March</phrase>. Indeed, the first arrest was on that very day. I recognise the positive engagement and support of the Opposition in introducing the new regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/4">As hon. Members are aware, the review of drink and drug-driving law by Sir Peter North concluded that there was</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/5">&#8220;a significant drug driving problem&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/6">and recommended the new offence. It also recommended the inclusion of amphetamine. The expert panel on drug-driving, in its report of March 2013, also recommended the inclusion of amphetamine in the new drug-driving offence. It quoted the European driving under the influence of drugs, alcohol and medicines project&#8212;the so-called DRUID project&#8212;which suggested that amphetamine caused a medium to high risk of a traffic accident. The DRUID researchers did not find an impairment effect at therapeutic doses, but a negative driving performance could be detected at high doses.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/7">As hon. Members are probably aware, the Government have considered carefully what the appropriate level should be for amphetamine. The expert panel recommended a limit of 600 micrograms per litre of blood if our approach was to look at when the risk of a road traffic collision was most likely to occur. However, although there is significant medicinal use of amphetamine, the Government were concerned about the amount of illegal use. The expert panel described it as &#8220;an illicit substance&#8221; and</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/8">&#8220;a long standing member of the drug scene&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/9">The approach to setting a limit for the drug was therefore not as clear-cut as for the other drugs, because a zero tolerance approach was taken to illegal drugs such as cannabis and cocaine, whereas a road safety risk approach was taken to drugs that were more associated with medicinal use.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/10">The Government used the consultation in summer 2013 to seek further views and evidence on what a suitable limit might be. Many of the responses proposed a limit that was much closer to the zero tolerance approach, so we re-consulted on a limit of 50 micrograms per litre from December 2013 to the end of January 2014. However, we received several objections from the medical profession to the proposed limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/11">Specialists in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, for which amphetamine is a recognised treatment, argued that the condition affects the ability</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/12">to concentrate and that, although patients represent an increased road safety risk when unmedicated, they are just as safe as the general population when taking their medication. Those respondents backed up their arguments with research. Their concern was that prescribers and ADHD patients must not be discouraged from prescribing medication or taking it. We recognise that adult ADHD often goes undiagnosed and that treatment is often stopped after people have had it as a child. That presents road safety risks that need to be addressed through treatment. We concluded that the limit of 50 micrograms that we initially proposed might discourage those with ADHD from seeking or continuing with treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/13">To be clear, the amphetamine treatment for ADHD that we are talking about is not Ritalin, which is often associated with ADHD. Although similar to amphetamine, Ritalin is a methylphenidate. Amphetamine drugs, including lisdexamfetamine, which is produced by Shire pharmaceuticals, tend to be used as a second-line treatment when methylphenidate is not successful.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/14">It is therefore appropriate to set a limit that is above the therapeutic range that ADHD sufferers are most likely to be prescribed and below the level that is most likely to be the result of people abusing the medication. After holding extensive informal discussions with specialists in ADHD and the Secretary of State&#8217;s honorary medical advisory panel on alcohol, drugs and substance misuse and driving, we have agreed that 250 micrograms per litre of blood is the most appropriate limit. The advisory panel quoted the analysis of 2,995 blood samples that were taken between 2008 and 2012 across the UK in suspected drug-driving cases, which showed an average concentration of amphetamine of 456 micrograms per litre of blood. The Government concluded from their consultation with the ADHD specialists and the advisory panel that the level of 250 micrograms would successfully balance the legitimate use of amphetamine for medicinal purposes against its abuse by those who represent a risk on the road as a result of taking it.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/15">The House may recall that in September last year, during the debate on the regulations that specified the 16 other drugs and their limits, the Government indicated that they intended to re-consult on a limit for amphetamine. Given the extensive discussions that we have held with medical stakeholders, we take the view that we have had sufficient opportunity to consider the views of all the relevant parties and that conducting a third formal consultation on a limit for amphetamine is no longer appropriate or necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/16">The new drug-driving offence commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2015-03-02">2 March</phrase>, and the Government believe it important that amphetamine is added to the list of drugs as soon as possible, so that those who abuse amphetamine and continue to drive and put lives at risk can expect to be caught and prosecuted for the new offence. I acknowledge that there is no roadside screening device for amphetamine&#8212;currently only cannabis and cocaine have an approved device that tests saliva&#8212;but should there be any suspicion of the consumption of that drug or any other specified drug, a blood test can be carried out, and a blood concentration level above the specified limit will result in prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/17">Specifying amphetamine will create certainty in the market and enable manufacturers to consider the research and development of roadside screeners for that drug, which is one of the most significant in drug-driving</p>
	<p pid="b.561.1/18">cases. I urge right hon. and hon. Members to support extending the regulations to include amphetamine at the limit proposed, to send a strong message that the House, Parliament and wider society will not tolerate those who persist in drug-driving and the threat they pose to other road users. I recommend that the House approve these regulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.563.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow the Minister on this subject. He and I may have a sense that, if not groundhog day, it is perhaps groundhog piglet day because&#8212;he alluded to this&#8212;we discussed the closely related draft Crime and Courts Act 2013 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2015 only last Monday. I will therefore do my best to focus specifically on the amphetamine aspects of today&#8217;s debate, although as the Minister demonstrated, some points may overlay with the broader discussion from last Monday.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/2">The Minister has rightly said that the order confirms the limit for amphetamines in the new drug-driving legislation&#8212;indeed, amphetamine was the only drug that the Government did not confirm the limits for in October 2014&#8212;and he spelt out in some detail and with considerable clarity the iterative process that led to the Government proposing that limit. I understand that, and the Minister dealt manfully with the various chemical substances that were referred to, and in the process he gave the House a useful insight into the risk-benefit analysis that must take place in such areas&#8212;I hesitate to call it a master class, but it was informative and useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/3">I want to raise one or two points with the Minister, although as he will know the Opposition strongly support the broad thrust of these regulations and the previous ones. I do not propose to quote in detail from last week&#8217;s discussion, but he will recall that when I asked why the consultations on amphetamine limits had been cancelled, he replied that he thought the balance achieved was absolutely right. Today, he has given chapter and verse on that process and why he thought the third consultation was no longer necessary. However, that does not explain why the Department for Transport originally proposed to re-consult on the amphetamine limit, if it was already holding extensive discussions with medical stakeholders that it now says makes such consultation unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/4">Will the Minister clarify why the Department said in September that the consultation would take place, only to announce in March that it will not? If we had had an earlier statement, would there not have been ample time for a formal consultation to be held and still make the order today? I make that point not in a spirit of churlishness or to be slightly anorak, but because it is essential to have a broad breadth of consultation and agreement on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/5">Will the Minister update the House on why, as amphetamine has to be treated differently from other illegal drugs, the advice of his own expert panel, which originally recommended 600 micrograms of amphetamine per litre of blood, was set aside?</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/6">I want to touch on the 50 microgram limit arrived at in the proposal. Will the Minister explain again, for the benefit of the House and Members who may not have been present at the more general discussion of the</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/7">previous order, how this argument relates to the level set for the eight drugs used for medicinal purposes? Does that not perhaps occasionally undermine the Government&#8217;s continued statement that the medical defence provided to drivers on prescription drugs will be enough to ensure they will not be discouraged from seeking treatment?</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/8">On a previous occasion, I alluded to the fact that the essential element is not simply the passing of an order, but the ability to enforce it and the resources to go with that enforcement process. I do not propose to repeat the concerns we raised last week. However, the Minister made much of the fact that, although the main screening in police stations was going to cost about &#163;3,000, 35 of the 42 police authorities&#8212;if I have the figures right&#8212;already had them, so I was not to be too concerned about the postcode lottery issue, which I had raised. He also said that the roadside tests for these substances, the so-called use-once Drugwipe device or the electronic Dr&#228;ger device, would be available, quoting the figure of &#163;20.</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/9">On enforcement, the Minister&#8217;s hon. Friend in the other place said that in most cases it was not necessary for this to be done in the station, but on roadside screening devices. However, she also said that it was up to manufacturers to market them and the police to purchase them. It is therefore still by no means certain that roadside screening for drugs will become routine across the country. How has this significant uncertainty been factored into the Government&#8217;s estimates of how many more convictions for the offence there will be, how many crashes may be prevented and how many lives may be saved?</p>
	<p pid="b.563.0/10">We join the Government&#8212;and, I think, all Members&#8212;in wanting the new regulations to be imposed as speedily and effectively as possible. It is therefore incumbent on the Government to ensure, insofar as is humanly possible, that the resources and quality of enforcement across the country are adequate and sufficient.</p>

	<p pid="b.564.0/1">I served on the Committee that considered the related order. I should like to put on record my appreciation to successive Governments for legislation that has resulted in the number of deaths on our roads being today approximately one third what it was 50 years ago. The regulations are a step along the road of reducing that number still further.</p>
	<p pid="b.564.0/2">We all need to emphasise that we are talking here about drugs in the round: drugs prescribed for medicinal purposes and existing illegal drugs. We need to ensure that people who are prescribed drugs realise that they could, just possibly, be in breach of the law. We need to stress that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.564.0/3">I do have a regret. As we approached the 2010 general election, we were looking forward to a reduction in the level of alcohol with which people were allowed to drive legally. Unfortunately, that was never implemented, so the drink-drive limit in England is still too high. I hope that the Minister will indicate whether the next Government might want to reduce it.</p>
	<p pid="b.564.0/4">I welcome the measure, but I stress again the importance of getting the message across that we are talking about drugs prescribed for medicinal purposes and that people need to ensure that they do not break the law unwittingly. The message should be, &#8220;If in doubt, don&#8217;t risk it.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.565.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40093" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Blackpool South (Mr Marsden)</phrase> for raising several questions, some of which we covered in Committee last week. He asked why we did not re-consult on the level. Although we decided that 50 micrograms was not the correct limit at the end of March 2014, we had to consult informally with a range of medical experts to ensure we got the number right, and that took time. Most importantly, we are confident that 250 micrograms is correct, as it successfully balances the legitimate use of amphetamine for medical purposes against its abuse by those who represent a risk on the road as a result of its use. Given our extensive discussions with medical stakeholders, we think that we have had sufficient opportunity to consider the views of all relevant parties and that conducting a third formal consultation on the limit for amphetamine use is no longer appropriate or necessary. No additional significant risk is associated with going from 50 micrograms to 250 micrograms, as advised by the Secretary of State&#8217;s advisory panel.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.0/2">Importantly, the level we have set for the eight illegal drugs effectively represents a zero-tolerance approach. We have set the level sufficiently high so that there can be no opportunity for loophole lawyers to get people off or for people to use the defence that they were accidentally exposed to drugs by, for example, sitting next to somebody who was smoking cannabis or handling an item that had been used for cocaine.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.0/3">It is important to remind the House that existing legislation on impairment remains on the statute book, and many prescribed drugs will carry a warning indicating that people should not take them if they feel drowsy or their vision is blurred. That has not changed, so people taking prescription drugs below the levels set in the regulations will still be committing an offence if they are impaired. If they take levels above those set in the regulations, but are not impaired, they will have the medical defence. The advice has gone out to pharmacists, doctors and patients that if necessary they should carry evidence of their prescription as a medical defence.</p>

	<p pid="b.565.1/1">I want to make a point about notices on prescription drugs. Many years ago, the message that cigarettes were harmful to health would have been smaller and much less obvious than it became. That seems to apply now to prescription drugs. Does the Minister have a view on whether the message about the danger of taking prescription drugs, even below the levels he has mentioned, should be much more obvious to users?</p>

	<p pid="b.565.2/1">We have issued specific advice to pharmacists on the nine drugs we are specifying, but there is a general warning to patients as well that taking prescription drugs can affect them. In the case of the</p>
	<p pid="b.565.2/2">drugs specified in the regulations, we have issued stickers to pharmacists and doctors to provide an additional reminder.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.2/3">On the cost of screening, it is true that although a breathalyser now costs about 17p to administer at the roadside&#8212;we now have breathalysers that are evidential&#8212;the cost of these new roadside tests will be about &#163;20. Of course, we want more competition in the market in terms of the number of devices available and the number of drugs that can be detected. As we get more competition and more players in the market, the cost will come down. I am sure that police forces and police and crime commissioners will take decisions based on where this equipment is deployed. Even if it is not in every police car, it will be important, particularly for fatal or near-fatal accidents, that the equipment is available, to ensure that a screening test can be quickly taken. Of course, if the two drugs that we can currently test for are not detected, there will be the option of going to the police station to take the test there. The blood test, not the roadside test, will form the basis of the prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.2/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" name="Bob Russell">the Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell)</phrase> said that this is a further step made by the Government towards improving road safety. Personally, I am pleased that we have now reached, I hope, the end of the road on this; I personally insisted that the issue should be put in the Conservative manifesto at the last general election. With a couple of weeks to go, we have finally got the matter completed and on the statute book.</p>
	<p pid="b.565.2/5">Drink-drive limits were mentioned. I shall not be tempted to speak at great length on that issue because it is not within the terms of today&#8217;s debate, but it will be interesting to take account of the experience in Scotland. It is important to note that when the drink-driving legislation came in, many people thought that drink-driving was acceptable, but we subsequently saw a great cultural change take place on this issue. If we read about the horrendous accidents that occur because of drink-driving, we often find that the driver was three or even four times above the existing limit. As I say, it will be interesting to see how things develop in Scotland. We will, of course, keep everything under review. I conclude my comments there.</p>

I think that the summary dismissal of every single one of the amendments is symptomatic of not only TfL&#8217;s attitude but the faults in the Bill, which is why I have added my name to a number of the amendments.</p>

That is why the amendments have been drafted very specifically on the basis of the views expressed in the Opposed Private Bill Committee, which were not fully taken into account following the Committee&#8217;s recommendations. I had to draft the amendments, in consultation with some of the petitioners, to ensure that I captured their main concerns.</p>

I thought there were issues on which we could have had compromise; the main thrust of the first group of amendments is to secure openness, transparency and, most importantly, a consultative decision-making process. I have sat down with each of the petitioners. The whole point of these amendments is the need for consultative engagement by TfL and its subsidiaries when dealing with sites in their areas.</p>

I do not think anyone objects to sustainable responsible development by TfL, but this Bill permits not that type of development, but the type that I have seen in my constituency&#8212;irresponsible development that is in hock to developers and that, to use the parallel with the Heathrow proposal, can lead to huge damage to communities: 750 homes would be destroyed in my constituency as part of the Earls Court development, similar to the number in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, as a consequence of the third runway.</p>

	<p pid="b.570.5/1">That is it exactly. That is what new clause 1 seeks to address to a certain extent, as I will come on to. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase> has got a valid point, however, in mentioning concerns about antipathy to investment in London and that we need a balance in terms of non-London infrastructure investment and infrastructure investment in London. However, I do not think that this Bill solves that&#8212;in fact, I do not think it even addresses it. It makes matters worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.5/2">The prime principle behind this group of amendments is accountability. Why are those key elements of openness, transparency, a consultative decision-making process and accountability so important to the petitioners who have come to us and so important to our constituents who have raised these matters with us&#8212;the genesis of these amendments? It is because the Bill extends the power of TfL&#8212;and, via TfL, the Mayor of London&#8217;s power&#8212;to use an immense range and quantity of assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.5/3">Members may wish to correct me on this, but when we last asked how many sites could be identified as being such assets, I think the figure I was told was about 3,000 sites in the ownership or control of TfL. As a result of this legislation, those sites could be used for the placement of charges and mortgages to guarantee indemnity, and therefore for borrowing to raise funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.5/4">We will come to the other issue to arise from these amendments largely in the second block of amendments, but it relates to the first block as well. It is the concern about the vehicles that will be used, or which are proposed in this legislation. It is why new clause 1 is so crucial to the way forward. There are concerns about the range of vehicles, from the limited partnerships, which I think are the most worrying vehicle, as identified in the evidence to the Opposed Private Bill Committee, to the limited liability partnerships.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.5/5">What we have in the Bill, and what this group of amendments addresses, is potentially the largest use for generations of public assets in the capital to raise funds. It amounts to an immense mortgaging of London&#8217;s future, but also, more dangerously, as has been put to us in discussion after discussion with the regional petitioners, it opens up what one has described as a speculators&#8217; bonanza in our capital city. New clause 1 would address that to some extent, as would the other amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.5/6">The Bill puts at risk the finances of Transport for London, as well as its operations and its supply of transport services to London, including the tubes, the buses and even, I have to say, the Boris bikes. In the event of the catastrophic failure of some of what can only be described as the Mayor of London&#8217;s escapades, the burden would fall on London fare payers, London council tax payers, London business rate payers and, eventually, the general taxpayer. That is the risk behind this legislation if it goes through unamended tonight, and this group of new clauses and amendments has been tabled to ensure that we have a proper debate. I hope that the legislation will not go through unamended, but if it does, the new clauses and amendments will at least form the agenda for a dialogue between our communities and their elected representatives and Transport for London.</p>

	<p pid="b.571.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a powerful case. The Bill as currently drafted will be bad for the fare payer, and for the taxpayer in general, but it is also likely to be bad for those who work for Transport for London and for the communities in which the developments are likely to take place. This extraordinary cocktail of poor ideas is being pushed through, and I am not surprised to hear him say that it is being done in an atmosphere of secrecy.</p>

	<p pid="b.571.1/1">I come at this objectively, without any party political motivation. I am sure that the hon. Member for Harrow East and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will remember when the last Government imposed the public-private partnership on London, the GLA and the then Mayor. At that point, a few of us in this House warned that it would put at risk the future of London Transport if it was forced on it, and it nearly did. This Bill has the same dangerous implications. I remember the debates on the PPP, and I think I was the first Member of Parliament to raise those concerns in the House. I urged</p>
	<p pid="b.571.1/2">new Labour, as it then was, to pull back. The then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, sought to ensure that the PPP would not be imposed. I have tabled new clause 1 to try to ensure that we do not go down the same route.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.1/3">Members will remember that the scale of the PPP extended to &#163;3 billion. That was the extent of the bail-out as a result of that poor legislation being imposed on the then Mayor of London against his wishes and, I believe, against the wishes of the GLA on a cross-party basis. We subsequently discovered that the cost of the imposition of that &#163;3 billion was &#163;400 million in accountancy and consultancy fees alone. That money was wasted, and it was an absolute scandal. The Bill that we are discussing tonight will have the same implications if we cannot amend it. I do not say this with any arrogance, but those of us who opposed the PPP were proved absolutely right, and I believe that we will be proved right about this Bill if it is allowed to go through unamended.</p>

	<p pid="b.572.0/1">My hon. Friend does not need to speculate&#8212;if I may use that word&#8212;about the outcome of this Bill. He has already been proved right by the scheme that is the begetter of the Bill, the Earls Court and West Kensington scheme. It is demonstrably a terrible deal for the taxpayer and the fare payer, yet it is being used as the basis for institutionalising that type of development in legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.572.1/1">I agree. It was with some sadness that I listened to the representations of the opponents of the Bill when they presented their petitions to the Opposed Private Bill Committee and, more importantly, when they held an open meeting in this House to explain the consequences of the scheme for their homes, their businesses and their environment. It was a scandal. The problem is exactly as has been described, which is why new clause 1 is so crucial and why we have tabled amendments to the scheme. As Transport for London said in its letter to the general secretary of RMT, Mick Cash, if this legislation had been in place this vehicle would have been used for that scheme. This vehicle, under this legislation, would have been more precarious than even the existing arrangements under the Earls Court scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.572.2/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. It has not stopped TfL selling a majority interest in the site for a minority stake; and it has not stopped TfL going into a partnership where the fare payer takes all the risks and the developer takes none, and the developer is indeed represented by a &#163;2 company that, for tax-avoidance reasons, is domiciled in Jersey. But at least we know some of the facts of that case. The deal before us is the type that TfL wishes to make the norm, rather than the exception, and wishes to hide from public scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="b.572.3/1">I absolutely concur, and I do not need to labour the point. All I can say to the hon. Member for Harrow East, with whom we have worked over the years on a range of issues in the interests of London, is that if this legislation goes through without my new clause 1 and the subsequent set of amendments, it will make the PPP look like an accounting blip. The Bill is extremely dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="b.572.3/2">In addition to the financial risks involved in what some have described as a speculator&#8217;s charter, we face another potential loss. The mortgaging and development of sites could, in some cases, result in a loss of assets, particularly the land sites essential or invaluable to the future development of the improvement of London&#8217;s transport network and services.</p>

	<p pid="b.574.3/1">I am very, very grateful for that protection, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.574.3/2">Let me make my final general point about this group of amendments, because the next group contains some technical details in which we will need to involve ourselves. Decisions made by Transport for London may, if this Bill is enacted, result in sites being lost to private developers that could, at a later stage, be judged essential for future transport improvements. That is the view expressed to me by people working on the front line at London transport&#8212;I am talking about RMT and other union representatives. The cost of retrieving those sites, even through compulsory purchase powers and arrangements, would then fall on the fare payers, the council tax payers, London businesses and, eventually, the general taxpayers. If this Bill goes through unamended, it will not just create enormous financial risk but put at risk the long-term development of our transport infrastructure and reduce the flexibility of Transport for London to improve services in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.574.3/3">Let me turn now to the detail of the individual clauses. I wish to indicate now that, at some stage, I would like to press new clause 1 to a vote. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North is concerned about a whole batch of amendments, and I believe that the House should also take a view on amendment 29.</p>
	<p pid="b.574.3/4">In the context of the potential enormity of the scale of charging on TfL subsidiary assets&#8212;that is, the mortgaging of these assets&#8212;and the extent of the partnerships, limited or otherwise, it is important that Transport for London and, indeed, the Mayor are absolutely open about their intentions to enter into ventures for the development of these assets. That was clearly put to us time and again by the petitioners and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.574.3/5">New clause 1 contains a come-clean list and tries to ensure that people are fully informed of the Mayor&#8217;s intentions. It requires Transport for London to publish a list of non-operational assets that it holds&#8212;I will come back to the definition of non-operational because it is a slippery one that could be used in many forms in the future if we do not tie it down very tightly&#8212;or that are in the hands of a subsidiary, which it regards as eligible for development, and to band them by value.</p>

Friend has often had occasion to wonder who owns particular pieces of land. That may be for any reason to do with public nuisance, neglect, development or other matters. Should TfL not be publishing a full list of its assets, including operational and non-operational assets, whether or not they are ready for development?</p>

	<p pid="b.575.1/1">Somewhere deep in the heart of TfL&#8217;s offices, there will be a list. It is not a list that has been published in this form. Individual community groups, passenger groups and trade unions have been pressing for a clear list showing TfL&#8217;s intentions for those sites.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> to consider another example? Archway tower, next to Archway station, was built by London Transport in 1967, and the building was rapidly leased to the Department of Social Security and various other Departments. The building has now been sub-leased several times over, and a long lease has been purchased by a company called Essential Living to convert into 120 luxury flats. We thus have 120 luxury flats adjoining a tube station with no consideration whatever having been given to the housing needs of people in the area, yet we are apparently powerless to do anything about it.</p>

I have tried it. When some of the assets have been identified, we need to link the individual assets to the Mayor of London&#8217;s strategy and plan, going down from the macro policy to the micro level, to find out what will happen to a site in our constituency, but that is impossible. That is why I tabled the new clause. We just need openness and transparency.</p>

	<p pid="b.575.5/1">That is a valid point, but I do not want in any way to insinuate anything about the intentions of the Mayor of London, TfL and so on. Our fear is about the unintended consequences. The fear that I and some others expressed on Second Reading concerned the inability in some instances&#8212;this might have happened with Earls Court&#8212;of Transport for London officers and those directing them to negotiate effectively with people who are ruthless in the development of sites and the maximisation of their profits from those sites. That brings me back to new clause 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.5/2">I want Transport for London to be completely open and transparent and publish a list of the properties and assets it holds and that its subsidiaries hold which it considers eligible for future development, banding them</p>
	<p pid="b.575.5/3">by value so that we can assess the individual values of the properties and the potential borrowing against them. The new clause requires TFL to undertake this exercise every year, because the intentions of TfL and the Mayor will change. It is therefore important that the asset list is updated as well as the list of plans associated with those assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.575.5/4">Each year, the new clause will insist that Transport for London must inform Londoners of the non-operational assets it holds as well as those that are under consideration for development in which action leading to development is under way or planned in the next 12 months. Part of the problem arising from Earls Court and some of the other discussions is that some people did not even know who owned some of the site and the Mayor and Transport for London were never completely open about their intentions. The new clause will ensure that we know who owns the sites and what sites TfL has, and will also ensure that TfL comes clean about what it intends to do with those sites, whether it be development with a partner, selling the site off or using it to borrow money, as specified under the Bill, to indemnify itself against costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.576.0/1">The new clause is extremely sensible, for the reasons that have been set out. It may well also assist TfL as I suspect that, despite my hon. Friend&#8217;s confidence, TfL probably does not know where some of its assets are. In my experience, it certainly does not know their value, and that is the cause of mistakes in how it disposes of property. Notwithstanding the fact that I have put my name to the new clause, I would quarrel with the reference to commencement within the next 12 months. In some instances&#8212;I shall expand on this point if I have the opportunity to do so&#8212;development is planned and proposed but for operational or other reasons the plans are made several years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.576.1/1">Okay, let us have that argument. The reason I specified 12 months is that I think it is a realistic timetable for concretising the plans that TfL and the Mayor have for a site, so that they are more focused on being absolutely clear about what is imminent. I agree that it would be good to have a longer-term plan, but I think that 12 months is more realistic, given that the Mayor has a five-year period in office.</p>

	<p pid="b.576.2/1">I understand what my hon. Friend says, but the example I was thinking of is Lillie Bridge depot, which is the third element of the Earls Court site. At the moment we are being told that development might happen in five or six years&#8217; time, but I fear that in the interim&#8212;it is not only a major employment site for skilled labour, but a manufacturing site and a key site for TfL&#8212;it is being run down or that other changes are being made that will make unsuitable development a fait accompli.</p>

	<p pid="b.577.0/1">I know that I am a signatory to new clause 1, but I must press the point about 12 months, which I think is wholly inadequate. If we look at just one aspect of London Underground, the Victoria line, we see that the number of trains on the line is now double the amount that it was originally planned to take, which means there is great difficulty packing those trains on to the sidings at Northumberland Park, and the same applies to every other line. We need far more than a 12-month look ahead; we need to look ahead 10 or 20 years for the continued growth of transport in London and the need for land and facilities to accommodate it, rather than doing nothing now and spending a lot of money buying them back from the private sector at a later date.</p>

	<p pid="b.577.3/1">Credibility is sinking in this House. I will not rise to that comment, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.577.3/2">I hope that the Bill does not go through tonight, so that we can address the amendments we have tabled. That will give us the opportunity to look at the new clause and see&#8212;let me put it this way, in order to be helpful&#8212;whether we can ensure that information is provided by Transport for London and the Mayor on both a short-term assessment of the use of a planned asset or site and a medium-term option within at least the lifetime of a mayoralty. I think that might be a useful compromise&#8212;I do not want to be accused of going soft on these issues. I raise that point with the hon. Member for Harrow East because I think it is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.577.3/3">The purpose of clauses 4, 5 and 6, we are told by the Bill&#8217;s promoters, is to enable the Mayor and Transport for London to enter into deals with private sector partners. These are development companies, and the aim is to develop TfL&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; sites to secure a revenue stream to compensate for the 25% cut in Government grant to Transport for London and eventually for the complete loss of all central Government grant. How do we know that? It was raised on Second Reading and we sought confirmation from the Minister, who said:</p>
	<p pid="b.577.3/4">&#8220;The outcome of the 2013 spending review was a 25% cut in TfL&#8217;s operational funding from central Government, and we have been clear that the Government&#8217;s aim is to reduce TfL&#8217;s operational funding over time to zero.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2014-09-09.853"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 September 2014; Vol. 585, c. 853</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.577.3/5">So the purpose behind the Bill is to ensure that TfL raises another income stream to compensate for the Government&#8217;s cut in grant.</p>
	<p pid="b.577.3/6">We need to examine the scale of the grant cut, which will be reflected in the potential scale of the use of the asset base. That is another reason why it is crucial that we get a definition and a list of TfL&#8217;s asset base on a value banded basis, as set out in new clause 1. I worry about the scale of income that TfL is looking to deliver from its asset base in proportion to the loss of grant.</p>

	<p pid="b.578.0/1">I have no objection to TfL developing its non-operational land or retaining a stake in that land and deriving an income from it. What I object to&#8212;I think my hon. Friend agrees with me on this point&#8212;is the vehicles that TfL is using for doing that, and the underlying secrecy and inconsistency. Having set that out as a policy, in cases where it suits TfL&#8212;I am thinking of another site in my constituency, Shepherd&#8217;s Bush market&#8212;it simply threw up its hands and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to sell the asset anyway.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.578.1/1">I disagree. I agree about the importance of new clause 1 requiring a list of assets, but I inserted the identification of their value by band because I am worried about the scale of the overall risk if, for example, as in the Bill, all or any of these assets can be used against borrowing&#8212;can be charged or mortgaged to secure borrowing. The scale of that risk is enormous. If we look at the scale of the loss of grant, which is the funding gap that Transport for London and the Mayor are trying to deal with, that will give us an idea of the scale of the use of TfL&#8217;s assets for borrowing purposes and development deal purposes, and the risk that Londoners could then face. It is enormous.</p>
	<p pid="b.578.1/2">I have looked at Transport for London&#8217;s annual report and accounts. They are not easy reading. For 2013 the total amount of grant aid from central Government, excluding Crossrail, for general and capital grants was &#163;3.2 billion. On page 140 of the annual report and accounts for 2013-14, table 9 shows the entitlement of grant income which identifies the non-ring-fenced grant from the Department for Transport to Transport for London, which is &#163;632.8 million. Non-ring-fenced grant to fund capital from the Department for Transport is &#163;1,578.4 million. So when the Minister talks about reducing the Department for Transport grant to Transport for London to zero, the magnitude of the sum that the Mayor and Transport for London want to raise from these deals with private developers or to borrow against these assets becomes clear. It is staggering. It is enormous&#8212;</p>

The Bill is driven by the gap that the Government and the Department for Transport have indicated to this Mayor of London&#8212;any Mayor of London&#8212;and the Mayor and TfL are being driven to asset-strip public assets. Left-wing thinking has moved on. Even the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s left-wing thinking has moved on.

	<p pid="b.579.3/1">Let me focus on the issue that Madam Deputy Speaker raised. TfL is trying to bridge a gap as a result of loss of Government grant. We will come on to the borrowing issues on the second group of amendments. One of the methods, as in Earl&#8217;s Court, is to enter into deals with private developers to secure some form of revenue income from the asset that is then developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.3/2">I understand all that. I was chair of finance on the Greater London council. At 29 I was responsible for a &#163;3 billion budget. What we did was exactly that. We had a capital fund that was agreed on a cross-party basis, secured against the assets of London overall. That is not a risk. We had the assets, we could go to the City and borrow from the City. We would put it into a pool. I think the system was established by a Conservative administration and inherited by a Labour one. We had cross-party agreement that that was the way in which we would go forward. It was not on the basis of mortgaging the individual assets and going into a link-up with a private developer, and it was certainly not about the development of sites to give revenue income in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.579.3/3">The point of new clause 1 is that I do not object in principle to going into some forms of partnership for the development of a site that will secure a valid revenue income. The issue is exactly as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40690" name="George Galloway">the hon. Member for Bradford West (George Galloway)</phrase> said&#8212;it must be open, transparent and agreed with the local community, London boroughs and all the other stakeholders: the passenger representatives, the trade unions on behalf of their members, and so on.

At the Shepherd&#8217;s Bush market site, the market will be lost and luxury flats will be built.

It has emerged in the discussions so far&#8212;Earls Court is the best example, but there may be others&#8212;that unless there is an open and transparent process and lists of available assets are produced, the information becomes almost private and there is an arrangement with an individual developer rather than a proper open, competitive process whereby others can make proposals for the site. In addition, unless there is clarity about the sites that TfL has and its intentions for them, local authorities, for example, are prevented from coming forward with their views about how they could work together with TfL on using the sites for the better development of the whole community as well as transport.</p>

Friend intended&#8212;I think he has now explained that he did&#8212;to address these other evils: first, with all the sites we have mentioned, a deal is made with a single developer, without advertisement or competition, so we have no idea whether the market has been tested; and secondly, the developer then enters into a deal, usually a master-plan agreement, that then dictates to the local planning authorities how the land should be developed. That is exactly the wrong way in which local development plans should work.</p>

	<p pid="b.580.4/1">That sort of process is a scandal, to be frank. We would not tolerate it in other public bodies, and I do not understand why we are allowing it to happen with TfL.</p>
	<p pid="b.580.4/2">The whole purpose of having the lists proposed in new clause 1 is to make sure that the information is genuinely public. At the moment, even some of the people living on these sites are unaware of TfL&#8217;s ambitions. They were certainly not consulted about, or, at some stages, even aware of, the Earls Court development. I want to</p>
	<p pid="b.580.4/3">ensure that those who live on or have businesses on the sites or near them and the London boroughs and the communities in which they are located are fully aware of, fully conversant with, and fully informed about TfL&#8217;s asset base and its intentions for the assets within their area. If an asset is listed by TfL publishing information in this way, those stakeholders, including TfL&#8217;s employees and subsidiaries, will have at least an early warning of the development prospects of the site or asset in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.580.4/4">This is one of the critical issues raised at the Opposed Bill Committee hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-13">Tuesday 13 January 2015</phrase>. I refer in particular to the evidence provided by Greater London Assembly member, Mr Murad Qureshi, on the basis of whose statements I tried to draft the new clause. Paragraph 115 of his evidence contains a startling example of the lack of information being provided by TfL. He said that his concerns about the whole Bill, particularly clause 5, relate to TfL&#8217;s transparency as a public body. Further on in his evidence, it emerged that the GLA had had to go through a freedom of information process to obtain information about TfL&#8217;s land holdings. It cannot be right that a public, democratically elected body has had to go through that process. In paragraph 116, he cited the Earls Court development as a perfect example of a TfL asset being developed with a lack of transparency on its decision making. In paragraph 122, he said that, to gain information on TfL&#8217;s planned investment programme, the GLA&#8217;s budget and performance committee&#8212;not individual members but a committee&#8212;was forced to make a freedom of information request. In paragraph 241, he sums up the fears that GLA members have about the secrecy and lack of transparency of TfL&#8217;s activities. Throughout the evidence session, petitioners gave examples of the difficulties they faced in securing any information about the plans that TfL and the Mayor had for the development and use of TfL&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; assets. That was raised continually.</p>
	<p pid="b.580.4/5">The new clause would ensure that at least one report is published that brings together all the information to which Londoners, London boroughs, the City of London corporation&#8212;if we have not abolished it by then&#8212;passenger groups and TfL&#8217;s own employees can refer when they want to know what assets TfL and its subsidiaries hold, but more importantly, what plans TfL and its subsidiaries, and therefore the Mayor, have for the development or use of these assets. This is a simple exercise in openness and transparency, and I cannot see why anyone, least of all TfL and its subsidiaries and the Mayor, would object to it.</p>

	<p pid="b.581.0/1">I think that people would be shocked to find that the GLA has had to use quasi-legal processes to obtain information from TfL. There is nothing new about TfL being a secretive body. I remember dealing with it 30 years ago over the appalling development of Hammersmith centre. I hoped that the GLA and the Mayor would provide some democratic accountability in that regard, but my hon. Friend&#8217;s example shows that that is clearly not happening. It is therefore all the more necessary that we put into statute the responsibility that TfL should have.</p>

	<p pid="b.581.1/1">As I said, this is a simple exercise; it is not difficult to do. In fact, most local authorities regularly undertake an asset base review that is published,</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/2">and will often be translated into a link with their planning policies as well, so that people can know about these sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/3">The new clause was drafted in the context of the deep suspicion that has arisen about the Mayor&#8217;s and TfL&#8217;s intentions with regard to linking up with private developers on grandiose development schemes that could curtail or impede the use of TfL&#8217;s land holdings and other assets for the long-term improvements of London&#8217;s transport network. Londoners, especially London&#8217;s elected representatives on the GLA and the London boroughs, have expressed their concerns about whether the rush to use TfL&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; assets to bridge the current projected funding gap is overriding sound investment and operational judgments&#8212;indeed, at times, common sense&#8212;in relation to the use of those assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.581.1/4">On Second Reading, hon. Members on both sides of the House expressed concern about TfL&#8217;s capacity to negotiate these schemes. At the evidence session on <phrase class="date" code="2015-01-13">13 January</phrase>, people questioned whether TfL and its subsidiaries and the Mayor have the expertise to exercise sound judgments in the necessary negotiations with developers and development partners to determine what use an asset will be put to. They queried what ratio of benefit will be allocated to TfL and its subsidiaries, as against the benefit derived by the private sector partner, and what value for money TfL, and therefore London council tax payers and fare payers, will achieve in these deals.</p>

We keep coming back to the Earls Court site, but it is a &#163;12 billion development&#8212;the largest in London&#8212;and TfL jobs, affordable homes and one of London&#8217;s premier exhibition centres are being lost to provide, in effect, safe-deposit flats that probably no one will live in. TfL&#8217;s judgment has to be seriously brought into question even before we turn to the finances.</p>

	<p pid="b.582.1/1">New clause 1 will inform all stakeholders and interested parties that an asset held by TfL is being considered for use in a development deal and that action is under way or being planned over the next 12 months to use it in some way. That information will trigger the interest of stakeholders and enable them to gear up for discussions and consultations with TfL about the development and use of that asset. If the new clause is agreed to, no more would we see communities and local authorities shocked and surprised to find, late in the day and contrary to their wishes, that a site in their area has been included in a development deal with a private development company.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.1/2">The proposal for the publication of a list of TfL&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; assets and a statement of TfL&#8217;s intentions for them also goes to the heart of the concern of many hon. Members and others in relation to clauses 4 and 5. They are anxious about the Mayor&#8217;s ambition to use the vast range and magnitude of TfL&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; assets to secure borrowing, which we will come to in the second group of amendments. There is concern that TfL&#8217;s standing could be put in serious jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.1/3">This is simply about ensuring that people are properly informed about the intentions, so that they can calculate the risk involved. The proposed report would be an</p>
	<p pid="b.582.1/4">invaluable tool in enabling all stakeholders to hold TfL and the Mayor to account if they launch a new venture as part of large-scale property development deals. Hon. Members should not underestimate TfL&#8217;s massive asset base&#8212;it has 3,000 properties across London&#8212;and in particular the assets located in central London. Those historic inherited sites are located in the most lucrative parts of the city, which private developers have an interest in developing. In fact, it is widely known in property circles that property developers from across the world are desperate to engage in dialogue with TfL on the prospect of gaining access to those sites and, to be frank, of running rings around TfL and the Mayor and walking away with massive profits.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.1/5">There is a risk in so many TfL sites and assets coming into the market as part of such development deals. A report requiring TfL to identify the value of the assets, in bands, and its plans for the asset sites over the next 12 months would at least result in a proper assessment taking place. The report would shed critical light on both the quantum and the timing of the potential risk to TfL, Londoners, passengers, employees and council tax payers. That is why new clause 1 is so fundamental to the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.583.1/3">In conclusion on new clause 1, this new clause is fundamental to the Bill if Londoners are to be protected against the flights of speculation of TfL under the direction of, and perhaps pressure from, the Mayor, whoever he or she may be, and speculative developers from across the globe, including some&#8212;this has been mentioned with regard to the Earls Court site&#8212;who are linked to tax-avoiding companies and corporations, including oligarchs with doubtful histories and backgrounds.</p>

	<p pid="b.583.2/1">On the agreement entered into on the Earls Court exhibition centre, the publication of such a list might reveal that, on Earls Court 1, which is the largest piece of land, the developer held a relatively short lease on the property and the freehold and the reversion remained with TfL. However, TfL has a 37% stake in that joint venture company, which means that it has a minority of votes on the board. Effectively, it has surrendered all decision making on the site to the developer, but, should the developer of this &#163;2 company go bust, the taxpayer would be left with the liability.</p>

	<p pid="b.584.0/1">I would hope that a publication in which TfL indicated its plans for specific sites would include information about which companies and corporations it is dealing with as partners. On the Earls Court development, there are real concerns that TfL has got into bed with a company that is based in a tax haven, and I believe that some directors of individual companies have been prosecuted. That allegation has been made before on the Floor of the House and I think it is accurate.</p>

	<p pid="b.584.4/1">In developments of TfL assets, it is important to have full transparency on the relationship with individual companies. I say that in the light of the report published last week, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.584.4/2">&#8220;Hundreds of millions of pounds&#8217; worth of UK properties held in secretive offshore companies have been used to launder the proceeds of international corruption&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.584.4/3">That has been identified by Scotland Yard. The report went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.584.4/4">&#8220;The scale of the problem has been revealed by Transparency International on Wednesday, with the anti-corruption campaign group warning that the UK has become &#8216;a safe haven for corrupt capital stolen from around the world&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.584.4/5">It is absolutely critical to ensure openness and transparency on the proposals for individual sites to guard against TfL and others entering into relationships with companies and corporations that we do not consider appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.584.4/6">I now turn to new clause 2, which is another attempt to safeguard the assets with regard to landholdings that may be required for the development of the transport network in London. In its submission to Members of the House, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers has publicly made a point with which I fully concur. Its briefing quite clearly sets out the anxiety about the loss of potential sites, saying that new clause 2 will therefore ensure that when TfL or any subsidiary seeks to lease or develop such sites, there is full consultation with the local communities likely to be affected, the Greater London Authority, London boroughs, the City of London and relevant trade unions. That consultation has to take place before Transport for London or any subsidiary enters into a contract involving the development of land other than for the provision or maintenance of transport services.</p>

	<p pid="b.587.2/1">I will explain to the House what has happened before I take the point of order. The procedural motion that we just agreed to was that the motion be proposed, because the mover was on his feet. That means that the motion on new clause 1 has been proposed and the debate continues. It was not a closure motion, but what is called the Golding closure. The Minister needs to decide whether he would like to speak on new clause 1, because we are now debating new clause 1 and the other amendments on the selection list. Are there any takers?</p>

	<p pid="b.588.2/1">Not yet&#8212;I have not even started my speech. I expect to make some progress before taking an intervention from the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.588.2/2">The Bill started in the other place in November 2010. It has gone through Second Reading in this place and an Opposed Private Bill Committee, where there was the opportunity to make many interventions and many changes. After Second Reading in this place, the proposers approached all those who opposed the Bill, as I suggested they should, to encourage them to develop their concerns so that there was an opportunity to understand those concerns and to amend the legislation, if necessary. The reality is that they have moved substantially and I want to respond on the details.</p>
	<p pid="b.588.2/3">The coalition Government have moved towards devolved government in London and across the country. Amendments 21 to 29 would take power away from the Mayor of London and require the Secretary of State to intervene. That is a centralising move that the House should reject absolutely, as more power is being devolved to the regions and to London in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.588.2/4">Briefly on new clause 1, the disposal of non-operational assets is covered by section 163 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, which was introduced by the last Labour Government and has been added to since. The review that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington proposes in the new clause would be extremely expensive. That cost would fall on the taxpayer and the fare payer.</p>

	<p pid="b.588.4/1">I will give way after I make this point. On the visibility of Transport for London&#8217;s property portfolio, there is already a searchable website that any hon. Member, member of the public or interested party can search to establish what property holdings Transport for London has right across the capital. I am very surprised that the hon.

	<p pid="b.588.5/1">The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, he argues that it is too expensive to produce a list under new clause 1, but on the other he says that a list exists. The new clause will ensure that Transport for London publishes a list not only of its assets, but of its plans for those assets. That is the whole issue in this debate&#8212;the lack of openness and transparency from Transport for London about the development of its intentions for individual sites, as we have seen with the disastrous consequences for Earls Court, where 700 homes were lost to the local community. Do the hon. Gentleman, on behalf of Transport for London, and the Mayor of London oppose new clause 1 to maintain that level of secrecy in their relationship with private developers?</p>

	<p pid="b.589.0/1">The reality is that the Greater London authority and assembly exist to scrutinise the work of the Mayor and Transport for London. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that they are not doing their job, he should condemn the members of that assembly. We should be placing power in the hands of Transport for London to carry out the functions we want, and to open up capacity for housing that is desperately required by Londoners. We must then ensure that that work is subject to scrutiny by the GLA and assembly members.</p>

	<p pid="b.589.1/1">Has the hon. Gentleman read the witness account from the Opposed Private Bill Committee? At that Committee, as I said earlier, a Greater London assembly member reported that the assembly&#8217;s own budgetary committee had to use freedom of information requests to gain information from Transport for London about the use of its moneys and assets. The lack of scrutiny is a result of the impediment placed by TfL in the way of Greater London assembly members. Will he read the transcript of evidence to the Opposed Private Bill Committee that was presented to the House?</p>

	<p pid="b.589.5/1">Indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.589.5/2">On new clause 2, the issue of securing consent for the disposal of land owned by TfL is well established in section 163 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. It includes a statutory regime for the disposal of former operational land, including requirements for the Secretary of State&#8217;s consent.

	<p pid="b.589.6/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned housing in London and the disposal of assets to meet housing needs. Is he aware that under permitted development rights, the conversion of office or industrial property does not require local planning consent so there is no social housing content to it?

	<p pid="b.590.11/1">I thought my judgment was correct: that is not a point of order. You are after a point of clarification, but that is not up to me. It is up to the sponsor of the Bill whether he wishes to give way. He has been courteous and given way a couple of times. Perhaps if he is allowed to speak for a little longer, I can call the Opposition spokesman and then some Back Benchers.

You wish me to speak on the specifics of the first group of amendments, Mr Deputy Speaker, which, as others have said, would impose additional duties on TfL when it wished to sell or develop non-operational land. Those on the Opposition Front Bench welcome that change to the Bill, which has already been made in the other place and offers some clarification on the distinction between operational and non-operational land.</p>
	<p pid="b.591.3/2">I would like to say a few further words on this group. I understand the desire of my hon.

	<p pid="b.591.4/1">We do not just want concessions; we want sensible planning of the transport needs of London. My hon. Friend will have heard our concerns in the earlier debate on new clause 1. Increasing use of the tube means increased trains, increased sidings and increased maintenance depots. If all the infrastructure facilities are sold off in a fire sale of public assets to bolster the</p>

	<p pid="b.592.0/1">I hear what my hon. Friend says. We want sensible planning and infrastructure to be at the heart of any development, which is why the Opposition have so strongly supported the establishment of an infrastructure commission. It is also why I am so surprised that those on the Government Front Bench do not feel they need to comment on this matter at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.0/2">I return to the specifics of new clause 1. It is important that the concerns raised in the House today are addressed, especially in light of the ongoing controversy over the Earls Court development, which has inevitably sharpened views and concerns about the general direction of travel in the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington said, he is trying to reflect the views raised by people and petitioners. He has also raised the issue of homes and housing. Those, too, are important issues for us to consider on both sides of the House. There are also the issues of transparency and consultation, which, my hon. Friend has made clear, lie behind many of his concerns in new clause 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.0/3">We are not opposed in principle to granting TfL greater powers, but, as always, there must be a balanced approach to any restrictions imposed on the relevant public authority. It is important that powers are not granted to TfL in theory if they then prove to be unworkable in practice. As legislators, we always have to be concerned about the law of unintended consequences and that is why I will now raise some points about this group in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.0/4">We have not spoken a great deal about new clause 2 so far, but as I understand it, it would debar Transport for London from leasing land that has been in operational use or even been considered for operational use, however briefly. As I understand it, there would be no barrier to TfL selling such land&#8212;indeed, it currently has the power to do so. Is there a danger, by forbidding the leasing of land but not the sale, of unintentionally creating an incentive to sell, with some assets lost to the public interest for ever? I feel sure that that is not the wish or the intention of the movers of the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="b.592.1/1">Clearly, there could be that interpretation, but a wise Mayor and a wise management of TfL would not jeopardise the future planning of the transport network in that way. The key aspect of new clause 2, which, unfortunately, I was not allowed to speak to, is a full consultation with all stakeholders to enable the complete engagement of all interested parties in the development of these sites.</p>

	<p pid="b.592.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point at the conclusion of his comments, which goes to the heart of the point he raised earlier on consultation and transparency. Since the Minister has not been prepared to address that here, I sincerely hope he will address it in a subsequent group or on summing up the whole debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/2">I well understand the intentions behind the amendments. The Bill has already been improved through parliamentary scrutiny. It is important that draft legislation, whether private or public, is tested even at this late stage in the parliamentary process. I welcome the opportunity the amendments have presented to probe the Minister and</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/3">the Bill&#8217;s sponsor, the hon. Member for Harrow East, and the clarification, even at this late stage, that I hope they will bring to the concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington referred to the difficulties that members of the London assembly have had in getting information on the assets concerned. Let us be in no doubt whatever: it is the responsibility of the Minister and the sponsor to justify the accountability agreements to the House tonight. I am interested to know whether members of the Greater London authority have asked for the powers that would oblige them to be consulted.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.2/5">The issues that lie behind the first set of amendments go to the heart of transparency and accountability&#8212;whether of Governments or public corporations. It is important that they be given every probing and every ventilation in the Chamber tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.593.0/1">This has not been our finest hour, as I tried to say in a point of order just 10 minutes or so ago. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40093" name="Gordon Marsden">The hon. Member for Blackpool South (Mr Marsden)</phrase> drew attention to the dog that did not bark in the form of the Minister, but there have been other dogs that have not barked or even turned up. In a short speech, that is the first point I should like to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/2">I am not a London Member, but I am a user of London transport and I have been a resident of London for 35 years. My eye was caught by this item of business because of a strong point of view I have about Earls Court. I expected to come into a packed Chamber. I especially expected to come into a Chamber packed with London Members of Parliament, but they have been very thin on the ground, with the honourable exceptions of my hon. Friends the Members for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) on either side of me, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40295" name="Andy Slaughter">the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter)</phrase> who unavoidably had to leave. That, however, has been the size of it. That is truly extraordinary given the importance of this measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/3">This is, potentially, a grand theft auto Bill. It deals with 3,000 properties. I have no idea of their value because no figure has been published. Taking a rudimentary guess, I think TfL&#8212;about which more later&#8212;will have &#163;3 billion, &#163;4 billion or &#163;5 billion of potentially disposable public assets, with almost no transparency or accountability, and no discussion or negotiation with other stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="b.593.0/4">By anyone&#8217;s standards, this is truly a remarkably important measure. It is more important even than I had thought before entering the Chamber. As I listened with horror to the narrative developed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, it took me back&#8212;your esteemed father was there, Mr Deputy Speaker, as was Madam Deputy Speaker who was in the Chair a moment ago, as she was in the Treasury at the time&#8212;to when the Treasury forced the then Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, down the road of a private finance initiative that came within an ace of sinking the London underground and costing the taxpayer &#163;3 billion.</p>

	<p pid="b.593.1/1">This was the point I raised earlier. The key aspect of the public-private partnership was the inability of the House, London Members and others</p>
	<p pid="b.593.1/2">just to get their hands on the information about the architecture of that PPP before it was imposed. Otherwise, I think it would have been exposed very early on.</p>

	<p pid="b.594.0/1">It was indeed a PPP, not a PFI&#8212;that alphabet soup is frequently jumbled in my mind. However, my hon. Friend is absolutely correct. If we had had proper scrutiny at the time, rather than the dragooning of Labour Members into supporting the Treasury position, it would have been exposed far earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/2">With the new clauses and amendments, and with the arguments made this evening, we have tried to expose folly on a potentially even larger scale. My hon. Friend&#8217;s speech was truncated rather ham-fistedly&#8212;if the promoter of the Bill will forgive my saying so&#8212;such that it did not achieve what the promoter wanted; it just made my hon. Friend, our expert on these matters, sit down, but we are still discussing what he was proposing. And this was after only one hour and 10 minutes. His argument was forensic. As I have often opined in here, Government Members do not like it up them&#8212;some of them do, that is true, but the promoter of the Bill did not, and it was because arrow after arrow of logic and forensic examination from my hon. Friend was hitting home that the attempt to close down the debate was mounted.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/3">&#8220;Mind the gap&#8221; is the rubric to remember. This is all about the gap in funding from central Government to Transport for London and closing that gap through the disposal of public assets. I said earlier in an intervention that on these matters left-wing thinking has moved on&#8212;even such left-wing thinking as that personified by my hon. Friend. We are not against making non-performing public assets perform in one way or another, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North pointed out, we do not want them performing in such a way that they can never again be used to perform the purpose for which they were originally intended, which in this case, of course, is to provide transport for London&#8212;the clue being in the name. In other words, we do not want land disposed of in a way that Transport for London can no longer control, so that assets are lost forever. We are not against making public assets perform, if they are not necessary now&#8212;or perhaps even for many years and decades in the future&#8212;but we have certain conditions, and one of them has to be transparency.</p>

	<p pid="b.594.1/1">New clause 1 does not actually require anything other than publication of information about non-operational assets that may be considered for any future activity or sale.

	<p pid="b.594.2/1">I can think of only one reason why they would be so opposed&#8212;public outrage would result. I am absolutely sure, in respect of the Earls Court development, to which I am about to turn, that had the public been properly informed about its development, public opposition to what in many respects is an act of vandalism would not have permitted the development&#8212;or at least the political cost would have been much higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.2/2">On the subject of transparency, the promoter of the Bill is simply wrong. He said he was against a list because it would be too expensive, but then, in the same breath, he said that there was a list, and he prayed in aid</p>
	<p pid="b.594.2/3">the existence of a Greater London assembly. However, the assembly&#8217;s budget committee, no less, told the Committee&#8212;the House of Commons&#8212;that it had had to go to law, through freedom of information searches, to force Transport for London, which nominally it is supposed to supervise, to give it any information at all. So transparency is definitely not the middle name of Transport for London, and as long as that is the case, a suspicion will linger that grand theft auto is the game.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.2/4">We have a right to say that if a public authority&#8212;in this case, Transport for London&#8212;is to get into bed with the private sector, the bed partners should be reputable and transparent and located here in Britain and paying tax in Britain. We know that in the case of Earls Court that is not true. Why do companies locate in the Channel Islands? Because they prefer the climate, or because they prefer the opaque nature of taxation matters there? Surely we all know, given what has happened over the past few years, exactly why these cowboy developers locate themselves as far from public scrutiny, media scrutiny and the rest as they possibly can.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.2/5">I said that I would turn to Earls Court and I shall, but I notice that the brother of the Mayor has just left the Chamber. I had wanted him to be here when I said this. Forgive me, I have to say it: if public authorities and elected figures are going to play fast and loose, potentially, with large sums of public money, it is crucial that the public have trust in that institution or those public figures, but I do not believe that that trust exits when it comes to Transport for London or the current Mayor. I can speak ill of him now, but perhaps not in the new Parliament, should he be elected&#8212;no doubt you would be on your feet, Mr Deputy Speaker, and telling me to sit down. However, I do not believe that the conduct of public affairs by Boris Johnson over the past five years, or four years&#8212;of course he is going to continue breaking a promise in both offices&#8212;or the conduct of Transport for London&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.595.1/1">I stand corrected, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.1/2">That leads me to my last point. The Earls Court exhibition centre was a particular favourite of mine&#8212;I declare that interest: I have skated in it, I have shopped for my ideal home in it, I have listened to Bob Dylan in it several times. It was an act of vandalism to have it closed, but even worse was the loss of hundreds of TfL jobs&#8212;skilled jobs, real jobs, jobs that most Members have no idea how to do, jobs where men and women make things and fix things. Those jobs were cleansed out of central London. That was an absolute outrage.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.1/3">Even worse than that is the fact that hundreds and hundreds of affordable homes were cleansed from Earl&#8217;s Court to be replaced by apartments so lavish and so expensive that even Members of Parliament could not afford to live in them, let alone the local people whose housing stock was devastated at a stroke. That was all done with virtually no public scrutiny or accountability, and certainly no offer was made to other public authorities</p>
	<p pid="b.595.1/4">for the use of this land, as was the case prior to legislation in the 1980s, as my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North said.</p>
	<p pid="b.595.1/5">It really is an outrage&#8212;but it is, we fear, a sign of things to come. If this new clause is not passed and these amendments are not taken on board&#8212;no concession has been made from the other side&#8212;we fear that a sweetheart relationship between TfL and the Mayor, any Mayor, will exist to the detriment of the railway workers and of the bus workers whom I was proud to represent here in Parliament for many years as an MP sponsored by the Transport and General Workers Union. Local people, whose homes are razed as a result of these sweetheart deals, will be disadvantaged. What will be prejudiced most of all is the strategic need to keep London moving smoothly, economically and cheaply for the millions who depend on public transport.</p>

Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> then moved a procedural motion to prevent my hon. Friend from continuing his speech. That procedural motion was, unfortunately, carried. The sponsor then spoke for the briefest possible time&#8212;about 10 minutes, taking two or three interventions&#8212;and said no more. The Minister has absolutely nothing whatever to say, yet there seems to be a determination on the Government side to prevent us from having a proper debate about new clauses 1 and 2 and the other amendments in the group.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/2">I find it utterly extraordinary that the sponsor of a Bill that has huge implications for transport infrastructure developments and the people of London&#8212;4 million of whom use London underground at its busiest times every day, with many more using buses, overground interchanges and so forth&#8212;has so little to say about the crucial aspects of future planning and the possible disposal of assets. I think it is utterly extraordinary, and I would have thought that Transport for London would have briefed the hon. Member for Harrow East a bit better or got somebody to promote the Bill who was serious about promoting it and showed some proper knowledge and concern about the subject. The hon. Gentleman should be utterly ashamed of himself for his performance today. If he believes in this Bill, he presumably has something to say about it and presumably has some knowledge about its contents. It is not good enough to come here, mutter a few words and say, &#8220;I am the sponsor of this Bill.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/3">I hope this Bill does not pass. I hope we do not achieve the end of this Bill in this Parliament. Sadly, under parliamentary procedures, it can be transferred to the next Parliament. I hope to be here in the next Parliament, and I will continue my defence of access to public transport for the people of London and of their access to the assets that have been built up so carefully and so diligently by public servants of London Underground and later Transport for London. Whoever takes over the promotion of this Bill&#8212;the hon. Gentleman might no longer be with us after the next election&#8212;will,</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/4">I hope, be somebody a bit more diligent than him in understanding its contents. I find what we have gone through thus far to be utterly unbelievable.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/5">There is nothing very dramatic in new clause 1 that the Bill&#8217;s sponsor&#8212;perhaps he did not have a chance to read the new clause&#8212;could not have accepted or agreed to. It says simply:</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/6">&#8220;Within 3 months of&#8230;Royal Asset, TfL shall publish a list of non-operational assets, held by itself or a subsidiary&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/7">What possible problem could there be from that? It goes to say that TfL</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/8">&#8220;shall publish each year a list of non-operational assets that are under consideration for development where steps towards such development are planned to commence&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/9">We all have a right to know about publicly owned assets. Any self-respecting organisation should publish those assets. Local authorities have to publish them and do publish them, so what is so different about Transport for London in this respect?</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/10">New clause 2, also proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington, states:</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/11">&#8220;TfL, or any subsidiary&#8230;shall not lease land to third parties which&#8230;has been used in the preceding 10 years,&#8230;has been considered&#8230;in the preceding 10 years as suitable or&#8230;is adjacent to land in use in the preceding 10 years, for the provision or maintenance of transport services&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/12">in London. It goes on to require a degree of consultation with &#8220;the Greater London Authority&#8221;, which is of course the main body holding TfL to account, and with</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/13">&#8220;London boroughs&#8230;the City of London&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/14">and the &#8220;relevant trade unions&#8221; representing the workers who run the transport system in London. There is nothing in those new clauses that could not be properly considered as reasonable.</p>

	<p pid="b.597.1/1">I have followed from a distance&#8212;it is not in my constituency&#8212;the goings on in Hammersmith over Earl&#8217;s Court and the development that goes with it. The points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40690" name="George Galloway">the hon. Member for Bradford West (George Galloway)</phrase> are so important in explaining what has happened there. The campaigners wanted to preserve local facilities, jobs and the opportunity for an improved transport system in the future. The very least we can do in consideration of this Bill is to look seriously at what TfL is trying to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/2">We are all well aware of the problems of transport in London and of the need for serious long-term planning. I entered the House in 1983 when the Greater London Authority Bill became an Act, abolishing the Greater London council. There was a huge discussion about the role of Greater London council, formerly the London county council, in public transport matters. At the end of the debate on transport issues at that time, we ended</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/3">up with the establishment of Transport for London as a co-ordinating body for public transport undertakings in London. Fortunately, the right wing of the Conservative party was defeated on its wish to deregulate the bus service in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/4">Even at that time, we were expressing concern about the disposal of assets. There was a degree of thinking among London Underground and others that transport usage in London would continue to decline. It did not. It has not. We now have a very fast-growing public transport network in London. As I said, London underground has a maximum capacity of 4 million passengers a day, which has been achieved twice&#8212;once during the Olympics and then more recently. London&#8217;s population is going to rise, but car ownership will probably continue to fall in London because of the costs, congestion and so forth, so there is likely to be greater and greater demand for public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/5">My constituency probably has one of the lowest levels of car ownership in London, if not in the country, with less than a third of the population having access to a car. They rely totally on public transport. They are often very happy with the transport they receive. Clearly, however, there are growing demands. Any sensible transport authority would not be planning to dispose of assets; it would be protecting those assets, in order to allow expansion to take place in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/6">Let me give an example. Finsbury Park station, which is in my constituency, is a very busy underground station, a very busy interchange between Network Rail and London underground, and a very busy bus interchange with both those services, as well as serving local people who walk to the station. It takes about 30 million passengers on the underground and 6 or 7 million on the overground every year, and it is dangerously overcrowded. I have raised the issue many times on the Floor of the House. It is to his credit that, in response to a question that I asked following the congestion during the Christmas period, the Secretary of State agreed to visit the station, which he duly did. He met me on the overground platform, and we spent an hour walking around the station and looking at the facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/7">I believe that what is being proposed for Finsbury Park station is inadequate. Lifts are to be built, which is good, and there is to be a new entrance hall, which is also good, but unfortunately the Wells terrace entrance is to be closed, probably for eight months but perhaps for longer. That has to be worked out, and I hope that the closure period will be minimal. I also hope that the land assets surrounding the station will be protected, because I believe that the station as a whole is fundamentally inadequate to meet the needs of the travelling public. At peak times, about 30 Victoria line trains go through it in each direction, as well as a smaller number of Piccadilly line trains, and the platforms are too narrow. Someone, at some point, must grasp the nettle and make the decision to rebuild the station with much more platform capacity. Such rebuilding is not unusual: it has been done at Angel, and at other stations. However, it will not be possible if that option is closed off by sales of assets surrounding the station.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/8">I think that I understand Transport for London&#8217;s motives. Because the capital needs of the network are underfunded&#8212;that may sound extraordinary to people who come from outside London, but London underground is a very expensive system to operate because it is so</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/9">deep&#8212;and because of the difficulty of raising funds to deal with the problem, TfL has looked for assets to dispose of. That tends to be a short-sighted option, because it prevents later improvements to and development of sites. I hope that TfL understands that when those of us who represent constituencies with a very high usage of public transport&#8212;particularly London underground&#8212;raise concerns about the Bill, it is not because we want to delay its progress in a curmudgeonly way, but because we want to protect public assets so that we can have a better public transport system in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/10">I hope that the Bill&#8217;s sponsor will at least have the good grace to report our concerns to Transport for London, and to suggest that its representatives arrange to meet those of us who have raised those concerns and will continue to do so. We want an efficient public transport system in London, which I think is supposed to be the priority for Transport for London&#8217;s board. I am particularly concerned about Finsbury Park station, the relationship with Network Rail, and&#8212;in my view&#8212;the need for a single management of the whole station. At present, the station is managed by Transport for London and London Underground, and by Network Rail on the overground. I should have thought that making the station safer and more usable was the least that Transport for London could do. Some of us will not run away from this issue, because we are passionate about defending the interests of our constituents and others who use the underground system.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/11">I want to mention two more stations in my area before I deal specifically with my amendments. Archway station is a deep and fairly old station in my constituency, which was once the last station on the Northern line. It was called Highgate then. It was rebuilt in the 1960s, and the plan included the building of a very large office block known as Archway Tower above the station. To call it an unattractive building is to do it credit. It is ugly, to put it mildly. No amount of cladding, Russian vines or anything else would make it an attractive building, although some cladding might improve it.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/12">That building was constructed by London Underground, with public money. A succession of leases have been sold, at greater and greater cost, from developer to developer, and on many occasions the building has had to be leased back to the public sector. This is an object lesson in the mis-operation of public assets vis-&#224;-vis private assets. The public have spent a great deal of money on the building of Archway Tower, on leasing it to developers who have then subleased it, and on its refurbishment for the Department for Social Security and, when it moved, the Office of the Public Guardian and the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department, as it then was.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/13">The building has now been sold to a group called Essential Living, which is turning it into luxury flats. When I went to see its representatives, they told me that they were developing 120 luxury flats. When I asked them what was the social housing content, they looked at me blankly. When I then asked what contribution they were making to the community, they offered to subsidise an arts festival in the area. I want council housing there, because that would at least alleviate the problems in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/14">That asset was disposed of with no forethought, and there are many other such examples throughout London. I hope that Transport for London will understand that it has a real responsibility in respect of the way in which</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/15">it uses its assets. We want to know what assets it has, and why it wants to put them on to the market or use them to engage in a joint private development. I am not against development when it is appropriate. My borough&#8212;along with, I am sure, that of the hon. Member for Harrow East&#8212;has massive housing issues. Indeed, London is full of such issues. I have no problem if TfL uses genuinely surplus land for housing. However, it must be housing that will benefit the ordinary people of London who are living in the desperately overcrowded, poor-quality private rented accommodation about which I know the hon. Gentleman is also concerned. Those people need to live in social units run by the council, or by a housing association, and to pay social rather than market rents.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/16">As a public body, Transport for London has a responsibility in that regard. The aim of the Bill is to make TfL into a market operation that will maximise whatever market interest it has while ignoring its wider social responsibility to deal with housing issues throughout London. I hope that that is fully understood.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/17">The other station that I want to mention is Tufnell Park, whose problems relate to the sale of land and local assets. Tufnell Park station is very busy, although it is fairly small. I have just received a letter from Transport for London telling me that it will close the station for many months while it replaces the lifts. I have written to Transport for London&#8212;as have the councillors representing both the Islington wards that are adjacent to it, as well as the council itself&#8212;expressing concern about the fact that the station will be inoperative, and the fact that the nearest two stations are a considerable distance away. Why can TfL not replace one lift at a time, so that the station can remain in use? TfL says that this is how it does things, and that it is cheaper this way. Well, it may be cheaper for TfL, but it is not cheaper for all the people who will have a very long walk, and the people who must spend more rather than less time travelling to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/18">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will convey the message that sensible planning, rather than the disposal of neighbouring assets which, in the case of other stations, could be used to make local improvements, could alleviate some of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/19">Of course I recognise that assets have to be improved and the important works that have to be done on all transport networks at various times. The amendments I have tabled&#8212;amendments 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29&#8212;relate to the schedule at the end of the Bill. It is headed:</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/20">&#8220;Property which may be charged by a TfL subsidiary without the consent of the Secretary of State.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/21">That worries me a great deal, because if the property referred to in this schedule can be disposed of by TfL without the consent of the Secretary of State, I ask myself where will there be any public accountability over a decision made by TfL?</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/22">The property listed in the schedule, in paragraphs 1(a) to (o), start with</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/23">&#8220;property related to a road user charging scheme&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/24">The ones I am most concerned about, however, include sub-paragraph (k):</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/25">&#8220;property related to the use of land for keeping installed automated teller machines within stations and other property at stations which is exploited for commercial purposes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/26">I have an amendment that seeks to remove sub-paragraph (k) from the list, and I do so because, although it might sound fairly arcane, it is actually quite important to have somewhere to store equipment or to locate ticket&#8212;or any other&#8212;machines that might well be put there. If that is then disposed of to somebody else, &#163;100,000 may be made&#8212;perhaps &#163;500,000 if it is a big area. Quite a lot of instant money might be made out of that, but it is like the magic of the private finance initiative; it is candyfloss money that comes from nowhere. The problem is the rest of us pay for it for decade after decade as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.597.1/27">If TfL in its infinite wisdom&#8212;and its wisdom is absolutely infinite in all matters&#8212;decides to get rid of an area that is a location of automated ticket machines, or any other type of machine, and lease it back from the people it has sold it to, that is the road to nowhere. That is a small dollop of cash in from the private sector, and a very large payment out over years from the public sector to the private sector to maintain what was once ours in the public sector. That cannot be a sensible way of running&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.601.1/5">&#8220;property related to the use of land for commercial letting&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.601.1/6">That makes me very worried, because if it is a building that has been let our leased out by TfL, possibly at a very high rent, and it decides to sell it off and cash in on it, then the public income and the capital value are lost, and at the end of the lease the capital opportunity of doing something else with that building is also lost.</p>

	<p pid="b.601.3/4">Again, that land needs to be kept in the public sector, so that we can then use it for development in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.601.3/5">This Bill has a huge effect on a very large number of people. I have just pointed out three stations in my area which need a great deal of attention. Some attention is being given to Finsbury Park and I am grateful for what has been done so far on that, and I am grateful to the Minister for visiting, but consideration must be given to the future needs of the area and future transport developments. I also mentioned Archway and the possibility of a big road improvement scheme which will introduce a piazza for the people of the area, and made points about Tufnell Park station.</p>
	<p pid="b.601.3/6">Highbury and Islington station has been well developed and, because there was co-operation between public bodies, a post office has been closed and relocated and passed to TfL, so that it could demolish it and create a much larger circulating area for the very large numbers of people who use that station, including on Arsenal match days. That is a good example of public services working together. Had that building been sold years ago, as would be envisaged if it had been a TfL building, that possibility would have gone and the public would have had to buy their own property back at enormous cost. So I ask the Bill&#8217;s promoters to think a bit more deeply about their guardianship and stewardship of and responsibility for a massive public asset.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.603.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="603"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0003.htm#150316-0003.htm_spnew13">
	<p pid="b.603.1/1">The stewardship of public assets is very important. As someone who believes in public enterprise and public endeavour, I have to concede that the London Passenger Transport Board was established under a Tory Government in 1933. Lord Ashfield was its first chairman and he did a fine job in promoting its development. So even then, in the depths of the recession in the 1930s, there was a consensus that the public ownership of assets mattered, and he stood up against a lot of private interests to achieve that. Let us preserve what we have got, and recognise that the future inevitably is very unpredictable.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/2">I came into parliamentary politics at a time when London&#8217;s population was falling and bus and tube use was falling. I remember the then director of London Underground telling me how there were going to be fewer trains and fewer passengers and how LU was thinking about which assets it could get rid of because it did not need them. I cautioned against that, saying that it was a counsel of despair. I said that we needed more people on trains and buses and that fewer people in cars would lead to less congestion. That big public debate happened in London, and we moved into an era not of road building but of rail development and other improvements. London became the first capital city in which public transport usage started to go up; others have now followed.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/3">I ask the Bill&#8217;s promoters to think more carefully about what they are doing and to think more carefully about the precious asset that they have and about how they can develop and protect it. I thank the Minister again for his preparedness to engage on the issues that I have raised tonight. I am really grateful to him for that, and I hope that we can make some progress. That is the kind of engagement that we would like to see on the Bill, instead of this peremptory refusal even to discuss the serious concerns that have been raised by a number of Members this evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.603.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> and to hear his explanation of the new clauses and amendments that he has tabled. Amendments 21 to 29 would remove the requirement to consult or get permission from the Secretary of State on certain minor matters. There is a dilemma about whether it should be the Secretary of State who rules on these matters or the Mayor of London, with the assembly scrutinising what the Mayor and Transport for London do. A dilemma arises when we devolve responsibility and power: should we then recentralise it to the Secretary of State? We as London MPs face that challenge daily. The amendments would recentralise power to the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="b.603.3/1">Clause 4(6) introduces the need for the Secretary of State&#8217;s approval, which we all support&#8212;as does the hon. Gentleman, because it is in the Bill. The schedule, however, sets out a long list of functions and assets that virtually undermines that subsection. That is our anxiety about the schedule.</p>

	<p pid="b.604.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="b.604.0/2">Hon. Members have mentioned TfL&#8217;s failure to engage with the objectors, but having gone through the Opposed Private Bill Committee and listened to the various proposals, my understanding is that they have been reflected. TfL has sought to meet the objectors and hon. Members to ascertain exactly the details of their objections, and it will have heard what has been said tonight. Clearly, we will not reach agreement on all the amendments, but TfL will no doubt reflect on them.</p>
	<p pid="b.604.0/3">My concern on reading new clause 1 is that all such properties would have to be banded by value. In my judgment, that would lead to more speculation, rather than less. If TfL is disposing of assets, it should seek to maximise the value that it gets, but banding by value would play into the hands of property speculators. At the moment, the assets are all listed on a searchable website that can be seen by any member of the public, so we know what TfL owns. I therefore reject new clause 1.</p>
	<p pid="b.604.0/4">New clause 2 would set in train a whole series of consultations and place heavy restrictions on the disposal of land. In my view and in that of the promoters, that would place an unnecessary encumbrance on TfL. There is already a statutory regime, set out in section 163 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999. TfL cannot avoid that; nor does it wish to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.604.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will have heard my earlier comments on the parallels with the protection of rail land for future use. For example, the March to Wisbech line has been preserved even though it has not been used for many years. It is now going to be reopened because someone had the foresight to preserve it. I have the same concerns about TfL assets being put up for disposal. Does he not accept that having the Secretary of State in place to provide a kind of long-stop protection, as we are proposing, would be a good thing?</p>

	<p pid="b.604.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for the reasoned way in which he has made his points. The reality is, however, that there is already a clear procedure for the disposal of former operational land. There is no need to go into the kind of detail set out in new clause 2.

	<p pid="b.607.0/1">May I say at this stage that I would like to press amendments 1 and 33 to a Division? Amendment 1 straightforwardly takes out paragraph (2) from the preamble of the Bill. Paragraph (2) refers to the powers set out in clause 4. I will then turn to amendments 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.607.0/2">Amendment 1 is consequential to amendment 15. What they do is delete the powers of Transport for London, set out in the Bill, to borrow by giving securities in the way prescribed in clause 4. The amendments strike at one of the main objectives of the Bill. Even if we took out clause 4, and even clause 5, we would still retain clause 7, which I support. Clause 7 concerns the mitigation of risk through hedging powers to be provided to Transport for London.</p>
	<p pid="b.607.0/3">I want to delete clause 4, to which amendments 1 and 15 relate, because I do not consider that it should be part of a private Bill. The purpose of the clause and the scale of the potential financial responsibility levied on London council tax payers and taxpayers militate against this being a private Bill; it should be a public Bill. Clause 4 should not stand in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.607.1/1">That is the point that struck me between the eyes. I am talking about having words such as &#8220;risk&#8221; and &#8220;hedging&#8221; in a private measure. Surely we have learned enough about the risk at the hands of</p>
	<p pid="b.607.1/2">private individuals and about the grave economic consequences to argue that this matter should be postponed until the next Government, when the state and the civil service can give it proper attention.</p>

	<p pid="b.608.0/1">I fully agree, and I shall develop that argument. What my hon. Friend is suggesting in his proposal is that it would be better if this clause were brought forward by the Government rather than in a private Bill. That is because of the scale of the risk involved in the exercise of these powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/2">I would welcome it if these powers were brought forward in a public Bill. Why do I believe that? Madam Deputy Speaker, let me take you to pages 929, 930 and 931 of &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;, with which I am sure you are fully conversant. On those pages, we see identified the subjects that should be considered as unsuitable for private legislation, but which should be dealt with by a public Bill. It says that a private Bill has sometimes been rejected, although properly introduced&#8212;as this one has been&#8212;because the House has decided, given the merits of the Bill in question, that the subject matter was unsuitable for private legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/3">There are examples in &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;, on pages 929, 930 and 931, of attempts to use private Bills to raise money for public purposes; it argues that they should fall under a public Bill. I will not go through them at length, but I will draw the House&#8217;s attention to the decisions made by previous Speakers. Those decisions have been based on &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;, which says:</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/4">&#8220;A bill the sole object of which was the creation of a charge on public funds has not been allowed to proceed as a private bill.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/5">There has also been the example of previous legislation. The Aberfan Disaster Fund Bill was rejected as a private Bill, but sections of it were brought forward as a public Bill. &#8220;Erskine May&#8221; says:</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/6">&#8220;A bill concerning a government guarantee, even though it amended a private Act, has been a public bill.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/7">That is exactly what the clause does.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/8">I am not saying that the whole Bill is unsuitable for private legislation, but clause 4 certainly is, and it should be deleted. The whole purpose of the clause, as far as I can see, is to allow Transport for London to raise funds by mortgaging assets. However, at the end of the day, the final guarantor of those charges will be the taxpayer, or the Treasury. Therefore, the provision should be brought forward as part of a public Bill rather than a private Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/9">I do not want to go over the arguments that we have already had with regard to the magnitude of the financial risk, the values of the sites involved, the billions of pounds at risk or the long-term consequences for the travelling public if a number of these speculative developments by the Mayor of London or Transport for London go pear-shaped. As far as I see it, that risk is intolerable.</p>

	<p pid="b.608.1/1">On the detail of it, can my hon. Friend think of any other examples where a private Bill has been used as a vehicle for disposing public assets? Normally, private Bills are about a privately owned development such as a dock or a harbour, but this is very different. Existing public assets are being put at risk, or mortgaged, which is hardly in the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.609.2/1">Thank you for the compliment, Madam Deputy Speaker; it is not often that Deputy Speakers say that to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/2">Let me respond briefly to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North by referring him to page 930 of &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;, which cites the assessment of the Speaker in 1895 of the London Valuation and Assessment Bill. The Speaker then ruled that</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/3">&#8220;since the Bill raised questions of public policy of great importance and affected interests of vast magnitude, it ought to have been introduced as a public bill, and could not proceed as a private bill&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/4">I do not know what greater magnitude of risk there is to London, London taxpayers, the Greater London assembly and others than the risk that we are contemplating in this Bill. I do not want to go over the facts and figures we set out before, but I must say to the sponsor of the Bill, the hon. Member for Harrow East, that the Mayor could potentially enter into an enormous escapade if this legislation is passed. For that reason, I do not believe that it warrants support as part of a private Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/5">Let me return to the link between amendment 1 and amendment 15. Amendment 15 simply seeks to delete clause 4, as I believe that it is dangerous. I was trying to get clarification about the objectives of the clause from the statements&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.610.2/1">A growing problem has resulted from operators of private car parks deciding that a lucrative income stream is to be had by clobbering motorists who use their car parks but, for whatever reason, overstay the period they paid for. As an MP, I have received several letters from constituents who see the practice as totally unfair and wildly disproportionate to the fee paid for parking.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/2">Just a glance at the fee versus the fine will demonstrate that admirably. In 1817, a Bedfordshire man received the death penalty for stealing a sheep; the sentence was commuted to life transportation. One might think that that was somewhat harsh for the crime that was committed. That disproportionate penalty no longer exists, but if one is looking for a new fine that is as disproportionate to the misdemeanour, if I can call it that, one can see that the car park cowboys fill the role admirably and with a zealotry and passion that would normally make their mothers proud&#8212;although not in this case, I imagine.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/3">The car parks are cash magnets for the operators, who milk the motorist and use harassment and threats to extort money. Their intimidating letter are intended to frighten and their message is quite simply &#8220;stand and deliver&#8221;, the motto of the highway man in a long bygone era. The only thing missing is the pistol, but they use the threat of courts, which could be expensive if people use legal representation, and an ever-escalating tariff of fines that simply bleed the motorist further, and all because they overstayed their welcome by a few minutes after having paid perhaps just a pound&#8212;giving the ultimate new definition of &#8220;poundstretcher&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/4">That is tantamount to demanding money with menace and should now be outlawed. A good case in point is The Whalley Arms car park in my constituency, used by the local community in a village that is strapped for car parking places. Local councillors Terry Hill and Joyce Holgate and I have received numerous letters of complaint from individuals who are incandescent that the operators are allowed such powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/5">One constituent, Mr Clive Marsden, was visiting his GP in Whalley. He is a bit slow on his feet as his hip needs replacing. That is being done tomorrow and we all wish him well with his operation and his new hip. He unknowingly typed his registration number wrongly but he still paid his &#163;1 fee. Some of the keyboards are very small and relatively low, and if the sun is shining on them and a person&#8217;s eyesight is not 20/20 things might be a bit hit and miss, as they were in this case. He received a fine through the post of &#163;100, to be reduced to &#163;60 if he paid up. He rightly thought that that was unfair as he had paid his pound but unwittingly made a minor mistake. Clearly, he appealed.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/6">Mr Marsden had his son-in-law with him who at the same time parked another car whose registration number was entered correctly. My constituent politely and helpfully suggested that if the company looked at its records, it would see that a fee was paid at a particular time using a registration number very similar to his. The cameras collecting the registration plate numbers would have collected their plate numbers and shown that a fee had</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/7">been paid for a car that did not enter the car park. Simples, as the advert says. The case could have been closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/8">The company ignored Mr Marsden&#8217;s suggestion and reiterated the conditions of parking with the stipulation about the correct registration. He appealed to POPLA, the panel that considers such appeals, but it rejected his appeal, stating that his ticket was not displayed correctly as stipulated by the operator. I assume that the P in POPLA stands for pathetic, as the car registrations are collected by the camera, there is no parking attendant, the extortionate fine is issued automatically, and the operator&#8217;s notice states that there is no need to display a ticket. I assume that POPLA will read the debate and I want it to tell me which bit of what Clive Marsden was asking the operator to do was unreasonable. Does POPLA think it is right to clobber motorists when there is a system of checking car registrations paid for against those entering the car park when motorists can furnish rough times of entry? Now, Mr Marsden, fresh from his operation, will have to go to court to fight his case. I hope he wins.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/9">There is also the case of a young lady, Niamh McNamara, at the same car park. She failed to pay because the machine was faulty and would not take money, and the other machine had a black bin bag over it. There was no attendant to take the money. She could not pay, so she went to the GP&#8217;s surgery and came back, thinking nothing of it. I wonder how many people were nabbed that day. She went home and left for South America on a backpacking holiday. Fortunately, her parents, my constituents, went to Manchester, where she lives, and picked up her mail. There was a demand for &#163;150. Clearly, the time for appeal had elapsed and the charge had gone up to the full fine with an added penalty of &#163;50. Her parents tried to reason with Debt Recovery Plus Ltd, but the company was not interested. After much reasoning, it said that it would reduce the amount to &#163;120. The debt recovery people also threatened the family, saying that their daughter would face court proceedings and that her credit rating would be affected. Under duress, her parents paid up to protect their daughter. The short of it is that she could not pay, and yet was still fined. That is simply not justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/10">The RAC published a report last month entitled &#8220;Private Parking&#8212;Public Concern&#8221;. I am sure that the Minister has read it. In it, John de Waal QC argues that these fines are illegal as they have no relationship to the loss incurred by the company. The person pays &#163;1 for parking, overstays 10 minutes and is fined &#163;60 or &#163;100. How can that be fair? The charge at The Whalley Arms car park for 12 hours&#8212;there is no charge for night time&#8212;is just &#163;5 for the entire day, so how can a fine of &#163;60 or &#163;100 be fair? Mr de Waal also argues that early payment discounts are unfair as they put pressure on the consumer to pay up rather than risk having to pay another &#163;40, or even more if they go to appeal.</p>

	<p pid="b.611.0/1">Is my hon. Friend as shocked as I am by the behaviour of ParkingEye at the Roaring Meg retail park in Stevenage? Parking there is free for three hours, but on match days it is free for only one and a half hours. Every week constituents who do not know it is a match day incur large fines. When we take those cases up with ParkingEye, which we do on a weekly basis, it says that it puts out mystical</p>
	<p pid="b.611.0/2">boards demonstrating when it is a match day, but it provides no photographic evidence of the boards and nobody has ever seen one.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.612.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40498" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="612"  time="020:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0003.htm#150316-0003.htm_spnew31">
	<p pid="b.612.0/1">Nothing shocks me about that industry. It sounds to me like a scam, so I am pleased that my hon. Friend has come here this evening to talk about the plight of his constituents. If a car park has a tariff, or if it has no tariff for certain hours, that is what people are accustomed to. He is right to say that many constituents will be uninterested in whether it is a match day, whatever the match happens to be, and so will carry on in their usual fashion. It seems that many of them will thus be clobbered by ParkingEye. That is totally unfair and it should look again at its practices. I trust that the Minister has heard what my hon. Friend has said.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/2">Back to POPLA&#8212;or un-POPLA, as I prefer to call it. On the &#8220;Frequently asked questions&#8221; page of its website, to the question &#8220;Will the parking charge increase if I lose my appeal?&#8221; amazingly it answers &#8220;No&#8221;, but follows that with:</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/3">&#8220;If your appeal is refused then the full parking charge will be due because the time for any early payment discount offered by the operator will have passed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/4">In my book that is a &#163;40 increase in what an individual would normally have paid. Only POPLA could make those grasping operators appear angelic by offering a reduction should the individual cough up straight away and fail to appeal.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/5">The message from the operators is this: &#8220;If right is on your side as you couldn&#8217;t get the coins in or you mis-typed your registration number, just take the hit on the chin; otherwise, you might get another hit on the chin.&#8221; If that does not work there is always the threat of a third hit on the chin, as credit ratings could be affected and another financial penalty added to the already extravagantly and insanely high fine.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/6">How big is that insane fining regime? It is a massive extortion racket worth hundreds of millions of pounds. In 2013 the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency was asked for the registration plate numbers of 2.2 million car owners, and it provided them for a fee&#8212;a nice little earner for a Government agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/7">The RAC instanced its own example of a young mum returning late to her car because one of her young children got upset. She also had a seven-month-old child in tow. She had to attend to her upset child and was late returning to her car, so she was fined. She did not have the resources to raise the &#163;60 to pay the fine in time so ended up paying &#163;100, and all for being a good mother.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/8">Minister, enough is enough. We all know that this wretched rinsing of the public has to end. The disproportionate fines should go, and those operators and the hoodlum side of their operations&#8212;the debt collectors who use oppressive means&#8212;have to be tamed and reined right back. Strong-arm tactics can be met only with a strong law response.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/9">The Government did well in 2012 to stop the ferociously active, salivating clampers from persecuting drivers with their hated Denver boots, but a new and sinister breed of persecution has taken over. The Government acted once, and it is now time to act again. As one might expect, I have a few suggestions for the Minister. The Government have already made an announcement concerning council-owned car parks giving a 10-minute grace period before</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/10">fines becomes actionable. I understand that that is now to be extended to privately owned car parks, which is good. That is one suggestion I was going to make that has already been enacted before I even asked for it. I hope that is a good omen for my other suggestions.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/11">The technology is available to allow car registration plates to be monitored on entrance and exit, so why not allow motorists the option of paying via credit card and being charged for exactly what they use? There would be no fines. I understand that that might require a change in legislation. If so, let us do it quickly in the next Parliament. In cases where the motorist does not have a credit card, why not just pay on exit with money, but at the actual rate? Again, there would be no fine. That might not even need a legislative change.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/12">Then there is payment by credit card or by phone. Drivers could be charged when exiting a car park, or they could pay by phone, as happens in London, with car park operators texting them to inform them that they are about to overrun their paid parking, offering them the option to extend. There would be no fine in that either.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/13">When someone mis-types their registration number, the operator should be duty bound to check the information to see whether it was likely that the wrong number was entered. I am sorry if that technically simple operation would spoil the bumper payouts to the car park regimes, but that is tough&#8212;natural justice is something I believe in. For small car parks in which it is simply not feasible to introduce that technology, we could have old-fashioned car parking attendants issuing tickets for the non-display of tickets.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/14">If the motorist appeals, there should be no inferred gamble here. The motorist has the option of going to Coral, Ladbrokes, William Hill, Betfred, Paddy Power or a number of other legitimate bookies if they want a flutter&#8212;I am currently at 33:1 for my seat at the general election. When a motorist makes an appeal, there should be no element of gamble in it. Let us end the early payment discounts or extend them to cover the full period of the appeal. I have never gambled &#163;40 in my life on any single punt, so why should the hapless and otherwise law-abiding motorist either be lured into a gamble that will cost them more if they lose or just have to cough up and pay the fine? That is no choice at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/15">Let us make fines relate to the loss incurred by the operator. If it costs &#163;1 to park for an hour and someone overstays by 10 minutes, some dynamo accelerator should not be allowed to kick in. Fines should be commensurate with the actual loss in relation to the car parking charges. I appreciate that there is an administration cost to be included, but it should also be proportionate, and the authoritarian, threatening, white-knuckle, gut-turning, official-like demands for eye-watering sums of money because someone has the audacity to overstay by a few minutes have to stop. If a car parking machine is not working, for whatever reason, it should be made illegal to fine people. That will stop another little scam whereby some people are simply harassed into forking out a fine despite the fact that they simply cannot pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/16">I understand that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government is about to be handed authority over private car parks by the Prime Minister. He will have the opportunity to bring some sort of order and common sense to a system that has simply spiralled out</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/17">of control and is hated by the long-suffering motorist, a system that is geared towards inflicting the greatest financial misery and disproportionate stress for what is, frankly, a minor contravention.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/18">I have spoken to the man who is about to take the reins of that wild animal and told him to be strong&#8212;not that he needs my advice, as I believe he knows what needs to be done. I and the public are fed up to the back teeth with charlatans operating under their own distorted and disproportionate penalty regime, unrelenting in the face of genuine mistakes or lapses in order to fill their coffers. It is now time for them to be brought under control and strictly regulated, with no room to siphon off hundreds of millions of pounds with kick-backs to debt recovery agencies and the DVLA. In short, it is time to act. Get to it, Eric.</p>

	<p pid="b.614.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40498" name="Nigel Evans">the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr Evans)</phrase> on securing the Adjournment debate tonight, and I thank him and my hon. Friend the Minister for being gracious enough to allow me to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/2">ParkingEye has been mentioned. When I became MP for South Derbyshire in 2010, I did not think that ParkingEye and particularly hospital car parking would become such a big issue, mainly because in the fabulous constituency of South Derbyshire we have free car parking. Our council does not charge for car parking. Every time we have had an extension of a shopping area, new companies coming in and new developments, we as a district council have always negotiated with the owners so that they would also have free car parking.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/3">That turns into a nightmare when firms such as ParkingEye come in and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley so clearly described, people mistype the number plate of their car. That tends to happen when they go over the border into east Staffordshire to Burton. At both of my two local hospitals, Derby to the north and Burton to the south, people have to pay to park, which is unknown to people in South Derbyshire, but as we do not have a hospital, we go north or south. In such circumstances, when people are rushing and are at the end of their tether because, for example, they are going to accident and emergency or their wife is going into labour, the last thing they need to have to cope with is ParkingEye. Exactly as my hon. Friend described, the press-button key pad is very small, and if the sun is shining on it or the person is flustered and makes a mistake, the fines issued by ParkingEye are horrendous.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/4">I am pleased to say that in the 18 cases in which constituents have asked me to intervene on their behalf, the hospital has waived the fee. I have not taken on ParkingEye because, fortunately, the chief executive at Burton hospital, Helen Ashley, has been very gracious, listened to the circumstances and waived the fee. There has been further investment to change the press-button keypads for ParkingEye so that they are much bigger and at eye level, and people no longer have to crawl out of their car window to hit the buttons appropriately. That has helped enormously, but the system is still pernicious and the fines are outrageous.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/5">We would like the Minister&#8217;s help on private car parks. With our fantastically expanding shopping areas, to mirror the free parking in the council car parks, the</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/6">big property developers that own the car parks have put in three free hours, after which a fine is imposed. I have some delightful pensioners who travelled in from one of the villages. They were doing a big shop so they did not come in on the bus. They take their car out about twice a week. The car park was incredibly full. The expansion of the economy of South Derbyshire is so tremendous that they ended up parking on a hatched area in the car park and got a horrendous fine. They are two pensioners on the basic state pension. The fine is incredible. They were visiting our new Aldi in Swadlincote, which is going great guns. The manager of Aldi is on their side. He wants ParkingEye to rescind its fine and we are fighting the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.614.0/7">I plead with the Minister for a much better code of conduct for the likes of ParkingEye, a much better code of conduct for policing fines on private car parks, and a better ethos on the part of such firms. They are the pirates of the new age and their behaviour is disgraceful. I do not want the good name of South Derbyshire, with our free car parking, taken in vain by those pirates. Anything the Minister can do to help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

	<p pid="b.615.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40498" name="Nigel Evans">the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr Evans)</phrase> on securing this debate. I understand how important this matter is to him and his constituents, and I recognise that the practices of some private parking companies can result in complaints from constituents. I have tried to find a stronger word than &#8220;complaints&#8221;, but I suspect I would veer into unparliamentary language were I to use the words that sometimes come to mind when I hear about cases where companies have behaved unreasonably.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/2">My hon. Friend has seen the written ministerial statement from the Prime Minister last week explaining that policy responsibility for off-street parking is now under the auspices of the Department for Communities and Local Government. Ministers in both Departments have worked closely together on a wide range of parking reforms, and it is my pleasure this evening to represent my Communities and Local Government chums in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/3">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40542" name="Heather Wheeler">the Member for South Derbyshire (Heather Wheeler)</phrase> for raising the important issue of hospitals, where having a pay-as-you-leave car park that has a system of number plates or tickets that can be used at a barrier on leaving reduces the stress that people feel in not knowing how long their appointment will take or how long they may have to wait. Many people worry that by overstaying, through no fault of their own, they may incur a fine. She also mentioned places where parking is initially free and people then overstay. I have had correspondence from colleagues whose constituents have taken a break at motorway service areas, as they are advised to do, only to overstay the two hours allowed because they have fallen asleep.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/4">The Government have taken decisive action during this Parliament to end clamping so that motorists no longer live in fear of their car being held hostage until they can pay for it to be released. I am sure that colleagues have heard horror stories from their constituents about the practices of clamping companies&#8212;practices</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/5">that we have stopped. No longer are people being marched to cash point machines to secure the release of their vehicle. In my constituency, we had a big issue outside Whitby station. In Whitby, every car park is free after 6 pm apart from the car park outside the station, so it is little wonder that many motorists assumed that it would be free there too. Surprise, surprise&#8212;the parking company did not turn up until after 6 o&#8217;clock on most days because it was keen to catch as many people as possible. Thankfully, the car park was in the control of Northern Rail. Alongside Whitby Hospitality Association, we ran the company out of town. We then made representations to Northern Rail, which engaged a much more benign parking company that acted more reasonably and, at the same time, controlled parking in the car park, which is important for those who wish to use the railway station or the Co-operative shop nearby. There are plenty of reasonable companies out there, but unfortunately some of the others give them a bad name.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/6">Good parking helps us to be good neighbours, and it is critical for a growing economy. However, as anyone who has driven round and round to find a space in a car park or has been blocked in will tell you, parking is not simple. The management of private parking can understandably be an emotive issue. Receiving a parking charge is never popular, but measures to control parking on private land are necessary to ensure that parking facilities remain accessible and provide value to all who use them.</p>

	<p pid="b.616.0/1">In the past few weeks there has been some talk about the fines that are imposed on those who allegedly park where they should not. There seems to be a grey area.

	<p pid="b.616.1/1">I need to be careful because this matter is before the courts. My hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley talked about somebody in a pay-and-display car park who overstayed their time. It could be argued that the loss to the parking company was the value of the time that had been used, and therefore that these fines amount to many times that loss.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.1/2">On the other hand, many businesses&#8212;my hon. Friend is a shopkeeper himself&#8212;rely on their own car parking areas outside their premises for their customers. If all the parking space outside a kitchen showroom, for example, was taken up by people who were not using that shop, the company could lose an order for a whole kitchen, which could represent several hundred pounds. We need to look more carefully at exactly why people may need to keep car parking for their customers. Many companies get frustrated when people park in the parking area that is meant to be for their customers and is integral to their business. If there is no car park outside, a person may drive by and go to a competitor.</p>

	<p pid="b.616.2/1">I understand the Minister&#8217;s point. However, The Whalley Arms car park is a relatively large car park for the village that is now used by the entire community, not for any specific shop. All the shops benefit from the fact that the car park is available. It is next door to a GP surgery. The two cases that I mentioned related to people who wanted to use the surgery; one</p>
	<p pid="b.616.2/2">wanted to pay and the other mistyped their registration number. Their loss is the amenity of the car parking space, which costs &#163;1 an hour or &#163;5 for the day&#8212;nowhere near &#163;60, &#163;100 or &#163;150.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.617.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="617"  time="020:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0003.htm#150316-0003.htm_spnew36">
	<p pid="b.617.0/1">I absolutely understand that point. The point I was trying to make is that there are situations whereby the survival of a business may be determined by it being able to make sure that its customers can use its limited car parking. However, in the case of a car park that might cost &#163;1 an hour, it would be difficult to argue that the loss to the landowner or the parking company was anything like the magnitude of the loss to another company that would lose custom.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/2">Drivers choose where to park their vehicles, and if they park on private land they do so in line with the terms and conditions that should be clearly displayed on signage at the entrance to the car park and around it. If the terms and conditions include that a motorist must pay and display, and stay no longer than the time they have paid for, those are the conditions that the motorist has deemed to have agreed to when they park their vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/3">Parking management and control is necessary so that landowners who invite drivers to park on their land can exercise their legal rights and gain the benefit to which they are entitled from the use of their property. Without any form of control, indiscriminate drivers might park where they liked and for as long as they liked, breaching reasonable terms and conditions, and without fear of any recourse arising from their misuse of the land.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/4">We are committed to striking the right balance to protect motorists from unscrupulous practices that some parking management companies may employ&#8212;we have heard about them this evening&#8212;and to ensure that landowners can control the use of their land and benefit fairly from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/5">The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 banned clamping and made a number of other changes to the law related to parking. It banned private sector wheel-clamping and vehicle removal where there is no lawful authority to do so, and, as a balance to that, provided landholders with extra powers to manage parking on their land.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/6">Most private organisations, including private landowners and their agents, are not able to clamp or tow vehicles and have to rely primarily on ticketing to enforce parking conditions on their land. This could be by placing a parking ticket on a vehicle, giving it to the driver or sending a ticket to the vehicle&#8217;s registered keeper in the post.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/7">Before the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, a private landholder could only seek liability against a vehicle driver to recover unpaid parking charges and therefore needed to be able to identify who was the driver of the vehicle that incurred the parking charge. There was no requirement, however, for the registered keeper either to say who was driving the vehicle or to accept liability him or herself. This allowed both the vehicle driver and the registered keeper to avoid liability and meant that landholders could find it difficult to manage parking by ticketing alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/8">Schedule 4 to the Protection of Freedoms Act came into power at the same time as the parking sector introduced a new, free appeals service for motorists who received a</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/9">parking charge. This means that motorists can appeal to the parking operator and to an independent adjudicator, and both those appeals are free to the motorist. However, I completely understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s point about an early payment discount, and the suggestion to extend the discount during an appeal certainly has some merit.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/10">Despite perceptions to the contrary, I assure my hon. Friend that significant control is already applied to the operation of private car parking companies. The activities and standards of operation in the sector have changed substantially in recent years and parking trade bodies have improved standards further at the heart of their vision.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/11">Where the terms and conditions of parking have been breached, parking management companies can apply for information about the vehicle keeper so that they can enforce appropriately. The Government control the access to those data through the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and there is a requirement for companies that receive keeper data from the DVLA to be members of an accredited trade association. Incidentally, the fee for access to those data is &#163;2.50. That means that the parking company must abide by the accredited trade association code of practice based on fair treatment of the motorist, which requires its members to operate to high professional standards of conduct while allowing them to take reasonable action to follow up alleged parking contraventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.617.0/12">We would expect any organisation that wanted to become an accredited trade association to be able to demonstrate that it has a code of practice that ensures that only a fair parking charge is asked for and that prominent signage is present outlining clearly the restrictions on parking and the charges and conditions that apply. There should be no hidden charges or ambiguity for the motorist as to what is and what is not permitted on the land.</p>

	<p pid="b.618.0/1">What does the Minister think about the fact that the terms and conditions can change? I mentioned the ambiguity of three hours of free parking being reduced to an hour and a half on match days, but without match days being specified.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2015-03-16b.618.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="618"  time="020:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm150316/debtext/150316-0003.htm#150316-0003.htm_spnew38">
	<p pid="b.618.1/1">I have not looked at that in any great detail, but from what my hon. Friend says, it seems unreasonable to expect a person to know when it is or is not a match day. It does not seem beyond the bounds of possibility to list days when there will be matches to address that particular situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/2">The code helps to ensure that contact with motorists is not threatening, and that parking charge notices are issued promptly so that a driver can recall the circumstances surrounding the event. A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for payment to be made before any additional charges are imposed or the matter is escalated.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/3">Even though strong requirements are in place to regulate the actions of parking companies, the disclosure of data from the DVLA is tightly controlled. Parking management companies are visited to audit their operations, and further in-depth checking of individual cases is undertaken to make sure that requests have been submitted for genuine reasons and with reliable evidence to back them up. Car parking operators pay fees when requesting keeper details. The fee levels are set to recover the cost of processing requests so that those costs are not passed</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/4">on to the taxpayer. The Government do not gain financially from the provision of such information, contrary to what one may read in some newspapers.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/5">Inevitably, motorists who feel that they have been unfairly treated will complain. The parking operator needs to demonstrate compliance with the code of practice of its accredited trade association to retain its membership. The ATA exists to investigate and ensure that, where appropriate, remedial action is taken. It is for the ATA to decide whether the operator needs to be placed on notice with additional scrutiny, follow-up audits and checks to monitor future actions closely. In more serious cases, a decision may be taken to terminate an operator&#8217;s membership of the ATA. A company can still manage parking on private land, but if it is no longer a member of the ATA the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency will not provide contact details to enable breaches to be pursued. That has a serious consequence for a company&#8217;s survival, and it is an incentive for it to behave responsibly.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/6">The DVLA plays a key role. Where sufficiently serious concerns are raised or ongoing issues are identified, it will consider whether continued access to vehicle keeper data is appropriate. Several parking management companies have had their ability to request vehicle keeper data suspended where shortfalls in the standards expected have been identified. In addition, trading standards departments can prosecute companies if they have breached consumer protection law. In short, if a company is not meeting the standards expected, there are serious consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/7">We recently announced a new package of changes to help tackle over-zealous parking enforcement. The changes are designed to help local shops, and they include the</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/8">introduction of grace periods. As we have heard, drivers will get a 10-minute grace period where they have legitimately parked on the street or in council-owned car parks. That will prevent penalties for being just a few minutes late back to the vehicle. We have also introduced a new right to enable residents and local businesses to demand that their council reviews parking in their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/9">Off-street parking has many synergies with policy about car park charges, land-use planning and high streets, so we have decided to transfer responsibility for all off-street parking to Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government. That will enable the Government to look more easily at the contribution that public and private off-street parking can make to a place, and how it can support local economic rejuvenation. Communities and Local Government Ministers will now turn their attention to the behaviour of off-street car park operators, and they intend to ensure that unfair and unreasonable behaviour is dealt with in the way that the Government have addressed on-street parking abuses.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/10">I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley to discuss any concerns he has directly with the parking operator, and if he is not satisfied, with the accredited trade association. Providing them with details of any cases in which his constituents have experienced questionable actions or bad behaviour will allow the ATA to investigate and to take the necessary action.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/11" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.1/12" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
